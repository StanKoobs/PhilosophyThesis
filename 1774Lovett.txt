ELECTRICAL PHILOSOPHER. CONTAINING d New Syſtem of Phyſics founded upon the Principle of an univerſal Plenum of elementary Fire, wherein the nature of elementary Fire is explain'd, its Office pointed out, its extenſive Influence and Utility in explaining many of the moſt abſtruſe Phenomena of Nature ſhewn, and the Grand Deſideratum in particular which has been hitherto either entirely given up as inexplicable, or elſe ſought after in vain by the moſt able Naturaliſts, is at length happily obtaind, viæ. the Cauſe of Gravity, the Cauſe of Coheſion, &c. &. The greater part of the Publication is diſpoſed in the form of a Dialogue, as the moſt familiar method of conveying Inſtruction, and the whole is offerd to the Public by way of Jqupplement to the Philoſophical Eſſays lately publiſhed by the ſame Author. To which is ſubjoid a P O ST C RI PT. Containing Strictures upon the uncandid Animadversions of the Monthly Reviewers on thoſe Eſſays.        BYy R.

That ſo few Enquiries have been made concerning its Nature and Uſes, ſeems the more unaccountable, ſince myriads of Experiments have been made;, all of which invite, as it were, our reſearches into ſo curious à ſubject. Can any thing then but an invincible pręjudice in favour of preconceived Opinions be imagind to be the cauſc of ſuch a reluctance to the inveſtigating of an object ſo promiſing and ſo intereſting as elementary Fire appears to be? ſa) (a) I call this Fire elementary from its great purity and univerſality, and its appearing in form of Air, b How       ii To the READE R. How aſſiduous were Philoſophers, particularly Mr. Boyle, in cultivating and improving the Pneumatic Engine; and with what unwearied diligence did he purſue the Experiments made therewith, although rhe moſt he could propoſe from them was the enquiring into the Nature and Properties of the common Air? How much more then might be reaſonably expected when by means of the Electrical Engine we had diſcoverd the pure, primary, elementary Air or £ther? Was it not reaſonable to think that Philoſophers would have exulted at the Diſcovery, and doubled their diligence in their Enquiries into the Nature of a Principle which they always before imagined had no xiſtence? But inſtead of availing themſelves of a light which unexpectedly appeared in order to conduct them to Truth, they ſeem to have ſitten ſupinely for near thirty Years aſter the Diſcovery; as if nothing had happend worthy their notice. Such thoughts brought to my mind an Obſervation of the Rev. Mr. Jones's, viz. e Electricity, which has given to  this Age an Advantage over all that went  before it, anũ ſhould have oped to us a  new world of Philoſophy, has Ieft us juſt  where it found us, and there we muſt neceſſarily remain till we can prevail with onſelves to cultivate and improve the Diſcoverĩcs alreudy made, and begin the ſearch of Nature aſreſ. I would not be underſtood by this  abandon Sir Iſuac Newton, but ſo far from A : aat,   / To the RE AD E R.ii it, that I am throughly convinced, ãll atrempts will prove vain and fruitleſ, if wẽ do not procoœd uon his Principless Unleſs we purſue the Diſcoveries which Sir Iſaac has already made, it will be abſolutely impoſſible to underſtand the nature of the electrical Fluid, ſo as to explain, in a ſatisfactory manner, even the very Experiments which we are moſt familiar with. Wnhat I mean by the Diſcoveries that Sir Iſaac has already made, is, Firſt, the inherent or natural Properties of ther, viz. its indefinite elaſticity and rarity, and, Secondly, its exiſtence in the pores of all groſs bodies. If theſe things be not ſtrictly attended to, it will be in vain to attempt the explanation either of the newly diſcoverd Fire, or of the Experiments made with it. Such Aſſertions may probably be cenſurd as the effects of crude and preeſpitate Refexions; but I can with great Truth airm they are ſo far from baſty thoughts, that they have been cultivated with the ſtricteſt and moſt deliberate attention, and I am therefore very certain that the Experiments are not explicable on any other Principles whatever. Surely the candid and judicious will not cenſure and condemn me for affirming ſo peremptorily, that which I am throughly convinced of from a crowd of unbiaſ'd witneſſes: Or in other words, if the Experiments be ever ſo much diverſified, they are ſure to ſtrengthen and confirm ęach other, when examined on the aforeb 2 ſaid   SO— ſ ææ.- tat u m ZinuE æ ar uh Var s i l r taid plan, viz. that of ſuch an indefinite elaſticlty and rarity. hat ſo intereſting a Diſecorery has liin ſ Tong uncultivated by cthers, ſeems the more remarkable, when we reflect on the jealouſies tliãt Baye ſubſiſfted among Men, when all, that has been eontended for, was perhaps a little empty honour of being the arũ hn ventor of a Rule or Method for ſolving particular geometrieal Problems ſu): Or being the Author of ſome new Picosusy in Agonomy ũ    a5 iLi (a) How great the contention was beteen the Engli 7 and ſrrench Geometricians concerning the Invention of Fluxions is well known: The former maintaining that Sir Ifæao Newton was ſiie ſifſt Inventor of them; the latter, that they were invented by Mr. Leibnit2?? (b) Dr. Deſaguliers aſter mentioning Dr. Bradley 5 mẽthod of finding the annual Parallax of the bright Star iu the head ©oſ Dreco, adds,  So that now the motiun of ſhe Earth is  ſettled by aſtronomiral Obſervation, This Diſcovery of ſo : great Conſequence to Aſtronomy, which has been attempted in vain for many ages, and at laſt made in the Year 1728 is yet mention'd no where that I know of, but in the Phliloſophical Tranſaciions. Had this heen found out  hy ſome Forcigners, we ſhould have had wholè Volumes written about it in a pompous manner bẽfore this time. ſt is ſurpriſing that in the term of fve years ſinee the s Publication oſ it, none oſ the learned Gentlemen abroad  have taken any notice of it, either to object againſt, or # acquieſcè in it.  This ſhews us, he ſays, that the Parallax of the  ſixed Stars is much ſmaller than has hitherto been ſuppoſed ũ by thole who have pretended to deduee ĩit ſrom their  OWſervations; ſor. inſtcad of many ſeconds it does not s amount to -ne: Hence it ſollows that the above:mentioned ta7 s ahove ,o0600 times ſarther ſrom us thah the Sun.» See Dr, De ſuguliers on Experimenſãl Fhiloſophy, Vol, I. page ”86, m To _-—————— .;;-y 4Fo find out the true nature and inher eſſential ropu of the electric matter I may truly ſay, been the principal or rather ihe ſole objęct o my attention and ſtudy, almoſtever ſince, the great force of the Leyden Phial was diſcoverd, in order to onquire into the difference of the nature of the electrical fluid and common matter; the former of which is dound to be endued vith real activity, hilit ihę Iatter remains æntirely paſſive and inert. As Sir Iſnac Newton was the only one amo modern Philoſophers, who had ſtudied the nature of ſuch a fubtile Medium ſo far as to juveſtigate the laws by which it was govern'd, I happily conſulted his Writings concerning it; happily I ſay, having ſince diſcoverd it to be the only ſucceſ™ful method I could have taken; r to him alone we are indebted for that which is ſinee found to be the only guiding clue to the moſt important Diſcoveries, that is, to thoſe inherent properties of indefſinitely great elaſticity and rarity of the ſubtile Fluid abou- mentioned, of which we have, by means of electrical Experiments, made a moſt complete Diſovery. To him alſo and to him only, are we indebt.d for pointing out its exiſtence in the pores of all groſ bodies: For the inveſtigation of the former, Seœ his Optios; Quære æ21. or the beginning of Chap. V. page 67 of my Eſſays; and of the latter, See the concluding Paragraph of his Principia, or my Eſſays, p. 36. ſect. T 5T Ha  Had it not been for thefe important Dſſcoveries of Sir Iſaae, electrical PhiloſXphers as well as all others; had been intirely deſtitute oſ a rational Method to explain any of the electrical Experiments, ſo as to render them reconcileable with one another, whereas by means of the foremention'd Aſſiſtance they are enabld, as with a Key, to unlock many of the greateſt difficulties, relating to electrical Experiments, which, as before obſerved, it would be in vain to attempt on any other plan; and ſuch vain attempts I am fully perſuaded are the onl Reaſons why the electrioal Fluid ſeems mſl given up as inexplicable, and indeed ever ſince the firſt Diſcovery of that wonderful Power of Naoture, the elementary Fire, I have ſnewn as great propenſity to enquire into its Nature, Office, and the Uſes it was ordained to ſerve' in the mundane Syſtem, as others have a reluctance to ſuch an enquiry. I muſt further inform the Reader that alth the principal part of this Supplement ĩs intended to conſiſt of Dialogues, yet, as ſome portions of it could not properly be digeſted into a colloguial Form, the whole is to be conſiderd as a Miſcellany of Dialogues, Quotations, Recapitulations, &e. And I flatter myſelf ſuch an indulgence will bę readily granted me when it is conſidered that I am the only one ho has attempted to make a minute Enquiry into the Nature and Office of this univerſal Fire, and who am conſequently deſtitute of the conmimon Priviledge of otherAuthors, viZ.  that of òtnſulting the Writings of thoſe: who  have gone hefore them on the ſame Subject. lir æn ſlov But aſter every Indulgence I can hope for from the Public, I ſhall think it ever incumhent upon me to make the ſame Confeſſion vhich my Heart dictated to my Pen when I was engaged in the publication of my Eſſays, viZ.  That, ſenſible of my deficiency, I think iIt my duty to apologize for an attempt of this naturẽ rather than to plead any thing for  the merit of the Work.” However, Fred with a Love of Truth, and animated by the Candor and Encouragement of the moſt reſpectable and diſcerning part of my Readers, I have ventured once more to crave their attention to a Subject, which-my want of Literature in a great meaſdre diſqualifies me from doing that fuſtice. to, which it deſerves and demands at our hands. But Truth, evidenced by Experiment, will ſpeak beſt for itſelf, and needeth not thoſe Embelliſhments and Flowers of diction by which alone Hypotheſis are generally ſupported: And I flatter myſel?i that the time cannot be very diſtant in this illumined Age, when that ?ruly natural and ration⸗l Philoſophy, which Electricity has pointed out to us, will be univerſally adoptęd and approved. N. B. I cannot help remarking here in brief, that my Endeavours to elucidate ihis Subject, have met with ſome Oppoſition; but nu or encouraged, I ſhall leave to the judicious to determine, requeſting only of them, an attentive and candid peruſal of the following Pages. ã a σ”7 Sub- gen, st-m ſto J ſ s1a. 55&,5m 3  s- .5 Beæ ꝶ . 4ſ5 SUBSCRIBERS NAMES.

Y Philoſophical Eſſays having been ſevenYears publiſhed, and notwithſtanding they have been ſtigmati?’d as hetorodox, yet, as they have never been anſwer'd by way of ſerious Refutation, but on the contrary, honourd with Encomiums by various eminent Authors, amongſt whom were ſome of the moſt profeſs and judicious Critics of the preſent Age, () I am encouraged to hope that they have been look'd upon as founded on rational Principles, notwithſtanding their variation from receivd opinions: Iſhall however flatter myſelf that I have ſufficient reaſon to think ſo, until ſuch principles be diſprovd and ſet aſide by more convincing arguments, and ſupported by Experiments equally concluſive. Since therefore they have been well receivd by many, and the peruſal of them recommended by impartial and learned Men, I am excited to put Pen to Paper again on the ſame Subject, more eſpecially as Experience and Ob-  (a) The Authors of the Critical Review were ſo candid as not only to give a brief account of ſome of the principal parts of the Eſſays, but to conclude with a commendatory Character of them— See Critical Review for October 1766. B ſer- ſervation have ſince furniſd me with a variety of other uſeful Diſcoveries, which enable me to ũluſtrate and confirm what I before advanced. What I have more to offer is therefore intended as a Supplement to thoſe Eſſays. Being in company with a facetious ſpeculative Gentleman, and the converſation happening to turn on Electricity, he declar'd that the Electrical Phenomenon ſeemd ſo ſurpriZingly abſtruſe and myſterious, as in his opinion never to be rationally accounted: for on any natural principles whatever, ſo as to be renderd intelligible. I told him I was far from thinking ſo, and that the rendering of it ſo plain as to be eaſily underſtood was the principal, or rather the only Reaſon why Iundertook to write my Philoſophical Eſſays; and that I could not help thinking Ihad ſo far fucceeded in the Attempt, that little could be found wanted in them to render the Electrical Appearances and their cauſes perfectly intelligible, particularly if they were perus'd attentively, and impartially examined with that view. N. B. I ſhall proceed in the preſent enquiry as if ſtill confabulating with the ſame Gentleman, by way of a familiar Dialogue between a and B. I Dialogue mnot an eſſential Property of FinE The PorES of WaTER replete ith VPVFmmEQuicxs ILVER froæen. B. JXVY early viſit, Sir, this Morning is M y occaſioned by what I have heard 5æ ſince our laſt Converſation. I was mentioning in a ſelect Company what you advanced relating to Electricity, and they ſeem'd to cenſure you, or rather to ſet you at nought, for theſe threæ Reaſons: Firſt, as an Innovator, that maintained heterodox Principles. Secondly, that you are too precipitant in your Application of the electrical Fluid, before a ſufficient number of Experiments had been made to confirm ſuch reaſoning.

As for their firſt Reaſon, that of cenſuring me for maintaining Principles different from the generality of Mankind; tis preſumd I may B 2 ap- appeal to all judicious and candid Men, whether it be a jut Reaſon for Cenſure, if others have not made the ſame Enquiry into thoſe things about which we differ. Their Second Reaſon, that of being too forward in my Enquiry as to the Nature and Uſes of the electrical Fluid, before a ſufficient number of Experiments had been made by way of examination into the nature of it, I am at a loſi to know, ſince Myriads of Experiments have been already made, and more are daily makin endes I can aſſure them that ſuch a multiplicity of Experiments are not abſolutel neceſſary; a few well choſen ones will be found to be abundantly ſufficient. Nor can they ſay that a ſufficient Iength of time to make a fair Trial has been wanted; Experiments having been made with it confiderably more than fifty Years fince modern improvements; Firſt, by Mr. Haukſbee; next by Mr. Stephen Grey of the Charter Houſe; with Mr. Du Faye, and others. As to their laſt Reaſon it will be neceſſary for me, in order to wipe off ſuch an Opprobrium from my Book, to inform the heedleſs and injudicious Reader, (for no other I may well ſuppoſe could miſtake my meaning) that altho it aſſerts that Heat is not eſſential tc Fire, and produces a variety of Inſtances to prove that in many caſes Fire ſnews no ſigns of Heat, yet at the ſame time it main-   maintains that the greateſt Heat of all is the effect of Fire only, and ſhews by what means it was produced; (a) therefore to prevent Errors of the ſame kind for the future, I am inclined to think it neceſſary for me to recapitulate ſome of thoſe parts of the Eſſays which relate more particularly to that Subject, eſpecially the Definition of Fire and Heat, and the Obſervation on cold Fire.

H E AT is an accidental Property or Quality of Fire generated at pleaſure by the mutual Attrition of tbe Particles of the Fire; or in other words, when Heat is producd by the Attrition of two Bodies, the ſtrict and proper cauſe of such Heat is the mutual Attrition of the Particles of the Fire contained in thoſe Bodies, conſequently Heat is the effect of that mutual Attrition. Hence Heat is generated, increaſed, and continued in proportion to the violence and continuance of that mutual Attrition of the Particles of the Fire; and we ſhall have ſuſficient Reaſon to believe (when we come to fhew the method by which the greateſt Heat was was produced that ever has been known) that if it were poſſible to diveſt any two Bodies of the Fire contained in their pores or interſtices, no Heat at all would be produced by the friction, tho ever ſo violently and ever ſo long continued. IEE Hence alſo, though the vulgar expreſſion hot as Fire implies that Heat is the very Eſſence of it, yet if we do but reflet on the Efſects of the foregoing Experiments, we mhall behold a cloud of Witneſſes all of them ready to teſtify, that Heut is not an eſſential Property of Fire; for Fire is not always hot, even when capable of melting Metals, if effected by Electricity. Dr. Franklin melted braſs Pins, and ſteel Needles, Gold, and Glaſs.  And though ſays he æ I have taken  up the pieces of Glaſs between my Fingers  mmediately after this melting; I never  cod perceive the leaſt warmth in them. Dr. Franklin's Letters, Edit. 2d. p. 66. Again, Thd Water is naturally cold, yet we find the pores of no one thing more plentifully ſtored with Fire than thoſe of Water; nor is there any thing beſides Metals, from which pure Fire can be ſo plentifully obtaind. Since then it always exiſts in Water while in a Fluid form, who can doubt the truth of the Aſſertion of the great Experimentaliſt Dr. Borhaave; viz.  that an incredible Quantity  of Fire is contaid in the coldeſt maſſes  of Ice, and may be inſtantly produced from s them e them with a great deal of Violencet (a) But although it ſeems true from the Premiſes, that Fire is frequently coLD; yet that can be only in a limited Senſe, ſince Bodies are only comparatively cold or hot. That which is greater than the heat of the human Body we term hot, and that which is leſs, we term cold, though in a more unlimited Senſe Fire may not improperly be ſaid to be always poſſeſſed of heat and motion too in ſome degree. To render myſelf on this head the more plain and intelligible, I muſt tranſcribe another pafſlage from the abovementiond celebrated Author on Heat and Motion, tho to ſay the truth, he confounds the terms Heat and Fire.  There is ſtill another motion,, ſays he, s which I aſcribe to Fire, which is the con-  ſtant effect of its proper agility; and this is  moſt evidently demonſtrated by undeniable  Obſervations. Let us, for inſtance, conſider  Water when it is 35 degrees cold, and iĩt  will then be in its coldeſt State; that is, ĩt s will contain as ſmall à portion of Fire, as in s the nature of Things can poſſibly reſide in s pure Water; for if this ſimple Water be  effected with a greater degree of Cold, it will s not continue Water any longer, but be . converted ; into a pellucid heitile Subſtance  a) Boerhaaves Elements of Chymiſtry, Dallow Tranſlation, Page 8i. cf5 called called Ice, tho reducible again to Water by a heat of 35 Degrees. Hence therefore it appears evident, that Water is Water only by the Motion of the Fire refiding in it, and that it is not Water from its own Nature conſiderd ſeparately and alone: The ſame is true of Glaſs, Foſſils, Sulphurs, Semi-Metals, Metals, and perhaps of all other Bodies, which appear in a conſiſtent form in a ſmaller degree of Heat, but are put in ſuſion and converted into a kind of Water if the ſame is increaſed to a certain degree, which will be different, according to the various Natures of the Subſtance under Examination. Since therefore by Fahrenheits Thermometer the natural Heat has been obſervd 33 degrees below the ſreezing Point, hence we ſee evidently, that thro' all the difference of 35 degrees the Fire was agitated with a motion that grew gradually leſs and leſs, but was never totally deſtroy'd; and therefore even at that Time, when all Animals and Vegetables perjſhed thro the exceſs of the cold, the Fire was not abſolutely at reſt. Therefore we may ſafely aſſert, that the Fire was even then in motion. But as it appears from Experiments, that this Fire may be diminiſhd artificially ſtill 40 degrees more, we are hence certain, that Fire, in the greateſt natural cold poſſible, is agitated 40 degrees more than it is in this artificial one, and s that  that again thro every intermediate degree it  is continually diſſolving ſome Bodies, which è a little after in a ſmaller degree of Heat,  appear of a ſolid Conſiſtence. Fire, there-  fore, is perpetually agitated in the greateſt  Cold, and ſtill gradually more and more in  every increaſe of Heat; and conſequently is  always hot and in motion. See my Eſſays, Page 248. Section 16o. 4N. B. There is another fluid Subſtancè not yet taken much notice of, which requires the greateſt degree of cold of all others to convert it into a ſolid, namely, that of Quickſilver; which is of late Years found to become ſo by means of a certain degree of cold, as well as Water and many other Things. q See, an Account of artificial cold produced at the Royal Academy of Sciences at Peterſburgh, by Doctor Himſelf. In a Letter to Doctor De Caſtro, F.R. S. Tranſlated from the French by James Parſons, M. D. F. R. S. from the Philoſophical Tranſactions.  This Effect was produced by means of a freezing mixture by which Fahrenheit's Thermometer was reduced 652 degrees lower than the 40 degrees before mentiond, the ſum of which is 105or to ſpeak more intelligibly, if Fahrenheit's Thermometer is at 105; degreess when the Mercury pegins to freeze, and at 33 vhen the Water begins to freeze, conſequently the Motion and C 2 Heat  Heat of the Fire comaind in each will be as thoſe numbers, that is, the ſmalleſt degree ot motion and heat, which is juſt ſufficient to melt the ſolid Quick ſilver, and the increas’d motion and heat, which is juſt ſufficient to melt the ſolid W ater, are as the number 1Io 53 x and the number ;3 f From ſuch a method of Reaſoning, we may conceive all the different degrees of Motion and Heat in agitated Fire, from the Ieaſt to the greateſt, that is, from the ſmalleſt degree of the motion and heat of Fire which melts the ſolid Quickſilver, even to the greateſt imaginable, namely, that ſurpriſing degree of motion and heat which is produced at the Focus of Villettes Mirrour.  N. B. This muſt be a more intelligible way of arguing, than that of Heat and Cold; for as it is allowed that Heat is only relative, that is, the Heat which is leſs than that of the human Body, we term cold, and that which exceeds ſuch Heat, we call hor; Heat and Cold therefore cannot be ſo juſt a diſtinction, as to term them different degrees of Heat; becauſe it is not a little difficult to know where to place the Zero (or o) on the Thermometer, to point out where the Cold begins. If this Diſtinction be diſliked on account of the manner of deſining it, the World will be much indebted to any one, vho can ſhew where to fix the ſtandard on the Thermometer that will ſhew where the Cold ends, and the eieSS the Heat begins. Hence appears the neceſſity of making choice of the moſt adequate Terms. The foregoing Obſervations being duly conſiderd, it evidently appears that Fire is never totally deſtitute of Heat, nor conſequently of Motion, from the greateſt degree to the leaſt: And if we uſe the ſame Authors Term, Cold inſtead of leſs degree of Heat, then we ma ſay, that Fire in the greateſt artificial Cold, that is poſſible, is agitated 65 degrees and an half m than it is in the forementiond artificial one of 40 degrees, i. e. 105, from Which greateſt degree of Cold, through every intermediate degree, ĩt is continually diſſolving fome Bodies which a little before in a ſmaller degree of Heat appeard of a ſolid Conſiſtence. Fire therefore is perpetually agitated in the greateſt Cold, and ſtill gradually more and more in every increaſe of Heat, and conſequently is always hot and in motion. By the help of this Recapitulation I hope I have ſo fully declard my Sentiments on Fire, and the cauſe of Heat, that no one will have the leaſt room to think that I ever was ſo inconſiſtent with myſelf, as even to inſinuate that I ſuppos'd there was no Heat in Fire. ,, The Analogy or degree of proportion between the Elaſticity and Rarity of the common Air, and the ſame Properties in Ether, was according to Sir Iſaac Newton as 700000 to I. l It (a) It was this remarkable Difference of thoſe inherent Properties, which was the cauſe of my making a more peculiarly ſtrict ſcrutiny into it, than I ſnod otherwiſe have done”.

But more of this hereaſter. Theſe Diſcoveries of that great Philoſopher, of the remarkable Rarity and Elaſticity of æther are abſolutely neceſſary to be known, before the Experiments can be render'd intelligible, or even reconcileable to one another; (4.) which if duly attended to, will prove (as was obſervd in mv Eſſays) a Key to ſolve and unlock moſt other Difficulties throughout all the Operations of Nature. B. I muſt own that your Arguments ſeem ſo rational and perſuaſive, as to excite my Curioſity to become better acquainted with this amazing Power of Nature, ſince you aſſure me the thing is not ſo very difficult as I imagined, and particularly, if it be examin'd with attention and impartiality. In order therefore to do it the more effectually I will undertake the peruſal of your Eſſays again; for alth?

Before you begin the Book again, it will be neceſſary to inform you, that the electrical Fluid is in form of an extremely elaſtic Air, and, as you will find, indubitably provd to be true and real Fire, and withal, as pure as the ſolar Fire in the Focus of a burning Glaſi, ſince like that it yields neither Smoke, Aſhes, nor any other groſs Matter. And here I muſt previouſly obſerve to you, that this is what the Ancients and ſome few of the more diſcerning Moderns have termd elementary Fire; how they diſcoverd that ſuch a Principle exiſted, and particularly that it was Fire is not eaſy to conceive; and notwithſtanding this their Deſcription of it was jut what we find it to be, ſince we have made ſo complete a Diſcovery of it, as even to realize it to the Senſes. You will likewiſe find that it appears to be an univerſal Agent in the ſtricteſt Senſe, ſo as to occupy and fill all Space, not only all free and open Spaces, but the minuteſt vacuities and interſtices or pores of the moſt compact and ſolid Bodies, agreeable to the Prediction of Sir Iſaac Newton as we find it in the concluding Paragraph of his Principia, as hinted above, and as will more fully appear from Experiments in various parts of the Eſſays, particularly at Pages 37. 38. 39. and 40. &c. ili B.  ( 19) B. What do you really believe might be ſafely concluded concerning its Nature, Office; and general Uſe? A. Were I to declare my own private Sentiments to you, I ſhoud affirm, without any heſitation, that this grand Principle is the primary or firſt, and indeed, ſole Cauſe of all other ſecondary Cauſes whatſoever.That it is indefinitely elaſtic, and acts by preſſure or an impelling force; the mechanical Cauſe that we breathe, live, and move; the efficient Cauſe of all motion; the phyſical Cauſe of Gravitation, Coheſion, Magnetiſm, the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, and of all other the moſt abſtruſe Phenomena of Nature. B. Why, my Friend, you take moſt amplo ſtrides indeed IT am afraid Electricity has turn'd your Head; ſince you go on thus, I muſt look upon you as a down right Enthuſiaſt, and that you are electrically mad. A. You may, Sir, rally and banter me as you pleaſe, and think that Ihave taken unwarrantable ſteps; but I am perſuaded you will find that I am not the only Perſon who has aſfirmd very great things of this univerſl powerful Principle, which Electricity has diſcoverd to us. As firſt, Dr. Franklin has undeniably provd by his Experiments, that the electrical Fluid and the Fire of Lightning are indubitably the fame, affirming that the greateſt known Effects of Lightning may be exceeded by it. Secondly, we are informd by tht learned llll D Dr. - Dr. Priſtly, in his Hiſtory of Electricity, that it ĩs the general opinion of the moſt learned Electricians, that the Aurora Borealis, falling gtars, all Meteors in the Air, Water-Spouts &c. at Sea, Whirlwinds and Hurricanes by Land and even Earthquakes are electrical Phenomena: This is the clear opinion of Dr. Stutely, whoſe ingenious Papers on the fame Subject were read and approved by the Royal Society (4). The moſt judicious and juſtly admired Author the Rev. Mr. Yones another ingenious Electrician, after ſpeaking of Electricity, proceeds yet farther, and affirms there is hardly a motion in nature which this  Fluid, when applied by a diligent Experi-  mentaliſt, is not capable of producing.  It will give a rectilinear motion in all di-  rections; will produce the motions of Ro-  tation and Revolution; it will keep a Body  ſuſpended at a certain diſtance in the Au without any viſible cauſe, and make it turn ſwiftly on its Axis; it accelerates Vegetation, increaſes the motion of Blood in the Arteries, raiſes Water into Tides, and, in a wordòd, vill ſhew itſelf as anatural Inſtrument to bæ  little leſs than All-Sufficient (a) B.

Whatever you may think, I have affirmd no more concerning its Univerſality, Nature, Office, and ſeveral Uſes, than what appears not only prohable, but what has been confirmd by undeniable Evidence and actual Experience, as all ſincere unprejudiced Enquirers after Truth, who are eonverſant with electrical Experiments, are throughly convinced of; for which, and other like reaſons, it is my humble opinion that it ought to be eſteemed as ſacred, i. e. delegated by the wiſe Author of Nature to be the principal, if not the only inſtrument which he has appointed and makes uſe of to execute his Divine Will throughout the mundane Syſtem. Iam therefore ſo far from retracting what I have aſſirm'd of it, that I am fully convinced I do not overrate its Excellence in calling it an univerſal, mechanical Inſtrument of Nature; nor will you find when you read over my Eſſays with attention, thatI have exaggerated or gone beyond what is there prov'd by the moſt convincing Experiments.

Ir (23) ir Iſaac Newton was of opinion,  that a ſubtile Medium not only exiſted, but alſo that it was the Phyſical Cauſe of all ihe capital Phenomena in the univerſe æ Whereas we, that have made a great Diſcovery of it; ſeem to look upon the Sentiments of ſo great a Man, as unworthy our cultivation and attention. And, even you yourſelf, had you read my Eſſays with care, might have been able to judge for yourſelf of theſe Matters. There you wou'd have ſeen how cautious I was, and the care I took that I might impoſe neither on myſelf nor others. When I firſt began my enquiries, finding that Air was a principal Agent in producing ſuch wonderful effects in Electricity, I was led to enquire more particularly into the Nature, Properties and conſtituent Parts of the Atmoſphere, accordingly I conſulted the moſt authentic Writers on that ſubject; and particularly the learned Biſhop Berkeley, who had beſtow'd much time and pains on it, and adopted many of the Opinions of the Ancients concerning Air (a). After purſuing ſuch enquiries, I diſcoverd that the electrical Fire itſelf was only a more pure and exquiſitely elaſtic Air: I was therefore convinced that I could not fix my Firſt Principles on any Baſis ſo firm as on Air, which are, as you will find, in Eſſays, Page 22.

This method of Inftiruction might be very good, if my Head, like a common Place- book, could retain every thing that was committed to it, but as that is not the caſe, I muſt beg you to be fomewhat more æxplicit, and male Recapitulations wherever they may ſeem moſt requiſite, otherwiſe a great part of your trouble vill be thrown away; that ĩs, if you dont repeat the whole Paſſage where ſuch Repetitions are neceſſary. A. I eannot but own that your obſervation ĩs juſt, and that mere references might not be always ſufficient; I will ſherefore, according to your deſire, be more particular, eſpecially as you ſeem determined to purſue the Subject in good earncſt. Beſides fhould Iever have a mind mind to publiſh this Conference, thoſe Readers who have never ſeen the Eſſays, will be a well pleas'd with the Quotations as you; And though ſome might cenfure them as ſuperfiuous, they may eaſily paſs over them; and Iam convinced that in a Performance of this kind ſuch Repetitions cannot well be avoided, except we chooſe to ſacrifice perſpicuity to conciſeneſę. 3lt B. I muſt now beg you to inform me what are the moſt eſſential Properties of this fubtile elaſtic Medium? i A. An almoſt inconceivably great Eſſticity, and yet as extreme a Rarity or Fineneſ as before mentiond. However, it muſt be owned, that we are highly indebted to Sir Haæac Newton for pointing them out. For had it not been for his aſſſtance,, ve might have been ſtill, and probably a much longer time, groping as it were in the dark after them, and perhaps never have been able to anſwer that Queſtion ſatisfactorily. When deſcribing his fubtile Medium or ſErher, he informs us, that it is 700000 times more elaſtie than the Air and above 700000 times more rare. Query 2 1ſt. But although ſuch a ſubtile Medium, as Sir Iſaac then conjecturd to exiſt, is now actually diſcoverd by the cleareſt Experiments, and even realiz'd to the Senſes, and which we find to be poſieſt of thoſe remarkable Properties which are above mentioned in a ſurpriſing degree; yet, we were ii not not aware, nor could ever have j imagin'd, that the proportion of thoſe, natural. properties or qualitiesi in the æther, and. the ſame properties in common Air. was; ſo, great as 700000 to I, had we not heen throughly convinc'd by Experiment of its extremely great Elaſticiry and Rarity. . In the next Query he ſays, if this Ether be ſuppos d 700000 times more elaſtic, and abovę 700000 times more rare, ĩts Reſiſtance would be above 600000000 times leſs than that of Water, and ſo ſmall a Reſiſtance would ſcarcœe make any ſenſible alteration in the motion of the Planets in 10000 Years. Here Sir Iſaac ſeemed to doubt whether ſo great a Rarity woud be credited; therefore to obviate ſuch an objection he ſeems to demand an anſwer. to another Queſtion, ſaying, if any one ſhould aſk how a Medium can be ſo rare, let him tell me how the Air in the upper parts of our Atmoſphere, can be above a hundred thouſ/nd thouſand times rarer than Gold? : Before the real diſcovery of ſuch a ſubtile Medium by means of the electrical Apparatus, the very exiſtence of any ſubtile Medium, beſides that of common Air was denied and rejected vith ſovereign contempt, and ĩs ſtill diſbelieved by very many, notithſtanding it is moſt clearly verified by Experiments even 10 our bodily Senſes. Hence thè invinſible power of Prejudic] in favour of preconceived Opinions, inſomuch as Et to to deny the plaineſt Facts. Thoſe two inherent Properties appear in the electrical Fluid in a moſt wonderful degree, though the exact Proportion to the ſame Properties in common Air is not eaſy to aſcertain: But by means of theſe two Properties in the electrical æther, together with what was before hinted of its lying hid in all groſs Bodies, the Experimenſs are ſolvd in a rational manner, which would otherwiſe be abſolutely impoſſible. Of all the great Diẽòrerie made by Sir Iſaac Newton, thoſe of the extreme elaſticity and rarity of æther will be found to be by no means the leaſt, notwithſtanding there hath hitherto been very little notice taken of them: However, I am confident they will be found abſolutely neceſſary, before any conſiderable advances can be made towards explaining the Experiments. See the Inveſtigation of thoſe inherent properties, Optics, Query 2 Iſt. or in the Eſſays Page 68. Section 142. DBut as ncither of them may be ready at hand, I ſhall, for the information of my new Subſcribers, repeat the Inveſtigation, and the rather ſince ſome other things may by that means be rendered more clea,. VVFirſt, That the Medium which propagates Sound is the common Air or Atmoſphere; and that the ther beyond the Atmoſphere is the Medium which propaguies Light from the Sun. He then confiders the different Velocities of Light and Sound,. and obſerves, Secondly, that lEES E Sound r Sound moves no more than the ſpace of roo Miles in much about the ſame ſpace of time that Light moves from the Sun to the Earth, which diſtance Sir Iſaac computed at 70 Millions of Miles; ſo that the former is containd in the latter 700000 times (a). This datum ſlender as it may ſeem, was, yet ſufficient for his inveſtigation of the proportion of that remarkable inequality, or difference, of the Elaſticity and Rarity of the ſubtile elaſtic Medium or æther, and the ſame qualities in the elaſtic Air (4); the following are his own words.  Sounds move about 1r140 Englih Feet s in a ſecond minute of time; and in 7 or 8  minutes of time, they move about 100  Engliſh Miles.

B. I don't underſtand Sir Iſaac, ſince he makes uſe of the words Denſity and Rarity promiſcuouſly, as if they were ſimilar, notwithſtanding they are oppoſite Terms. A. If you conſider the Purport of his Reafoning, you will find that the above mention'ũ denſity is ſo extremely ſmall, that it is in reality, rarity; the greatneſs of the rarity and the ſmallneſs of the denſity being the ſame thing, and Sir Iſaac himſelf in the next words ealls it Rarity. B. I ſhould be glad to be informed coneerning the expanding force of an elaſtic Fluid, I cannot poſſibly form any adequate Idea of the nature of it. What can be the Mechani-   (a) Sir Iſaac Newton by allowing the Suns Parallax to be 12 made the diſtance to be about 70,000000 of Miles; whereas, according to later and repeated obſervations made vith the moſt accurate aſtronomical Inſtruments, the Sun» horizontal Parallax is not much more than 8 ſeconds and an half, whence the diſtance of the Sun from the Earth cãnnot be leſs than 95,000000 Engliſh Miles, arid if to avoid Fractions, we are allowed to call it in round Numbers, 100,000000, thẽn, by analogy, the elaſtic Force of this Medium in proportion to its fenũty muſt be, according to Sir Iſaac's method of inveſtigation, above 1,000000 multiplied by 1,000000, i. e. above a Rũiion of Million. Times greater than the elãſtic force of the Air is in proportion to its denſity, conſequently we may be allowed to call it an indefinite number of rimes more rare and more elaſtic than the common Air. E 2 cal cal cauſe of ſuchan expanding forte, and what can be the form of the primitive pasticles that conſtitute ſuch a Fluid? A. This is not eaſy to aſcertain: Mr. BoYIe was of Opinion that the primary particles of ſuch a Fluid, fine as they are and imperceptible to the Senſe, muſt be in form like f many little Watch-ſprings, coil'd and contorted in the nature of ſpirals, but infinitely more perfect, ſince theſe act every way, and every way alike in a ſpherical manner. 8B. But if this ſpiral-like form of the Air be neceſſary to cauſe the elaſticity of it, we muſt be allowd to ſuppoſe the ſame ſpirals in VWater, th an incompreſſible Fluid: The ſteam of boiling Water appears by its effects to be equally elaſtic with the Air. Water incloſed woud, if ſufficiently heated, burſt the ſtrongeſt Veſſol. In the Aolipile its elaſticity is as manifeſt as that of the Air. Are the particles of Water then ofa ſpiral- like form, and is the Suppoſition neceſſary? If it is not neceſſary to account for the elaſticity of Water, it cannot be ſo to account for that of the Air. It would be abſurd to feign a ſet of ſpringy particles in Water. A., You ſeem to have forgatten what electrieity has renderd moſt clear, viæ. that the pores of all groſs Bodies are replete with electrical: Fire which is only a more pure Air, and is always expunded by heat. Steam Is æ compoſition conſiſti ting of the primary Air, v ther, 0:510ũ ( 31) ther, or true Fire; blondet with 3he- particles of Water (a). This Firęin the ſteam; is as elaſtic in the 7Eolipile &. as in the common Air; but the elaſticity of the ſteam is by no means the effect of the watery particles, but of thãt of the Fire in the pores of the Water. LB: Before we proceed any further you muſt give me leave to tell you that your Philoſophical: Principles ſeem to me ſo very hetorodoæ, that I cannot call you a Newtonian; I ſiovd therefore be glad to know what to ſtile you as a Philoſopher; ſhall I call you a Hutchinſonian? E llli A. I was always a profeſſed Enemy to Parties of all Denominations, (at Ileaſt, ever ſince I was capable of judging) on account of the heat and animoſities ſubſiſting amongſt them, and the illiberal Names they ſo frequently beſtow on one another,even to the Scãndal of all: Parties, and therefore cannot help having an utter Averſion to Parties in Philoſophy, as well as in Theology. And as to the Hutchinſonians I nevir ſaw any of their Writings, and am conſequently a ſtranger to their principles; tho, wereI to diſtinguiſh myſelf as a Partiſan, I ſhould ſtilè myſelf an Electrical Philoſopher; for it is to Electrieity alone that I am indebted for that ſmall ſtock of Knowledge, which I have acquired in my Reſearches of Nature. (a) See my mrſt Principles in the Eſſays, Page 23. Anicle  the Fourth. p ſtio Lays, ase æ Boſore Before the late great Improvements that have been made in Electricity, I had no thoughts >em commencing PhiloſpherBecauſe thæ ooks that treated of Philoſophy, and undertook to explain it, were for the moſt part obſcure and perplexing, or elſe the Rules implied manifeſt Contradictions; for Example, if I had a Rule or Maxim laid down to obſerve that all matter was inert, having no Affections or Properties peculiar to it as matter, but was intirely inactive and dead; I ſhould have another, or perhaps two, that contradicted it; or which is the ſame thing, ſome of the moſt active properties were aſcribed to ĩt, ſuch ãs Attraction and Impulſe; i. e. Matter or Body in ſome Circumſtances was indued with a mutual Attraction, in others with a repelling Force, both which active Properties were ſeated in the Bodies themſelves. Another poſition was that where Attraction ends a repelling Force begins, with other arbitrary maxims, which never were, or can be proved or reconciled. r Moreover when I came to look into Sir Iſaac Newton's Principia, I had not read through his Preface, before I found that great Man himſelf complaining much of the many Ambiguities to be met with in Philoſophy. This, and the above mentioned Contradictions and Difficulties being laid together and conſidered, I muſt own I had no great Inclination to attempt what Sir Iſaac called the Search mathematical Studies; till of a ſudden, a flood of light broke in upon usby means of the aceidental Diſcovery of the Leyden Experiment, which cleared away the miſt, and effoctually convinced us that all matter was not, according to the received maxim, inactive; but that there were active particles likewiſe contained in it. We then alſo found that inſtead of an univerſal Vacuum or emptineſs throughout the whole ſyſtem of nature, which was before a firſt and fundamental Principle, we had the greateſt reaſon to believe the contrary, and that all Nature was replete with an elaſtic aẽrial Spirit, or elementary Fire; and that the want of that knowledge left an opening for all thoſe difficulties and contradictions above mentioned: There then began to dawn, as ĩt were, ſomewhat like an electrical, i. e. a rational Philoſophy. Inſtead of ſuch an inconceivable mutual Attraction ſeated in the Bodies themſelves to cauſe them to tend towards each other, that Phenomenon or tendency appæared to be the effect of the expanding force of the univerſal Fire Juſt then diſcovered; and inſtead of ſuch an unaccountable Attraction ſeated within the Bodies, the efficient cauſe of the gravitating tendency of themn appeared to be extraneous; i. e. a Cauſi behind or beyond the Bodies imptlling them and cauſing them to tend. li  A A etrtaln: Author obſerves,  That the ſpirit of Diſputing and an earneſt deſire. to obtain the Victory rather than come at the Truth has been one of the greateſt impediments to the improvement of nature Knowledge. And that nothing occaſions more wrangling, than when different Perſons annex different Ideas to the ſame Words; for Men can never rightly underſtand one anther till they mean the ſame things by the ſame Expreſſions. That no diſputes ariſe in pure Mathematics, becauſe the Definitions of the Terms are premiſed, and every Body that reads a Propoſition has the ſame Idea of every part of it” s SO that when any Man is ſo weak as to think to bring one Demonſtration in: oppoſition to another, he is to be diſregarded by ęvery one that would reaſon like a Philoſopher; for we may immediately put an end to all Mathematical Controverſies, by ſhewing either that our Adverſary has not ſtuck to his Deſinitions, or has not laid down true Premiſes, or elſe that he has drawn falſe Concluſions from the Principles he has laid down; or at leaſt we muſt own that we do not underſtand ſome part of his Demonſtration, and deſire him to explain it; for unleſ we can ſhew where the Error or Paralogiſm is, we muſt not condemn by the Lump, but acquieſce with him in what he has proved.” Tis Tis ifideed moſt certain that the neglecting to explain Terms has been the cauſe, not only of ſome of the greateſt and warmeſt Diſputes among Authors in general, but has alſo been productive of ſome of the worſt Effects; for had Terms been explained, it had been next to impoſſible, that ſuch palpable Contradictions ſhould ever have heen introduced into Science jtſelf, as they moſt evidently have, particularly thoſe of Attraction and Gravity. Were Tærms explained, no one would heſitate concerning thæe meaning of the word Attraction, or the drawing of one thing towards another; the ſame may be affirmd of the meaning of the word Gravity or Weight. But if any one, engagd in a Diſpute, were to take the Liberty of uſing the Terms promiſcuouſly, ſo as to mean either Drawing or Weighing, which he pleaſed, he by means of ſuch an Artifice would have it in his power to play ſo faſt and looſe, that there would he no arguing with him. : Electrical Philoſophers ſeem juſtly to wonder that ever it could enter intothe Minds of Men to interpret two words (which are ſo widely different in their Signification from each other, as thoſe of Gravity and Attraction manifeſtly are) ſo as to have any ſimilarity or likeneſs at all, and much deſs that they ſhould mean one and the ſame thing. Does not Dr. Friend àrgue much more conſiſtently, who afſirms, that Attraction is the uuity sa3 Gravity the Effect? Have Have not Gravity and Attraction the ſame relation to each other as any Effect and its Cauſe? With what Propriety then could they be deemed one and the ſame thing? Can it be thought any great matter of ſurprize, iſ a Philoſophy, thus circumſtanced, ſhould be embarraſſed with inſuperable difficulties and perplexities, as could never have happend, had Terms been previouſly explained? In a word—a neglect of explaining Terms ſeems to be one of the greateſt, if not the principal Reaſon of the many perplexities and ambiguities in the current Philoſophy, as it leſt room, at leaſt, for the introducing of various Inconſiſtencies. lili Dr. Derham, though allowd to be an undiſguiſed Author, ſeems to beſprak, as it were, the promiſcuous uſe of theſe two Terms in ſtead oſ one, although quite diſferent in their Senſe and Meaning. In his Aſtro-Theology Book 6. p. 137. he undertakes to ſhew the great Uſefulneſs of Attraction, but begins it with enquiring about Attraction or Gravity, as if both of them in conjunction had been allowd to be one and the ſame Principlee But ſurely, theſe are ſuch Liberties which can never be thought conſiſtent with ſound Reaſoning, Moſ certainly a Philolophy, embarraſſed with ſo remarkable Difficulties as to require the Aſſiſtance that ſuch miſerable Auxiliaries are capable of affording it, can never be founded on ratjonal and true Principles; and yet at the the ſame time boaſting of it as a Philoſophy that had already arrivd at the ſummit õf Perfection. - : llll How juſtly, I ſay, might we exclaim againſt a Philoſophy, which affirmed that all Matter was inert, and yet in the next Breath aſcribe to it the moſt active Properties, as Attraction in particular, although no Word can be more expreſſive of ĩts Senſe, or carry its own meaning along with ĩit to ſignify a Cauſe or active Principle plainer than that does; yet it is immediately turn'd into an Effect; and Gravity, Coheſion, Magnetiſm, &c. all of them into Caunſes; as when we ſay, Attraction of Gravity, Attraction of Cobeſion, Attraction of Magnetiſm, &c. &c. That Effects are frequently put in the place of Cauſes is notorious, and even Motion is oſten made uſe of to ſignify a Principle or Couſe. lll To prove this to be Fact, See p. 242 of the Eſſays, where you will meet with an extraordinary pompous Harangue on Motion, as a Caufe, by Dr. Stephenſon, Author of the mechanical Phyſician. I ſhall only cite a few Lines at the beginning of it, which may ſerve as a Specimen of the reſt.  Among ſecond Cauſes, Motion is the e principal immediate 4gent and Inſtrument  of all the Effects, Operations and Phenomena ef that are producd in the material Univerſe, e and is the primary Cauſe upon which the s Power, Force, and Energy of every Body, F 2 f or æ æ n- of Bodies whelly depenò, &æ. &cc a y B. How do electrieal Philoſophers avoid the like Abſurdities? A. There can be no other effectual way, than by explaining Terms with Preciſion, and having alway a ſtrict Regard to their Definitions, order to guard àgainſt either Miſtake or Deign. li B. Why do you afféct to make ſo many Quotations and Tranſcripts from other Authors? A. You miſtake, it is not Affectation: But as I never pretended to be learned myſelf, I am ſenſible that whatever I advance, be it ever ſo worthy of notice, will be but coldly receivd, and that merely on account of my want of what is called Learning: My Reaſon thereforę for a many Quotations is, that what I advance may have the ſanction of the more learned, particularly, when they are found to agree with and confirm my Reaſoning. This I ſull take for granted to be ſufficient to ſatisfy the judicious and candid Enquirer. j  ———————————————————————— B See Dr. Stephenſon's Aſſertion on Motion as a Cauſe, in Eſſays, Page 242.

By an Electrical Philoſopher, I mean, one who is become a Philoſopher, merely from the Knowledge acquird from electrical Experiments: And by electrical Philoſophy, I mean, a Philoſophy founded on electrical Principles. B. What are the Tenets, which are maintained by electrical Philoſophers? A.  That the Fr. me of Nature is a perfect  and well orderd Machine; or In othèr words,  that the viſũble Syſtem of the World was s created, e created, diſpoſed, and ſet into motion by rhe Finger of God; acts as a Machine does, a Connexion and Communication being preſervd between all the diſtant parts of it; for if the Contact of a Machine be interrupted, the Motion is deſtroyd in all thoſe parts from which the Communication is cut off. More particularly, ſuch Philoſophers aſſert, that the fluid ætherial Matter of the Heavens acts by Impulſe on the ſolid Matter of the Earth, is inſtrumental in every one of its Productions, and neceſſary to all the ſtated Phenomena of Nature. ll ss Hence they divide the Elements into ac-  tive and paſſive; not that they are ſuch by  any inherent or eſſential difference; but that s according to the Order eſtabliſhed by the  Divine Architect, they are obſerved to ſubſiſt  under theſe different Relations.” B. What Emoluments are electrical Philofophers poſſeſſed of beyond others, which they were Strangers to before? . Many, and very remarkable ones, ſome of which I ſhall mention, Slã Firſt, Fire in particular, which one ſhould naturally imagine to be one of the moſt familiar ſubjects, yet, before it was illuminated by Experiments made in Electricity, there are few things of any Conſequence of which we were much more ignorant. Before that time we Enew ſo little of the nature of Fire and Heat, that we imagined them to be one and the ſamę, EE : conc L] s L c La c L] c Lal c c c c LL c L] c conſequently, as we were certain that Heat could be generated and deſtroyed at pleaſure, it muſt have been a Contradiction to ſuppoſe that Fire was a permanent Principle. We had no Criterion, no infallible mark or diſtinguiſhing Characteriſtic to. point out to us that Fire was a more permanent Principle than IIeat, till Eloctricity taught us to make a proper Diſtinction between them. Secondly, Since Fire has been diſcoverd to be a permanent Principle, we are enabled to give a rational account of the Cauſe of Motion in the World, which is ſuch an Advantage we never before could arrive at. Thirdly, Before the grand Deſideratum was diſcoverd, we contented ourſelves, when treating of Gravitation for example, with ſaying, ſuch and ſuch things were effected by Gravity, not conſidering that Gravity itſelf was only the Effect, and that conſequently theſe things were brought about by the Cauſe of Gravity; this being the caſe, it could be no wonder if Philoſophy was in a very perplexd ſtate, eſpecially as ve ſo confounded Terms, particularly thoſe of Gravity and Attraction. We adopted Attraction as a firſt Principle, and when we had it, knew not what to make of it; for although we adopted it as a firſt and fundamental Principle, yet at other times we could allow it to be no more than a mere Phenomenon ſã. - ..4 n   (a) Dr. Samuel Clark undertook to vindicate Attraction vhen attack'd by Monſieur Leibnitæ and others, and repliedFHow- _——lial Lt ux um—-art — However this was not our fault, but rather our misſfortune, ſince it was owing to the imperfect ſtate Philoſophy was then in. VFourthly, Another Advantage which we poſſeſs beyond others is, that whereas none before the Diſcoveries that have been made by means of Electricity could poſſibly know any thing of the nature of Fire, nor hardly what was meant by the Term elementary Fire; Electricity has diſcoverd and verified elementary Fire itſelf, and that in ſo plain a manner, as even to realize it to the Senſes, and at the ſame time we are aſſurd it is in form of a moſt exquiſitely fine, pure Air or æther. While Men remained ſo entirely ignorant of Fire, as not to be able to know whether any ſuch Principle exiſted, it was impoſſible for them to know how to diſtinguiſh between Fire and Heat; they therefore concluded them to be the ſelf ſame thing, and finding, as before  -  It is very unreaſonable to call Attraction a miracle and  an unphiloſophical Term, after it has been ſo often ss diſtinctly declared that by that Term we do not mean to “ expreſs the Cauſe of Bodie: tending towards each other; but  burely the Efſfe& of this Cauſe, or the Phenomenon itſelf,  diſcoverd by experience, whatever be or be not the  Cauſe oſ it. Gravitation or Attraction in this Senſe (he  adds) is an actual Phenomenon of Naturè.? And again; : Philoſophers thereſore may ſearch aſter and diſcover that  Cauſe ĩf they can, be it Mechanical or not Mechani-  cal; but if they cannot diſcover the Cauſe, is thereforæ the Efſect itſelſ the Phenomenon, or the Matter of Fa&t  diſcovered by Experience (hich is all that is meant by At-  traction and Gravitation) ever the leſ” true? ] hinted, - hinted, that Heat could be generated and deſtroy'd at pleaſure, they for that reaſon thought it a ſure ſign that Fire was not a durable Principle any more than Heat; and what ſeem'd moſt remarkable, no one could be much moræ miſtaken than Sir Iſaac Newton himſelf, as was manifeſt from his aking if a red-hot Iron was not Fire? ; Fifthly, Before the Diſcovery of Fire as a rmanent Principle, we could never attempt to explain the Phenomena of Nature, otherwiſe than from firſt endeavouring to inveſtigate the Laws by which they acted. We now, with much greater readineſs, account not only for the Laws, but the Cauſe of ſuch Phenomena, conſequently our Reaſoning is now a priori. Fire, the grand Deſideratum, being diſcoverd, we can with equal Propriety proceed from the Cauſe to the Effest, which is ſuch an Advantage as was not attainable hefore. Sixtbly, Another Emolument, no leſs favourable and ſatisfactory than any of the reſt, is, that ſinge the diſcovery of an elementary Fire, a variety of the moſt abſtruſe Phenomena of Nature, which were unaccountable hefore, are renderd clear and intelligible, and à general mechanical Agency appears more and more conſpicuous. The Rev. Mr. Jones obſerves, that æ the Writings of our modern Reas ſoners, whether Metaphyſicians or Mathes maticians, are ſtored with Objections, not G s only  e only againſt the reality, but even the poſſis: bility of a mechanical Agency ſa) But however, the Light now reſlected on the Works of Nature in general has left much leſs room for ſuch Objections. To illuſtrate the Doctrine of a mechanical Agency, I ſhall quote a Paſſage out of the above-mentioned Book, which appears to put the reality of a general Mechaniſm paſt diſpute.  That God does, he ſays, in many ss Caſes, govern the World by material Agents, f and conſerve the Motion of Bodies by the s activity of ſecondary Cauſes is beyond diſ-  pute. The ſupport of animal Life by Breath;  the motion of a Ship before the Wind; of  the Sap in Vegetables at the approach of the  Sun's Light; o the Mercury in the Baro-  meter by the preſſure of the Air; of the Fluid in a Thermometer by the expanding  Power of Fire; of Bodies impell'd and driv-  en off again by the flux and reflux of elecs trical ther, with innumerable other Phenomena of Nature, all conſpire to eſtabliſh this plain Truth. And if it be an axiom in Phyſics, that more Cauſes are not emplòyd where fewer will ſuſfice, how comes it to paſs that thoſe Agents, which confeſſedly miniſter to ſo many and great Effects, are not ſufficient for the producing of all? Shall L c L] E] . L c L c c c L] c L] c -   la) See Mr. Jones's firſt Principles oſ Natural Philoſophy, Page i0. or ꝑ. à72, of the Eſſays. 6c we we allow that God governs the World by a ſubordinate agency and mechaniſm in ſome caſes, where that agency appears to us, and deny it in others, merely becauſe we have loſt ſight of it, or becauſe it would make againſt us? A Philoſophy, that labours under this difficulty, and. is one while working with a material Cauſe, and in the next breath with an immaterial one, be it ever ſo ingeniouſly put together, will after all be liable to this grand exception; at beſt, it is inconſiſtent and unworthy of God. Every Body muſt ſee and know, that there are material Cauſes acting in the World; and he that denies it muſt deny his Senſes. If theſe Cauſes are not ſufficient to perform all the ſtated Operations of Nature, then the Creator hath made uſe of ſuch means as are not proportionable to the end. If the Creator himſelf performs them by the immediate agency of his own Subſtance, then is there no need of any other Cauſes; they are all ſuperfluous. But that there are other Cauſes is abundantly evident; therefore they muſt be capable of anſwering their end, and every material Effect will be immediately owing to a material Cauſe. What I here ſay is grounded on this reaſonable Poſtulatum, if it may not rather be called an Axiom, that the Wiſdom of God is conſiſtent with itſelf in its Operations; and that he wants neither Power nor Skill to avoid the error of Inconſiſtency: Grant G 2  but te but this, and the Argument amounts to a 5 Demonſtration. See his firſt Principles, ꝑ. I ſhall here juſt mention a Paſſage from Lord Bacon's Works, taken notice of by the ſame Authorr See his firſt Principles, p 220.  where he remarks, that there is not, tin all the courſe of his Writings, ſo heavy a sc Cenſure, as that which he thought proper to t paſs on thoſe who denied an univerſal Me-  chaniſm of Nature, s Certain it is, ſays that renown'd Philoſopher) that God worketh nothing in nature,  but by sECOND CAUSES: And if they t would have it otherwiſe believed, it is mere  Impoſture, as it were, in favour towards God, s and nothing elſe, but to offer to the Author  of Truth, the unclean ſacrifice of a Lye B. Have you any thing more to obſerve in general relating to this new-fangled Syſtem of Philoſophy? . That we, who are Profeſſors of it, are become Converts merely upon Conviction; for when we firſt began to ſcrutinize and examine the current Philoſophy, and had conſiderd, that its firſt Principles were an univerſal Vacuum, and an Attraction, whereas the electrical ſluid being © extremely elaſtic and ſubtile, as to pervade all other Bodies, we naturally concluded, that inftead of ſuch a Vacuum, there muſt neceſſarily be un univerſal Plenum, ſince a ſluid ſo extremely elaſtic, and yet ſo extremely rare,  umt piumæ3Iſſæ ——i rare, could never be at reſt till all parts were equally full; and that conſequently hitherto we muſt have been wrong in almoſt every thing. We therefore judg'd it rational to make trial of a different Syſtem, and found it upon Principles diametrically oppoſite; this being put into execution ſucceeded according to our Expectations and Wiſhes, and I can with great pleaſure and truth aſſure you, that the more we purſue it, the more it ſeems ſtrengthened and confirmed; and although we have had ſome years trial of it, we never had the Ieaſt reaſon to alter our opinion concerning it. This gives us great encouragement to believe that we have luckily purſued the ſearch of nature, till we have diſcoverd true Science, flowing, as iĩt were, in its own native channel. What gives us the greateſt reaſon to preſume that our Philoſophy is now flowing in the true channel, jis, that our Experiments are ſeldom or never obſerv'd to clalh with one another when explaind on the above mention'd Principles, though ever ſo much varied and diverſified. Nor is it one of the leaſt advantages, that now a Man may become a very intelligible Philoſopher, without the aſſiſtance either of much mathematical Learning, or of any other Language than his own, conſequently the Knowledge of natural Philoſophy will now be a much eaſier Acquiſition than it ever was beforo. B. How came you to think of prefixing ſo humble a Motto to your Eſſays? æ.  A. Ihardly know why I prefix'd any, but only as a Motto is cuſtomary. However a principal reaſon why I made choice of one oſ that kind was to intimate, that I conſiderd my ſelf as no way poſſeſſed of any extraordinary natural Talents; yet, that I thought myſelf certain I had ſtumbled on a true method of philoſophizing, from the light we received from the diſcovery of electrical Fire, which Electricians of much ſuperior Parts and Learning had either heedleſly neglected, or elſe thought not worth their notice. Indeed, ever ſince the firſt Diſcovery of this wonderful Power of Nature, I have had as great a propenſity, as others have ſhewn an averſion, to cultivate an enquiry into its Nature, Office, and Uſe. VVWVhat a number of Experiments do we find in Dr. Prieſtley's copious Hiſtory of Electricity, and not one of thoſe Electricians make the leaſt enquiry concerning the Uſes for which it was ordaind: Thoſe they have made the ſubject of their enquiry appear merely trifling, when compard with thoſe relating to its Uſes. It was thought ſomewhat remarkable, that Dr. Prieſtley himſelf, who had peruſed ſo great a number of Authors on Electricity (as by his Catalogue we find he had) never once mentioned the Plan on which I proceed, notwithſtanding he inſerted my Eſſays in his Catalogue of Authors, juſt as if the ſpirit of philoſophizing, lately ſo predominant, had all on a ſudden vaniſhed agd forſaken Mankind. B. B. What then do you take to be the reaſon of that Difinclination which is ſiewn to an Enquiry, which in your Opinion promiſes the moſt important Diſcoveries? ſll A. I can think of none, unleſs it be, that this electrical Fire, appearing with a train of Tokens and Indications of Univerſality, ſhould diſconcert Philoſophers, by leaving no room for their adopted Vacuum; - otherwiſe it was natural to expect, that Dr. Prieſtley would have ſaid, whether my Enquiries into its Nature and Uſes, were approvd or diſapprovd ofB. I muſt further beg to be informd how to make a proper Diſtinction between the different kinds of Fire, as elementary Fire, ſolar Fire, the Fire of Lightning, of Electricity, of culinary and ſubterraneous Fire; and in what reſpect elementary Fire differs from the reſt? A. Electrical Philoſophers have but one kind of Fire, namely, the pure elementary Fire, the reſt being all different modifications of the ſame homogeneous Fire, acting in different Conditions and Forms. Tho ſolar Fire is doubtleſ of the ſame elementary kind; but we could not imagine there was any beſides ſo pure, till we were agreeably diſappointed by finding the electrical Fire to be ſuch, ſince that is ſo exceedingly pure, as, like the Rays of the Sun in the Focus of a burning Glaſs or concave Speculum, to yield neither Smoke, Aſhes, or other groſ feculent Matter. To ſuppoſe more kinds of Fire than one is deemd unphiloſophical, con- conſequently, even that which Dr. Prieſtley calls natural Eloctricity muſt he the ſame Fire in a diſferent dreſs: That I ſhall explain to you a litile farther on, and ſhall give you the Doctor's own Account, from the 2d.

All Bodies, and all Matter, ànd Particles of Matter, have both an attracting and a repelling Property inherent in the Bodies themlves; and where Attraction ends, a repelling Force begins. : > As for Attraction, I muſt eonfeſs, I can form no tolerable Conception of it, and much leſs, that the ſame matter ſhould both attract and repel, ſince two ſuch Principles in the ſame Body muſt deſtroy each other. Beſides, is it not an allowd maxim in Philoſophy, that matter is inert, having no Affections, Powers, or Properties? If then matter be inactive and dead, how came Philoſophers to contradict their own receivd Poſitions ſo far as to aſcribe active Properties to inactive matter? as Attraction, Repulſion, &c. Attraction of various kinds, as Attraction of Gravity, Attraction of Coheſion, Attraction of Magnetiſm, electric Attraction, &c. &c.The Sun attracts the Planets, and the Planets the Sun, and one another. By Attraction they account for the Tides, and moſt other diſficult Phenomema. I deſire therefore to know how theſe things are reconeiled ? B. Your Queſtions ſeem ſomewhat captious; ſorely you think to ſap the very foundation of the Newtonian Philoſophy; or at leaſt to give occaſion of great Difſenſions among Philoſophers. A. You never were more miſtaken in your Life; my ſole Intention is juſt the reverſe. Electrical Philoſophy is altogether pacific, and tends to unite Philoſophers, and to put an end lt H  to totheir halting between two ſuch differẽnt and contradictory Opinions, as that of an abſoIute Vacuum, and that of an univerſal Plenum of elementary Fire. To prove which of us is in the right, Iet us put the diſpute to the teſt, by enquiring, firſt, which appears the moſt rational Philoſophy, that which is founded on an univerſal Plenum, or one founded on an abſolute Vacuum; or in other words, whether the whole Syſtem of the Univerſe was created to be properly furniſhed, or to remain empty for ever. The Anſæer appears ſo obvious as ſcarce to admit of heſitation. Secondly, Which ſeems the moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the cauſe of Bodies tendĩng or gravitating towards each other is a mutual attracting force, ſeated in the Bodies themſelves, or whether the effect of an impelling extraneous force, the force of an univerſal elaſtic medium bhind or beyond the Bodies? How the latter may be perform d is obvious and clear enough to the Underſtanding of eve one; but noone can form any rational Idea of the former. Even the greateſt Votaries for the Doctrine of Attraction differ eſſentially themſelves about the manner how it is perform'd; nor eãn they even ſo much as agree, whether it be a Cauſe or an Effect, as the Rev. Mr. Jones has indiſputably provd, in Book æd. Chap. 2d. of his firſt Principles of Nat. Philoſophy. See a Quotation of the ſame in the 8th Chap. of the 3d. part of the Eſſays, p. 3 31. where it is diſcuſę'd at r large,  large, the whole of which I ſhall not at preſent trouble you with, but ſhall juſt give a brief ſummary, which Mr. Jones has drawn up; where he produces the ſeveral Authors giving their Verdict in their own Words.

But if theſe * learned Men, who are all vindicating the  ſelf ſame Principlęs of Philoſophy, had no s clear Ideas of what they affirm'd, and could  not underſtand one another,tis no wondœr  if the world ſhould be at ſome loſs to undet-  ſtand them.” B. V there never was in reality ſuch à thing as Attraction, how came ſuch a Principſe to bæ ſo generally receiv'd as it has been? A. Attraction in Philoſophy, like Epicycles in the ancient Aſtronomy, was a merę invention to ſolve appearances; nor had Attraction ever been thought of, could any other expedient have been found to ſupply its place; for even when it was adopted by them, it would by no means ſerve the purpoſe they deſigned, unleſe they were ſomotimes allow'd to call it Gravity; that is, though it was receiv'd as a Cauſe, it would not ſerve the turn, unleſ” it was alſ allowd, ſometimes to be explaind, as an Eg-ect. Is ( 54 ) Dialogue V. 7 rinnt 7ſ I z 55 - -& i a. ] 1Is it not ſtrange, as the Newtonians found themſelyes ſo ęmbarra'd æ&viſic infuperable difficulties relating to the Term Attractim, that at the diſcovery of the electrital fluid, æ Principle ſo powerſful and extenſivę as that appear}d to be, they never attempted to examine it, ſo far at leaſt, as to try whether it was not capable of affording them ſome aſſiſtance towards a truer Philoſophy than their own, or elſe to direct them to a Philoſophy, which was attended with fewer difficulties than that which they were in poſſeſſion of. It would be natural to expect after ſuch æ notable diſcovery of ſo ſurpriſing and powerful a force as the electrical Fire proves to be, that they would have ſet to work with one conſent, and cultivated the diſcovery, in order to enquire whether it would not afford ſufficient light, either to extricate them out of the inſuperable difficulties attending their Philoſophy, or ele aſſiſt them in directing them to ſome truer method of Philoſophy than what they had attain'd to before. Hilli 8B. I never heard of any very remerkable difficulties that attended the Newtonian Philoſophy, hut the reverſe; and that ĩt is gencerally allowd, by Men of the beſt Underſtanding, to be the only true Syſtem that ever appear'd in the World. 4. A. If Sir Iſaac Newton himſelf may be alIowd to be a competent judge, it is not a true Syſtem of Philoſophy, and for this reaſon, becauſc c æ uum=—"- i à ; it u—————a. . — — cauſe ĩt is attended with the greateſt difficulties. ——Had he bęen certain that Philoſophy was fixed on a firm baſis, he would never have publiſhed its difficulties to the World in the Preface to his Principia, where he informs us, whence difficulties in Philoſophy, in general, L] L) c c c - L La L] L - - L] L] La L L c cc . E ariſe.  All the difficulty of Philoſophy, he ſays, ſeems to conſiſt in this, from the Phenomena of motions to inveſtigate the Forces of nature; and then from theſe Forces to demonſtrate the other Phenomena; and to this end the general Propoſitions in the firſt and ſecond Books are directed. In the third Book we give an Example of this, in the explication of the Syſtem of the World. For by the Propoſitions mathematically demonſtrated in the two firſt Books, we there derive from the celeſtial Phenomena, the Forces of Gravity with which Bodies tend to the Sun and to the ſeveral Planets. Then from theſe Forces by other Propoſitions which are alſo mathematical, we deduce the motions of the Planets and Comets, the Moon and the Sea. s I wiſh we could derive the reſt of the Phec L] c c c L c Lal cc nomena of Nature, by the ſame kind of reaſoning from mechanical Principles. For I am induced, by many reaſons, to ſuſpect, that they may all depend upon certain Forces, by which the particles of Bodies, by ſome cauſes hitherto unknown, are mutually impelld towards each other, or are repelVd and 3li  recede . ll ſ =V b _i  a 5 axttur n y/u a t i ; v il 57 habń hlꝶ r O- T - it  V778  n -1r I AEVEI i I y It - /  r7  recede from ẽãch other; which forces beſng  unknown, Philoſophers have hitherto at-  tempted the ſearch of nature in vain. But s I hope the Principles here Iaid down will  afford, ſome light, either to that or ſome truer method of Philoſophy. Of this Complaint of Sir Iſaac, concerning the. difficulties attending the ſearch of nature, i. e. of natural Philoſophy, Ihave taken notice beforę, in my Eſſays, p. 14I. to ſhew how Philoſophy was embarraſſed before the diſcovery of a Medium more ſubtile and elaſtic than common Air. It is clear heyond all doubt, that an attentive Reader of Sir Iſaac's Writings will find, that he fluctuated between two different and contrary Opinions; viæ. that of an univerſal Vacuum, and that of an univerſal Plenum; his Principia inclining to the former, and ſeveral of his Queries to the latter. In the ſecond Advertiſement of the third Edition of his Optics, he informs us, that to ſnew he did not take Gravity for an eſſential Property of Bodies, he had added a Queſtion concerning its cauſe, which he ſuppoſes to be a ſubtile ætherial Medium, readily pervading all Bodies expanded through all the Heavens cauſing the Gravity of thoſe great Bodies ſ the Comets, Planets, &c.) towards one another, and of their parts towards their, Bodiesand ſuch as may ſuffice to impel Bodies from the denſer part of the Medium towards   towãrds the rarer, with all that power which we call Gravity. Optics, Query 18, 19, 206, 2x ſa).. l This the Rev. Mr. Jones has taken notice of before; p. 75 of his firſt Principles of natural Philoſophy. EEES Any one might reaſonably fuppoſe, that the thought of a ſubtile Medium in the pores of all Bodies; was almoſt always uppermoſt in Sir Iſaac's Mind, even while he was Writing his Principia, fince he concludes it with informing us, that  now be might add ſomething concerning s q certain moſt ſubtile Spirit, which pervades  und lies hid in all groſs Bodies; by the force  and action of which Spirit, the Particles of s Bodies mutually attract one anotber at near  diſtances, &c. &c. ſb). But, pray inform me ingenuouſly, why you ſuppoſe ſuch a Vacuum and an univerſal emptineſs throughout luxuriant Nature? BE. For many Reaſons, but particularly on account of the regular and unretarded motions of the Planets, both primary and ſecondary, in their ſeveral Orbits; ſince, notwithſtanding they have a compound motion, their periodical Revolutions are always performed in exactly the ſame ſpace of time, which muſt be a proof that they move in a Space where there is no Medium of any kind to diſturb, obſtruct or retard their Motions. (a) Eſſays, . 348(6) DBeſides, an univerſal Vacuum is abſolutely neceſſary to conſerve that conſtant and undecaying motion which we obſerve among the planetary Bodies; for be the elaſtic Medium ever ſo rare and fine, it muſt reſiſt in ſome degree, which in Iength of time would become ſenſible; whereas the motions of the Planets have continued the ſame, without the leaſt alteration, ever ſince the ſirſt commencement of Aſtronomy, conſequently, there muſt neceſſarily be a Vacuum, by which means, and the force of a mutual Attraction, a gravitating tendency of Bodies towards each other is accounted for in a rational and ſatisfactory manner. What confirms the truth of theſe things, ſo as to put them paſt diſpute is, that they are demonſtrably provd by Sir Iſaac Newton's mathematical Reaſoning in his Principia: Had he not been fully perſuaded of the truth and certainty of a celeſtial Vacuum, can it be reaſonable to ſuppoſe, he would ever have undertaken and executed fuch a work as his Principia ? Vhat indefatigable Pains, as well as fixed Reſolution, muſt it require to go through ſuch à number of laborious Calculations, in order to obtain the many uſeful Theorems contained therein ? And, as was ohſervd above, what muſt neceſſarily prove the truth of the Opinion is, that the general Phenomena, which are obſerved to prevail throughout Nature, are ſolved by theſe two Principles, vię. thoſe of an univerſal Vacuum and a mutual Attraction of BoL dies, l dies, even to a mathematical Demonſtration. Is not this Conſideration alone a ſufficient proof of the truth of the Aſſertion? Al. By no means: For as the Rev. Mr. Jones very juſtly obſerves on the ſame, Tis equal  to the Mathematician, whether his firſt Principles are only imaginary and hypothetical, or whether they are real; the Operation will  go on as ſmoothly, and the Concluſion come s out as readily in the one caſe as in the other;  and if hypothetical and real Forces will  ęqually afford matter for an Aſtronomer to  work upon, we may appeal to the judge-  ment of any ingenuous Man, ſufficiently  verſed in mathematical Studies, whether the  Phenomena above mentioned, i. e. whether  a mutual gravitating tendency of Bodies to-  wards each other may not ariſe from a preſ-  ſure behind as well as ſrom an attraction  hefore, and whether Sir Iſaac's geometrical Reaſoning will not be as nlams in the  one caſe as in the other ſœ].” p. 92. of his Nat Philoſophy; or at p. 369. ſect. 156 of the Eſſays.

A. æ% ERE it may not be unneceſſary to obPA H N ſerve again, firſt, that matter according Nxæ to all Philoſophers is inactive and quite motionleſs, having no Affections, dvalities, or Properties peculiar to itſelf, but is entirely paſſive. Secondly, that ſince the World appears replete or full, as it were, of motion, it muſt neceſſarily proceed from ſome active Principle or Cauſe. But, it ſeems, no active Principle was known beyond that of the common Air or Atmoſphere, till another much more active was happily diſcovered by means 2 of      of the electrical Apparatus; and:in ſorm of fire, that allowd active Principle and cauſe of motion, which Fire, on the ſtricteſt: examination, is found to be the ſelf ſame with that of Lightning ſa); and by what appears from the niceſt Obſervations is every where diſperſed.

But excluſive of our Phyſico-mechanical Experiments, there are others of a more phyſical Nature, which point out a motion of the æthereal Matter where it -is ſeldom obſerd, although it be inceſſantly deſcending from the upper Regions, and paſſing through ſuch ſron Bars, as are particularly deſcribed in the Eſſays, p: 78. 406. and 421.

DB. What is the Law ithat is obſerv'd by falling Bodies, for I have almoſt forgotten it? A. Firſt, their Acceleration is, as the increaſe of the times or moments taken up from the beginning of their fall, in an arithmetical Progreſſion of the moſt ſimple ſeries, viz. o, 1, 2, 3: 4, &c. whoſe exceſs and common difference is one, and for that Reaſon their Squares increaſ? acording to the odd, ſiĩ. e. 'the uneven Numbers, I, 3, 5,7, &c. See the Eſſays, p. 406. Secondly, Bodies. are obſervũ to deſcend about the Space of 16 feet in the firſt Second of Time from the beęginning of their fall; therefore ſince ſixteen feet and an half is one perch or pole and 320 poles is one mile, T ſhall call 76 feet a Pole, and then 330 f thoſe poles will alſo be one mile. The above mentioned Numbers and the Acceleration of falling Bodies will be more eaſily underſtood if committed to Writing, as in the following Tablet.  Seconds. The ſirſt of the three Columns in the Margin exhibit the Seconds of Time. The next Column are the Squares of thoſe Seconds. The third Column contain the Differences of the Square Numbers. The Sum of thoſe Differences or odd Numbers, I, 3: 5, 7, &c. counting upwards, are always the Square of the Number of Seconds from the beginning of the Fall. 3 EXAMPL E. firſt is 4.= the Square of ⸗. firſt is 9 = the ſquare of 3. firſt is 16 = the ſquare of 4. firſt is 25= the ſquare oſ5. eſt, be there ever ſo many. conciſe, and ſo very eaſy to  in which a falling Body will deſcribe deſcribe any given Diſtance, excited my Curioſity to enquife; how long time a Body would require to deſcend to the Centre of the Earth, which Diſtance in round Numbers may be called 4000 Miles. S OL UT ION. Since the number of Poles or Perches contain'd in one Mile is 330 ſuch Poles, viz. Poles of 16 Feet, conſequently the number contain'd in 4000 Miles is 1320000 poles, the Square Root of which ĩis I148,9  the number of Seconds which the deſcending Body would require to arrive at the Earth's Centre, ſuppoſing it paſſed through a free and open ſpace; i. e = about 19 minutes. Here then are two things worthy of notice: Firſt, that although in the firſt Second of time its deſcent would be no more tham one pole, yet ſo violent is the Impetus or Cauſe of the Accelerations, that in the laſt Second of time, its deſcent at the ſame rate, would be no leſ than 2295 of ſuch poles i. e. almoſt 7 Miles. Secondly, that the ſame cauſe prevails at every particular point of the Earth's ſurface, ſince Bodies deſcend with equal celerity and freedom from every individual part of it, conſequently the cauſe of Gravity is general. What a Violence this, which like an impetuous torrent thus purſues the deſcending Body  How unſike is it to the greateſt Force lill that that. can bæ employd by human Art; ſince all other forces are conſtantly diminiſhing as ſoon as begum,, whereas the accelerations of falling Bodies towards the Centre of the Earth, is always increaſing according to the Square of the times from the beginning of the falll This natural tendency of all Bodies towards the Centre of the Earth, at every point of the ſurface, furniſhes us, not only with the cauſe of Gravity in general, but with the moſt remarkable deception, with reſpect to the cauſe of the Gravity of our own Bodies; which, altho we have all the certainty that is poſſfible, from Reaſon and Experience, as well as from falling Bodies 10 convince us, that the cauſe of our gravitating tendency towards the centre is an exterior preſſure; yet that preſſure operates ſo naturally, ſo conſtantly, ſ0 regularly and ſo imperceptibly on every part and particle of our Bodies, that it appears o us to be a real internal Weight, juſt as if it were inherent, and ſeated within us. This Deception is ſo remarkably prevalent, and the Senſe is ſo deluded, that we cannot poſſibly overcome the fallacy. Since then we are ſure to err and be miſguided by the evidence of Senſe, the only ſure method to conduct us to truth is, to conſult the more unerring teſtimony of our Reaſon, which aſſures us, even to a demonſtration, that the Cauſe is external. B. Of what real Advantage can the inveſtigation of this Deception be to Philoſophers? A. Unleſs we were previouſly appuſed of uch   ſuch à Deception, we ſiould bè unãble to ex5lain te Dõctritie of the Antipodes in à raHondl and ſatisfactory manner,.. B. HoW ãces the diſcovery of that deception enãble Perſons to explaiũ it? A- By informing them, that ſo long às they cãrn ſtand of ſit upright, ſo long the Earth appears beneath them; and thus the doctrine of the Antipodes is eaſily and naturally explained thereby. Electrical Philoſophers therefore, and aſt others, may now very juſtly admire, that the cauſe of Gravity was not known before. From the conſideration of falling Bodiẽs Wwe are furniſhed with à variety of uſeſul hints, ànd many Concluſions may be ſafely deduced from ſHem. lll lil Firſi, That àlthough the figure of the Earthi is à Sphere or Ball, yet Bodies have the ſame inclination or propenſity to deſcend towards the Centre from every individual part of it; this ĩs àn undoubted proof that thè Cauſe or accelerating Force is genera. ll Secondly, From theſe Conſiderãations it as evidently follows, that it is an exterior Forcè or powẽtful Preſſure, inceſſantly impelling the deſcending Body towards the Centre. Hente, the Earth neceſſarily, às it were, puts L on that ſ Th Form. l   Thirdly, The dotrine of the Antipodes will alſo be illuſtrated by conſidering the Phenothèia of faling Bodies. And ãs àll Bodiès have rE qThird octri a 68) Dialogue VI. a natural tendency towards the Centre of the Earth from every part of the ſurface, this conſideration will ſerve to leſſen what is held by many as one of the greateſt Paradoxes in Nature, namely, that every individual point of æ Sphere or Globe ſhould appear uppermoſt to the Inhabitants, where-ever ſituated. This Paradox is likewiſe ſolved by conſidering, that Bodies appear, when viewd, according as the Retina of the Eye is poſited; for if we view an Object with the Eye inverted, the Object, for that reaſon, appears inverted; or if a Picture, &c. be ſet bottom upwards; and viewd with the Eye inverted, the Picture then appears erect, conſequently, ſo long as we ſtand or ſit upright (the lower part of the Retina being then neareſt to the Earth) ſo long the Earth will appear beneath us, ſince according to the poſition of the Eye, ſo Objects neceſſarily appear. . Fourthly, From the premiſes ariſeth, perhaps, as great a Paradox as the former, which is this; were we to ſuppoſe a perſoration quite through the Globe of the Earth, and that ſpace were free and clear from a reſiſting Medium, in the ſpace of 19 minutes a falling Body would arrive at the Centre of it, viz. 4000 Miles, nearly; at which place it would meet with ſuch a reſiſtance, as it had overcome but juſt before, which, though check'd in its career, muſt ſtill continue ĩts rectilinear or right-lid courſe, would, after it had paſſed the Centre, be, as it were, were, moving upwards, conſequently ſtill more and more retarded, till it arrivd at the Antipodes, at which time the motion would be ſpent and quite at an end; after which, it would begin again to deſcend towards the Centre as at firſt, and the whole proceſs be repeated: Thus it would continue to vibrate as a real Pendulum, whoſe point of ſuſpenſion was the Centre of the Earth, and the utmoſt extent of its Oſcillation at parts of the ſurface diametrically oppoſite, that is, at thoſe parts of the Earth, where the Inhabitants were Antipodes to each other. ILLUSTRATI ON. It is well known to every Aſtronomer, that by reaſon of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, all Inhabitants at the Equator, who are Antipodes to each other, neceſſarily change places every 12 hours; that part of the Heavens which is the Zenith to the one, is 12 hours after the Zenith to the other. Amongſt a variety of Indications that appear to point out an univerſal Plenum, the moſt promiſing ont is, that of falling Bodies; for from thence we are furniſ'd with ſufficient Data to proceed in many other Enquiries: By the aſſiſtance of that Phenomenon, the Univerſality of the ſubtile Fluid is clearly and rationally pointed out, as likewiſe, that it is exceedingly elaſtic, and acts by preſſure on the Earth, and all plaK 2 netary 7) Dialogue VI. netary Bodies. diayrLnm VFrom the above Conſideration of fuch an univerſal exterior preſſure on every part of the Earth, electrical Philoſophers ſometimes takę the liberty to query, whether the cauſe of ſuch an univerſal preſſure had any ſhare in the firſt formation of ihe Earth; ſince, jif it had not -t firſt been ſo uniform, but of any multiform figure, ſuch a violent univerſal preſſure woulꝗ neceſſarily cauſe it to put on the globular form in which it now appears; Or had ãll the aſſemblage of the parts and particles of matter of which the Earth is compoſed been ever ſo wide aſunder at the firſt, ſuch an univerſal preſſure would naturally cloſe the parts, ànd cauſę them to unite in a Sphere: However, ſuch a violent reſſure on all parts of the Earth as is exhibited b that truly phyſical Experiment, is abundantly ſufficient to account for the conſervation of the ſpherical Figure, if not the Cauſe of its putting on that form at the firſt. The Doctrine of the Antipodes ſeem'd a downright contradiction to the Ancients, and their Conceptions concerning ſuch Inhabitants were ſimilar to what might be reaſonably expected from Children. Dr. Hakewell, in his Declaration of the Power and Providence of God in the Government of the World, Book 3d. chãp. ꝗ. p. 248. when ſpeaing of the Ignorance of the Ancients relating to their Coſmography, ſays,  that which  t0o me feemeth more ſtrange is, that thoſe l 5 two x& ũ  - —— —— .  ut two learned Clerks, Lactantius, and Auguſtine, ſnould with that earmeſtneſs deny the Being of any Antipodes. Their Words 4re worth the noting, thereby to ſee their confidence and cagerneſs in the maintenance of ſo evident a miſtake. Lactantius ſaith, What ſhall we think of thoſe who give onut there are Antipodes, that walk oppoſite to us ? Do they ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe; or is there any ſo blockiſh as to believe there are Men whoſe feet are higher than their heads; or that thoſe things there hang, which, with us, lie upon the ground; and that Plants and Trees ſpring downwards; that the Snow, Rain, and Hail fall upwards upon the Earth; 21d need any Man to marvel that hanging Gardens are accounted among the ſeven Wonders of the World, ſince Philoſophers have made hoth Fields and Seas, Cities and Mountains all hanging? actantius is here ſeconded by Auguſtine, who ith, e Their Fable of Antipodes, Men dwelling on the oppoſite part of the Eqrth, where the Sun riſes when it ſets to us, having their Feet oppoſite to ours, is a matter altogether incredible, and by no means to be believd.” s Zachary, Biſhop of Rome, and Boniface, Biſhop of Mentæ, led ſas it were) by the Authority of theſe Fathers, went farther herein, condemning one Virgilius, Biſhop of Saltæburg, as an heretic, only for holding that there vwere Antipodes. But Time and Travel (ſeith : Dr.  Dr. Hakewell] have diſcoverd the contrary  ſo evidently, that we may as well doubt of  the being of a Sun in the Firmament, as of  the experimental clearneſs of this Truth.” B. What other general Concluſions do electrical Philoſophers draw from the doctrine of falling Bodies? A. That there is an univerſal and a violent preſſure on the ſurface of the Earth.That the preſſure muſt neceſſarily be univerſal, ſince Bodies fall with equal freedom from every part of the ſurface, conſequently the ſame cauſe is every where preſent, and will neceſſarily produce the ſame Effect. This, therefore, they conclude to be the phyſical Cauſe of the mutual gravitating tendency of all Bodies towards each other, and towards the Centre of the Earth. B. According to this Doctrine, all things that have hitherto been accounted for by Attraction, you attribute to preſſure or to pulſion; but I am perſuaded you will find yourſelf miſtaken, particularly, in one thing that Iſhall mention, which is, the Doctrine of the Tides, or the flux and reflux of the Waters of the Sea, particularly the former, which ſurely can never be accounted for by an univerſal preſſure: It would ſeem very ſtrange indeed, if an univerſal preſſure on the ſurface of the Sea ſould cauſe ĩit to riſe in Tides. A. I have ſo throughly conſidered and examined the doctrine oſ falling Bodies, and an ] univerſal univerſal preſſure on the ſurface of the Earth, that I can venture to ſay, if there is any one thing which was uſually attributed to Attraction that cannot now be more rationally accounted for by means of an univerſal preſſure, I ſhall think that one thing alone ſufficient to overthrow the doctrine, which I have adopted of an univerſal Plenum throughout the mundane Syſtem, and will readily give it up. As for the doctrine of the Tides, I muſt own, I never conſiderd them ſo far as to attempt a Theory of them; however, were I to undertake jit, I am perſuaded, I could account for them by means of an univerſal preſſure or pulſion, in a much more rational and ſatisfactory manner than ever it was poſſible to be done by Attraction. B. Methinks I ſhould be glad of your further explanation of your Sentiments upon this ſubject. A. In order thereto, I muſt premiſe two things by way of Lemma. Firſt, the univerſality of Ether, or ſubtile Medium. Secondly, that the Tides are influenced by the preſence of the Moon. Firſt, As to the Univerſality of æther, it appears ſufficiently evident from what has been ſaid above on the doctrine of falling Bodies. Secondly, As to the general appearance of the Tides or riſing of the Ocean being influenced by the Moon, that is too well known to be diſputed.

DIALOGUE. VII. Fundamental Principles7That the fixd Stars are Suns in the Centres of ſo many Solar Syſtems The grand Objection anſvered, or rather the fallacious Queſtion to prove a Vacuum refuted by means of an eaſy Experiment. F undamental Principles. B. 8&x04 H AT are the firſt and fundaà v  mental Principles of Electrical & Philoſophy? v/3iz A. Firſt, That the whole Syſtem of Nature is replete with ætherial or pure elementary Fire, iĩ. e. the ſame pure Fire which we have diſcovered by means of the electrical Apparatus, and which ĩis ſo exceedingly pure, that, like the ſolar Fire in the Focus of a Burning Glaſs or concave Speculum, it yields neither ſmoke, aſhes, nor any other groſ feculent matter. L Secondly, Secondly, That this univerſal elaſtic Fire acts by impuiſe on all other bodies, and ĩs the ſole cauſe of their centripetal tendency towards the Sun, and of all terreſtrial bodics towards the Earth. il Chirdly, That the Elements are in ſtrictneſs no more than two, viz. Fire, and groſs Matter, the one active, and the other paſſive. Fourthly, That the fixed Stars are Suns, in the Centres of ©o many ſolar Syſtems, each of them encompaſſed with their revolving Planets, rimary and ſecondary, like our own. Fifthly, That the Operations of Nature are perform'd mechanically, i. e. by means of material br ſecondary Cauſes. li Sixthly, That the pure, primary Air, æther, or fluid Matter of the Heavens is indefinitely rare and indefinitely elaſtic, according to Sir Iſaac Newtons Definition in his Optics Quer. 2I. Seventhly, That it is univerſal and expanded through all the Heavens Quer. 188. Eighthly, That this univerſal Principle exiſts not only in all open ſpaces, but in all the minuteſt pores and vacuities of the moſt denſe and compacted Bodies. B. What Authority have you for ſuch Plurality of ſolar Syſtems; has it not ſomething of a romantic appearancel? . So far from it, that the doctrine of ſuch a plurality of folar Syſtems is univerſally receivd by modern Aſtronomers, and ſeems to have the beſt pretenſions to truth. The   The ingenious Dr. Derham, in his AſtroTheology, Book 2d. chap. æd. obſerves,  that s from the parity and conſtant uniformity ob-  ſervable in all God's Works, we have great  Reaſon to conclude, that every fixt Star hatli ss a Syſtem of Planets as well as the Sun. For  jt is certain, that the Sun is a fixt Star to the  fixt Stars, as they are to the Sun. And in this  caſe, iſ, (as the juſtly renown'd Mr. Chriſtian Huygens argues) ſa) we ſuld imagine ourſelves to be placed ſomewhere in the heavenly Regions, as far from the Sun as from the fixt Stars, e sſhould then perceive no difference between the one and the other. For it would be very unlitely, that we ſbould ſee any of the ſolar Planets, either by reaſon of the diminiſbing of their light, or becauſe their Orbs would ſink into the ſame lucid point vith that of the Sun. Being then ſo placed, we ſhould imagine all theſe Stars ſboth Sun and fsixt Stars] to be much òf the ſame nature and hind ; and from a view of any one of them nearer to us than the reſt, we ſbould make our judgement of them all. And now being, ſuith he, by ihe Favour of God, admitted ſo near one of them, namely, the Sun, as to ſee ſix leſſer Globes revolting round about him, and other ſeccondary ones revolving round ſome of them; why ought we not to have the ſame judgement of the reſt of thoſe Suns as of this, and thint it altogether probable, that this is not the only Star, of all the a) See his Coſmotheorus. L æ num- mber that is encompaſled with ſuch a train, in any reſpect excels the reſt ? Neither alſo at this Star alone revolves round its own axis, t rather, that all the reſt have suineuhat of e ſame hind alſo.  And ſo that learned Perſon goes on in further purſuit of this ingenious Argument.”  Beſides thoſe ſtrong probabilities, we have this farther to recommend thoſe imaginations to us, that this account of the Univerſe is far more magnificent, worthy of, and becoming the Infinite Creator than any other of the narrower Schemes. For here we have the Works of the Creation; not confid to the more ſcanty Limits of the Orb, or Arch of the fixt Stars, or even the larger Space of the primum mobile, which the Ancients fancied were the utmoſt Bounds of the Univerſe) but they are extended to far larger, as well as more probable, even an indefinite Space. Alſo in this proſpect of the Creation, as the Earth is diſcarded from being the Centre of the Univerſe, ſo neither do we make the Uſes and Offices of all the glorious Bodies of the Univerſe to center therein; nay in Man alone, according to the old vulgar opinion, that all things were made for Man. But in this our Scheme, we have a far more extenſive, grand, and noble view of God's Works, a far greater number of them; not thoſe alone that former Ages ſaw, but multitudes of others that the Teleſcope has diſcover'd  ſince; ſince; and æll theſe far more orderly placed through the Heavens, and at more due and agreeable diſtances, and made to ſerve to much more noble and proper ends; for here we have not one Syſtem of Sun and Planets alone, and one only habitable Globe; but myriads of Syſtems, and more of habitable Worlds, and ſome even in our own ſolar Syſtem, as well as thoſe of fixt Stars. And conſequently, if in the Sun and ĩts Planets, although viewd here upon Earth at a great diſtance, we find enough to entertain our Eye, to captivate our Underſtanding, to excite our Admiration and Praiſes of the Infinite Creator and Contriver of them: What an augmentation of theſe Glories ſhall we find in great multitudes of them, and in all thoſe Syſtems of the fixt Stars through the Univerſe, that I have ſpoken of/ ll  Book 6th. chap. iſt. After taking notice of the ſpherical Figure of the Earth and of Gravity,” he ſaith,  leaving all conjectural matters, let us come to a more evident benefit of Gravity, and that is, the natural tendency of all Bodies to the Centre of the Globe; this is very manifeſt in our own Globe. For whatſoever the Decays are among earthly things; however their Forms are changed; yet their matter remains entire, and returns again to ĩts grand Parent the Earth, and adds, an admirable Proviſion Gravity is ſor the perpetuity of the Globe,  and  and to continue the ſtate and hahitability p. throughout all Ages, which would  òtherwiſe waſte or decay, or run into the  moſt irreparable and pernicious Diſotders. The ſame Author proceeds in his 2d. Chap. t6 ſew the great Benefit aſforded by Gravity againſt the centrifugal Force of the ſeveral Parts of the Planets.  Upon a ſuppoſition,” he ſays, That every one of the Globes revolves round its Axis, we ſhall find beſides  the Benefits already ſpecified, another very  great uſe of Gravity, to the good, yea, to  the very Exiſtence of our own and other  Globes, and that is, the preſervation of their  integrity againſt the centrifugal Force of their  Revolution or diurnal Motion.  Por without ſuch a band as Gravity to e keep their Parts together, the whirling about  of thoſe Globes would ſhatter them in pieces  and diſſipate them abroad into the circum-  ambient Space. Thus muſt it needs befal our  own Globe, which whirls about at the rate  of above 1000 Miles an hour, and is com-  poſed of Earth and Water, materials of much  too looſe a texture to prevent the diſſipation  which the centrifugal Force of ſuch a rota-  tion muſt neceſſarily occaſion ahout the  equatorial parts; a rotation that would as  eaſily throw off the parts of the Earth, eſpe-  gially the Waters, as the whirling round of a Wheel or Globe would the looſe duſt lodg'd s npon it, -5a  n L] L cc A i . 28L81) u A little farther on he takes noticè of the  centrifugal Force of the planet Jupiter, which  by means of its extraordinary bulk, and 5 performing its rotation on ĩts Axis in leſ  than ten Hours, is, as he ſays at the rate of  28159 Miles an hour at its Equator, and therefore in imminent danger of being whirſd  in pieces by ſo rapid a Motion, were not its  parts kept cloſe together by ſuch a band as  Gravityn., &s This Gravity of Bodies is obſerv'd manls feſtly to decreaſe in proportion of the ſquare  of their diſtances reciprocally, that is, at  twice their diſtance, the Force is but õne  fourth of what it was at a ſingle diſtance;  and but a ninth at thrice their diſtance; &c.” Dr. Derham's Aſtro-Theology, p. 100. Ed. ꝗ. Mr. Harvey, in his Contemplations on the Starry Heãàvens, after treating of the Sun, adds,  This Sun, with all its attendant Planets is  but a very little part of the grand Machine  of the Univerſe. Every Star, though in ape pearance no bigger than the Diamond that  glitters on a Ladys Ring, is really a vaſt  Globe, like the Sun in ſize and in glory;  no leſs ſpacious, no leſs luminous than the  radiant ſource of our Day. 86 that every tar is not barẽly à World, but the Centre  of a magnificent Syſtem, has a retinuè of  Worlds irradiated by its Beams, and revolv-  ing round its attractive Inſluence. All which  are loſt to our Sight in immeaſurable Wilds cc of L L   of iher.That the Stars appear like ſo many diminutive and ſcarce diſtinguiſhable  Points, is owing to their immenſe and incongeivable diſtance. Immenſe and inconceivable indeed ſince a Ball ſhot from the loaded Cannon and flying with un-abated rapidity muſt travel, at this impetuous rate, s almoſt ſeven hundred thouſand Years before  Iit could reach the neareſt of thoſe twinkling sc Luminaries. B. This is moſt wonderful indeed But ſurely the receivd Maxim of Philoſophers is contradicted thereby, viz. that the Works of Nature in every individual part, like the moſt perfect mechanical Machine, mutually aſſiſt, and are ſubſervient to each other, which in this Caſe ſeems incredible; for of what uſe can ſuch an infinite Number of Solar Syſtems be to each other, or to us, when the neareſt of them is at ſuch an immenſe diſtance? A. By means of a plurality of Solar Syſtems is afforded ſuch a rational method to account for the material Cauſe of Gravity in the celeſtial Regions as was never known, nor perhaps, ever thought of before; yet this muſt be allowd, unleſs a more rational and ſatisfactory method can be thought of than that of my Theory of the Nature and Office of the Sun; ſince according to that, the centripetal or gravitating tendency of the heavenly Bodies is accounted for in a rational and natural manner, particularly at p. 237. of the Eſſays. li 5 uli B. I ſhould be exceedingly well pleaſed with a Recapitulation of that Theory; for indeed to ſay the Truth I have forgotten it. A. I ſnhall think no Recapitulation troubleſome that can contribute towards your Improvement; and the rather, becauſe it will be neceſſary in the preſent Caſe to obtain a clear Idea of our Sun and Syſtem before the Nature and Office of the reſt of them can be pointed out; but of that Recapitulation farther on when I come to treat of the Cauſe of Gravity in general. B. Of all theſe fundamental Principles, none is ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſed as the very firſt, that of an univerſal Plenum. If ſuch a Principle be but mention'q, it is ſure to be rejected as fabulous. The maintainers of the eſtabliſhed Philoſophy affirm, that were there not an univerſal Vacuum, there could be no ſuch thing as Motion; for ſuppoſing an univerſal Plenum, inſtead of an undecaying motion of the Planetary Bodies, it muſt be abſolutely impoſſible for them to move at all, unleſs two Bodies could exiſt in one and the ſame identical ſpace, which is allowed to be the greateſt Abſurdity. A. In Anſwer to this grand Objection, I ſhall cite a Paſſage from that celebrated Writer, the Rev. Mr. Jones, frequently mentioned in my Eſſays, who having in the 4th chap. of the 1ſt Book, p. 29. of his Eſſay on the firſt Principles of Natural Philoſophy, been treating of M the ( 84) Dialogue VII. the vis inertiæ, proceeds in the former part of his 5th chap. p. 39. in the following manner.  Thus much, I think, may ſuffice to ſhew, that the celebrated Demonſtration of a Vacuum has ſet out wrong. It will be as eaſy to prove, even waving all that has been ſaid  on the vis inertiæ, that it has concluded  wrong; if the relation between a moving body and a reſiſting medium be rightly underſtood.” « When a Pendulum is made to ſwing in Air, Water, oo Mercury, the reſiſtance it meets with is greater, as the medium is denſer: and as a Plenum of Ather, ſuch as the mechanical Philoſophy requires, would be more denſe than any other Fluid, its Reſiſtance, they ſay, muſt be greater: no Motion could poſſibly continue in it. But then as motion is obſerved to continue in the Heavens, without any ſenſible Diminution, there can be no Reſiſtance in the heavenly Spaces, and conſequently no matter of ſufficient denſity to occaſion it. s This was Sir Iſanc Newton's way of computing Reſiſtances, and the uſe he made of them when computedl. That we may ſee whether this Doctrine agrees with Experience, let us ſuppoſe a Ship, with iĩts Sails ſpread, to be in motion before the Wind; every Body muſt allow me, that if the Wind were to keep its direction, and the Ship to  have an open Sea, it would go quite round  the Globe; and for the ſame Reaſon that it s makes La c c L] L c L c L. c - c c L] c LL c L c L.] c LL L.] c - c L] t s L] E c s makes one Revolution, it would make another, and ſo on ad infinitunm. Are we to ſay, that the Air, in which it moves, is an unreſiſiing Medium?2 We ought to ſay this, if the Demonſtration above-mentioned really ĩs what it pretends to be. But the truth is, a Medium may, in its nature, be a reſiſtin one, and yet in fact give no ſuch Reſiſtance, as ſhall be any Impediment to a Body moving in it. For let any Perſon tell me, how much Reſiſtance the Ship receives from the Air in this caſe? The Anſwer muſt be, leſs than none: the Reſiſtance here ĩs a negative quantity; and the Ship is ſo far from loſing its Motion, that it is continually receiving it, as it paſſes through the Air; yet it would be falſe to affirm of Air in general, that it is not a reſiſting Medium. As to the ater the Ship ſails upon, this being not the cauſe of its motion, will ſerve to retard it; but as the continued impulſe'of the Air behind, is ſuperior to the ſum of all the following Reſiſtances, 1ſt, of the Air before, 2dly, of the Water the Ship ſails upon, and 3dly, of the Cauſe of Gravity which is continually acting upon it; the motion will continue notwithſtanding theſe Impediments.  Were it to be laid down as a general rule from this particular inſtance, that Water reſiſts Motion, but Air does not; neither will this coincide with Experience. A Cork, or any other light Body, thrown upon the M 2 s ſtream   sn su——; ſtream of a ſluice or floodgate, will be carried off with it; and as it is common for a conſiderable part of the Water to return again upon the ſtream in a curve, if it be obſtructed by the banks, and have but a narrow outlet, the Cork may come about with it, and compleat its Revolutions, ſo long as the cauſe continues to act upon it. The Water gives no more Reſiſtance in this caſe, than the Air did in the other: and thus it will happen univerſally, that every fluid, where it is the Cauſe of Motion, will not be found in that caſe to give any Reſiſtance, be its quantity of matter great or ſmall.”  We are now prepared to return to the Pendulum. If it vibrates in Air, the Air will retard its motion; and there is a good reaſon why it ſhould do ſo, for Air is not the Cauſe of its Motion. If in Water, neither is that the cauſe of its motion; and it will give a greater Reſiſtance to it in proportion to its quantity of matter, that is, in proportion to the action of Gravity upon it. If in Ruickſiltuer, it will meet with a ſtill greater Reſiſtance, for the ſame reaſons. But if there be any elementary ther, acting as the natural Cauſe of Gravity in Bodies; it is juſt as abſurd, to ſearch for the Reſiſtance of ſuch a fluid, from the motion of a falling Body; as for that of the Air, from the motion of. a Ship that ſails by it; or for that of Water, from the motion of bodies carried  down _r/m  Iuu ——— —m——— - “ down by a current of it.If one Philoſopher may conclude, that Gravity cannot be owing to any material fluid, becauſe he has found, that this fluid does not ræſiſt a gravitating Body; may not another demonſtrate with equal truth, that a Ship cannot ſail by the action of the Air upon it, becauſe he finds, from the niceſt obſervations, that the Air does not deprive it of its Motion ?  Leſt the Reader ſhould have ſuſpected me of a deſign to prejudice him beforehand, and to inject ſcruples through a want of better Arguments; I did not obſerve at the beginning of this diſquiſition, that Sir Iſaac had drawn two oppoſite Concluſions from a capital Experiment, relating to the affair now before us, but it will be proper juſt to mention it in this place. Having cauſed an empty wooden Box to vibrate as a Pendulum, he loaded the ſame Box with 77 times its own weight of metal; and in this latter caſe found the motion to be retarded more than it ought to have been by the Theory. In two different Editions of his Philoſophy, he imputes this to two different cauſes, without thè leaſt hint or apology to his Readers for ſuch an important change in his Opinion. In that of 1687 he accounts for this, from an increaſe in the Reſiſtance of the Air, occaſioned by a ſwifter motion in the heavier Pendulum; and has demonſtrated elſewhere, that the Reſiſtance of a Fluid to a Body ll s moving moving in it, muſt increaſe in a duplicate ratio * of the bodys velocity; but this conſideration hath no plage here. In that of 1726, he imputes this ſame effect, without any repetition of the Experiment, to the reſiſtance of a ſubtile medium againſt the ſolid parts of the incloſed metal; and mentions not a word about the Reſiſtance of the Air. But herein, it ſeems, he corrected his Philoſophy not for the better, it being abſurd, that the reſiſtance, of a ſubtil æther ſhould be diſcovered in ſuch a caſe as this.  This great Man ſeems to have laid it down as the foundation of theſe conjectures (for Ihope they are not both Demonſirations) that an Experiment, which requires machinery, can be performed abſolutely without Friction; the contrary to which is well known to every Mechanic. It is reaſonable to think therefore that the Friction between the hook and ring, on which his Pendulum ſwung, muſt have been ſomewhat increaſed, when the Ball was loaded with a weight 77 times greater; and the difference he found, was no greater than might ariſe from ſuch an Impediment, though the Inſtrument were  æ  The Reſiſtance a Body meets with from a Medium, s as the Velocity oſ the Body, and the Space of the Melium paſſed through by it, multiplied into each other. But that Space will always be as the Velocity; therefore he Reſiſtance is, as the Velocity multiplied into itſels, »n hat is, as the Square of the Velocity,  Ee u & SiaE.s uu i2s ————— ever ſo perfect. It is hard to ſay, how a Man of Genius, as he certainly was, could throw a plain Experiment into two ſuch different Shapes, neither of which are agreeable to Reaſon. Perhaps he thought it would ſuit better with the Principles he was endeavouring to eſtabliſh, not altogether to deny the exiſtence of a ſubtil ther, as he did at firſt, for that would have been too. much; but rather to enſure his Philoſophy, and keep this æther from breaking in upon his Syſtem, by imputing to it a degree of Reſiſtance. Whether the learned will conſider of theſe things, I cannot pretend to judge; in time perhaps they may : but for a while, I preſume, he that ventures to interpoſe, muſt be content to let the reproach fall upon himſelf. There was a time when Men had given up their Underſtandings to the Logic of the Schools + and the Quirks of Ariſtotle; and woe was  +  I will give a Specimen of their manner pertinent to the Subject we are upon. It is a logical demonpration of a Vacuum, extracted from Lib. 4. c. 6. of Ariſtotles Phyſics. If there be no Vacuum, there can be no Loco-motion. or æ ſpace already full cannot receive any thing into it; if it did, there would be two Bodies in the ſame place; which is an abſurdity. Some of his Commentators put it thus probatur aſſumptio; quia corpus quod locum mutat, vel inani ſpatio excipitur, vel pleno: ſi inani, habetur propoſitum: ſi pleno, ſequitur duo corpora ſeſe permeare The aſſumption is thus proved; becauſe a Body that changes its place, is received either into a ſpace Full of matter, or into one that is Empty : If into an empty ſpace, the point is proved; if into a full ſpace, then it follows that to Bodies muſt penetrate one another's dimenfions. And Ariftotle tells us of one Melisſus, an antient c to  ( 90) Dialogue VII. tothe Man, who dared to publiſh a ſuſpicion againſt them. That faſhion is now exploded, and we are all enſlaved to the pretences of a mathematic Certainty. But if the Doctrine of a Vacuum is really weak and without foundation, this faſhion will have its period like the former, and we ſhall be reſtored again to the enjoyment of our philoſophical Rights and Liberties.” Thus you ſee how evon many ingenious and arned Men delude themſelves by embracing 1e miſtaken and fallacious Arguments of others ithout examining them.  ſophiſt, vho being reduced to the laſt extremity hy the Force of this miſerable argument and determined not to admit a Vacuum, denied the reality of motion, and held the Univerſe to be immoveable. Had this Philoſopher truſted to Experiments inſtead of Logic, he might ſave ſilenced his adverſaries with very little trouble. For if a Bullet be put into a Bottle quite full of Water, and cloſe ſtopt down, we have a ſpace filled with an incompreſfible Fluid; which conſtitutes as good a Plenum as need be deſired; yet upon inverting the Bottle, we find the Bullet can move from the Top to the Bottom, or from one ſide to the other, as freely as if the Bottle were empty. Does 7t move into an empty ſpace, or into a full one? Why truly, into neither; for the Bullet and the Fluid change places with one another, ſo that the Motion is not hindred, thongh the ſpace is always ſull of Matter. Dialogue æa5ær æ æ E?E DIALOGUE.

FX3 H AT am I next to oonſider? E A. One thing more ſeems neceſ& ucu ſary to be known by every electriREMꝶ h Philoſopher in orr to render Experiments more plain and intelligible, which is, that in a variety of Experiments, there are effects that ſeem as widely different From what are obſerv'd in common, as ĩf they proceeded from two different Agents; probably, the effects are different Phonomena produc'd by the ſame Agent, acting in different forms; ſinoœ they ſeem not independent of each other, but co-exiſtent: the one part appears from the æffects to be much more ſubtile and active than the other: the one ſeems incapable of penetrating a glaſs body while replete with Air; the other pervades it at the ſamæe time with the greateſt freedom, actin on ſmall bodies within ſide of the glaſs as ĩ nothing were between them: the more ſubtile active part called Pneuma, or Spiritof ther, is an iil N uap BllE  5= (92) Dialogue VIIi. appellation, borrowed from the renowned Lord Bacon, as you will find in the 6th chap. of my Eſſays, where that great Author treats at large of Spirits and Pneumaticalss. In that and the chap. following are many Experiments which illuſtrate and confirm the reality of ſuch an acive Pneuma, or Spirit; the knowledge of which is another valuable guiding clue, not only to the ſolution of many electrical Experiments, but to other abſtruſe Phenomena of Nature, which are otherwiſe inexplicable; and therefore well worthy of our Inveſtigation. Many Elecricians from Obſervations and Appearances of the like nature have been of Opinion, that there were really two different and diſtinct electrical fluids, as appears from Dr. Prieſtleys Hiſtory s Jt had hitherto” he ſays,  been univerſally ſuppoſed, that all  the Phenomena of Electricity were produced  by the action of one electrical fluidl. Mr. Du Fay however imagined he had diſcovered another electrical fluid diſtinct from that of Glaſs, and peculiar to that of Reſin, &c. and thought that it was quite independent of the othęr, and that their operations were never combin' d. Mr. Symmer exhibits a variety of curious Experiments, relating to the ſame ſubject, and infers from them the probable exiſtence of two electrical fluids; not independent, but always co-exiſtent and counteracting one another. The Abbè Nollet ſeems not to be of the Qpinion that two ſuch ZſEthers exiſt; but main| tains  tãitis to contrary currents of the ſame fluid continued, and (to uſe his own Terms) concludes that a simultaneous effluence and affluence of a fluid matter, extremely subtile, conſtitutes Electricity : ls not the Opinion of two different ſubtile Mediums or æthers like ſtraying too wide from ſimple Nature, and conſequently too unphiloſophical to be admitted? Does not ſuch an univerſal ſubtile Ather as we have juſt diſeoverd ſeem abundantly ſufficient to ſolve the Phenomena, particularly when we conſider it as endued with various affections, qualities, and properties, acting in different capãcities, con⸗æ ditions and forms? This Doctrine is likewiſe agreeable to Sir Iſaac Newton's firſt Rule of Reaſoning in Philoſophy, viZ. We muſt admit no more Cauſes of natural things than what are true and ſufficient to explain their Appearances; Nature being pleaſed with ſimplicity, and affecis not the Pomp of ſuperfiuous bant I ſay, do not two ſuch univerſal ſubtile Mediums look too much unlike ſimple Nature to be admitted? Is it not more rational to ſuppoſe, that what are thought to be effects of another electrical fluid, are produced, by ſo many appendants, as it were, and in fact nothing more than as before obſerv'd, the ſame Agent acting in different capacities, different forms and modes, and in different circumſtances?]VWhat we term poſitive and negative Electrieity is by no means a ſufficient proof of N 2 two two electrical luids, they ſeem only different modes of the ſame univerſal Agent.. 8B. I cannot ſay I am very ell acquainted with the Term negative Electricity: I ſhould therefore be glad to be better informd concerning it. A. To render it as plain and obvi ious as poſſible. I ſhall be here obliged, for more reaſons than one, to tranſcribe the greateſt part of the 11th chap. of my Eſſays, part the 1ſt; where you will find the manner that the Saſb- -pane, and the Glaſs Receiver or Leyden Phial are charg'd; which will help to convey an Idea of what is meant by negative Electricity; and is as follows. s Firſt, Let A, and B, repreſent two Perſons, and let A be electrified on the Reſin-cake, while B is only on the floor.  Secondly, Let a Saſh- pane properly gitded on both ſides be held between them with its plane i in a perpendicular poſition, and the edge of it towards each Perſon, that ſo the two ſides of the Pane may the more eaſly be view'd at once.  Thirdly, If each Perſon approach a different furface of the Pane with a Finger at nearly equal diſtances, when they are about half an inch from the ſurface, a ſpark vill dart from the Finger of each to the Glaſs. This is performd ſo inſtantaneouſly, as to appear as one ſingle ſpark, i. e. from the ęꝗlectriſed finger of A through the thin Glaſs to the unelectriſed finger  finger of B; but the effect ſnęws the contrary: For were that the caſe, the Pane would not be affected thereby, whereas a few of thoſe o rations charge it. It will as plainly appear hat the Phial is charged the ſame way. For if a Phial be ſet on an electric Cake, and A and B approach it with their fingers, the one near the Cork-wire, and the other near the coating, when they are at the proper diſtance, ſparks vill dart from each finger at the ſame inſtant, and the Phial will be charged as the Pane was before  But what is moſt remarkable is, that though it be found neceſſary to electriſe bothſides of the Pane or Phial before it will produce the deſired effect; yet if both ſides are dlectriſed from the Machine, or from ruo different Machines, it is of no more effect than if only one ſide of it were electriſed.”  The moſt commodious way of. managing the Phial is to take itin the hand, for by that means the Experiments will be more eaſily made, and the Effects more viſible, than when it hangs on the prime Conductor, and conſequently may be explained in a more eaſy and familiar manner; for A being electriſed, his hand which holds the Phial is, with regard to the Phial, the prime Conductor, not only when he holds it by the Cork-wire, and by that means electriſes the inſide; but if inſtead of that he holds it by the coating, that only will be electriſed. Firſt then, if he take it by i the ( 96& Dialogue VIII. the Cork-wire, it will be in the ſame ſituation as the gilded Saſh-pane was, when A laid a finger on one ſide only, that is, ſince he will not be convulſed by bringing his other hand to the coating; but ĩf he remove that hand from the coating, and B on the floor Iay on his hand or finger on the coating, it will ſoon be ſufficiently charged; for if after that A lay his finger to it again, he will then be ſiockd as uſual. The ſame effect will follow, if inſtead of holding the Phial by the wire, he take it by the coating, and hold it ever ſo long in his hand, the coating only will be electriſed; for if after at hæ bring his finger to the wire, he feels nothing; but if B, ſtanding on the floor, lay on his finger, the Phial is then very ſoon compleatly charged. For if A put his finger toĩt again, he is then convulſed. So that in either caſe, the Phial according to Dr. Franklin, was electriſed plus and minus, i. e. firſt, when A held it by the Cork-wire, the inſide was electriſed plus, and the coating minus; and ſecondly, when he graſped it by the coating, that was electriſed plus, and the inſide minus, or in a ſtate of want: In either caſe the Phial could never be chargã, till the other ſurface of it was furniſh'd from the hand of B on the floorr-  In like manner if B on the floor takes the Phial into his hand, either by the Cork-wire or by the eoating, the ſame effects wHl follow: If by the coating, the inſide will be electriſed 1ſ A lay a finger on the wire; for after this B vill  ry l " 140 V9”/ vill receive the ſock, if he bring his other hand to the wire; and the ſame effect will hè produced, if inſtead of his holding it by ihe coating, he ſhould hold it by the wire; for then A electriſes the coating by laying his finger on thato. li lE c Hence the ſimilarity of the Phial, and ilded Saſh-pane; from either of which, a Phenomenon is exhibited, which perhaps wãs hardly thought of before, namely, that when the glaſs Receiver is properly charged, one ſide of it is actually electriſed immediately from the Earth, thro the Chain or other non-electrical Body communicating with it. Is not this a plain Intimation that the electrical fluĩd, which is produced from the Earth is in a negative ſtate, ſinoę that is the ſtate of the coating of a charg'd Phial, viz. that ſide of it which communicates with the Earth at the time of charging it, whether it be the inſide or the outſide.” Hence it may be ſafely concluded, that the Electricity, as it is called, i. e. the æther, which is obtaind immediately from the earth or floor ĩs in a negative ſtate, which may very probably be the natural cauſe of the Thunderclouds being for the moſt part in ſuch a ſtate, as Dr. Frantlin obſerv'd them to be: The i12th and I3th Letters of his 2d Edition contain a particular account of Electricity, by Experiments made with his iron rod from the top of his Houſe; in moſt of which it was in  a negative ſtate; ſometimes indeed, though but ſeldom, it was for a ſmall time in a poſitive ſtatee. Thæ Dr. advances what ſeems very rational at p. 119. viZ. why the Lightning may be expected to be in a negative ſtate, viz.  When æ a portion of Water he ſays, æ is in its æ common denſe ſtate, it will hold no more s electrical Fire than it has. When the  ſame portion of Water is rarefied into va-  pour and forms a cloud, it is then capable  of receiving and abſorbing a much greater i- quantity; there is room for each particle to. s have an electric atmoſphere. siThus Water in its rarefied ſtate, or in the s: form of a Cloud, will be in a negative ſtate  of electricity; it will have leſ than its nas tual quantity, that is, leſę than it is naturally 1 capable of attracting and abſorbing in that a ſtate. The manntr how the Shock the Leyden Experiment is generated and propagated. i Having carefully advanced thus far, on what tis preſumed will be allowed to be ſufficient evidence; ſince there is nothing either ſtraind, fictitious, or arbitrary; no other Properties or Qualities having been aſcribed to this ther tinam what are plainly diſcoverã in it, moſt of which un nit;.ul i — which were fortetold by Sir Iſaac Newton many Years ago; particularly, firſt, that it is much lite Air in all reſpects, but ſfar more ſubtile. See his Letter to Mr. Boylee Secondly, that it lies hid in the pores of all groſi Bodies in the manner foretold in the laſt paragraph of his Principia : And almoſt all Experiments are on his fide and Ioudly proclaim the ſame Properties, which are ſo obvious, that whoever is converſant with them, or will but take the leaſt trouble to inform himſelf, can neither miſs finding ſuch a fluid to exiſt in the pores of Bodies, nor after he has pumped it out ſa) with the electrical Machine, can he eaſily be ignorant of its inherent Rarity and Elaſticity. I ſhall endeavour next to inveſtigate the means by which that inconceivable violence is generated in the Leyden Experiment by the ſame cautious method. In order to perform ſo difficult a taſk, which has hitherto baffted every attempt, I ſhall here collect ſome poſitions, which have been already proved, and try how far they are capable of aſſiſting me in the arduous Undertaking. Fb That the conſtituent parte of Ather, contained in Bodies, conſiſt of all degrees of rarity, or rather all degrees of purity, agreeable to the nature of it, as deſcribed by Sir Iſaat  B ſa) We Linow ſays Dr. Franklin, that the electrical Fluid is in common matter, becaue we can ꝓump it out by the Globe or Tube. See the æd. Edit. of his Letters, ꝑ. 53: O Newton Newton in his. forementioned Letter to Mr. Boyle. Sã ccona, That the moſt pure, rare, and ſubtile rt of it, is alſo the moſt elaſtic and active ; and that this rule holds equally true in all the intermediate gradations from the moſt pure æthereal part, down to the groſſeſt common Air. llil Thirdly, That the ſubtile sEther contained in the pores of the moſt perfect non-electrical Bodies is looſe, free, and fluid, as in Metals, Water, Animals, and green Vegetables, eſpecially in the two former; and in various caſes, it is found, from the ſtricteſt obſervations, to move freely out, provided it be for an equal quantity of the ſame fluid to ſucceed it. Vourthly, That in all degrees of Attrition, a proportionate degree of Expanſion is exerted, at Jeaſt to a certain height; and ſince the homogeneous particles mutually repel each other, and conſequently the maſſes compofſed of them, the expanſive force therefore of the pure Air or æ£ther is ſo much ſuperior to the expanſive force of the common Air, that the limits occupicd by a maſi or aſemblage of the former, ſuch as the accumulations on Bodies when electriſed, muſt conſequently, by being ſo much more elaſtic than the latter, buoy it up, that is, repel and bear it away from the Body on which the æther is accumulated: By this means the equilibrium is deſtroyed, and in the ſame proportion as the rarity of the ſEther within thoſe- limits limits exceeds that of the common Aĩr, which ſurrounds it; and conſequently that thoſe rare limits may be confiderd as ſimilãr to a temporary Vacuum with reſpect to the Air, eſpecially ſince the effects of almoſt all electrical Experiments verify the facts, and therefore juſtify the concluſion. lli i Fifthy, That the Ather is firmly fixed in all the parts of Amber, Glaſs, Reſin, Wax, and all other Bodies, term'd original Electrics. See Sect. 204. ESE Sixthly, That when thoſe ſubtile particles are irritated by attrition or friction ofany kind (which is the caſe when the Glaſs is rubbed, ſince by being fixed in all parts of the Glaſs it is incapable of eſcaping from the Inſtrument of friction) we can always obſerve from the effects of every ſuch Experiment, that the Equilibrium of the adjacent Air is deſtroyd, and that the forementioned Pneuma or Spirit is inceſſantly paſſing into ſuch rarefied limits from all the ſurrounding parts and by that means impel light Bodies into them ſà). -4. A ſmall Attrition of the Glaſs or a piece of good Amber is ſufficient to produce thoſe ef-  (a) From the effects of the Experiments, thoſe Limits appear to be the moſt rare and elaſtic of all, at the very ſurface of the electriſed Body, whether it be the rubbd Glaſs, or whether it be any other thing electriſed; and that from the ſurface of the electriſed Body to the extremity of thoſe Limits, ſuch rarity and elaſticity gradually decreaſe; the included Ather becoming more and more groſ, from the Body on which it is accumulated. lEE O 2 fects, ſicts, as uppears from Mr. Boyle's Experiment vith a picce of amber when only laid in the Sun, or even a Glaſs warmed by the fire, which by that means became electrical. See Vol. I. p. 400. of Mr. Boyles Works, abridged by Mr. Sha. li LIf then ſo inconſiderable an Attrition as the Sun's Beams ſtriking on the furface of thoſe Bodies where the Ether is fix'd, be yet ſuſficient to cauſe ſuch an emanation, or as he terms it, effluvia emitted by the Glaſs, we have the leſs room to admire, if the ſame emanation be extended to a much greater diſtance from the Glaſs when the ther at the furface of ĩt is jrritated by violent friction. But the effects of thoſe efluvia or emanations extended from the fixd æther in the Glaſs, are not only viſible on the rubbd ſide of the Glaſs, but extend themſelves quite through it, if it be not too thick; for if a pane of Glaſs be held over light Bodies and rubbd, the equilibrium is deſtroyed on the under ſurface, as is found by the effect, thoſœ light Bodies being impelled towards it in the ſame manner as to the rubbd ſide: When the friction at the ſurface of the Glaſs ceaſes, the ſame elaſtic and rare emanation ſoon ſhrinks back again to the Origin from whence it came. 8BSeventhly, Attrition on the ſurface of Glaſ was the only way that was known of electriſying it, till another was accidentally diſcovered 16 Profeſſor Muſchenbroe, viz. that of confininhg trios, and then electriſing one of. them by ſuffering it to communicate with the excited Apparatus, where the effcts are vory remarkable; for no ſooner is the prime Conductor, &: electriſed, but that ſurface of the Glaſs which communicates with it is electriſed alſo, at vhich time the ſubtileſt and moſt elaſtic part inſtantly petvades the thin Glaſs, and therę impels, buoys up, or bears off the common Air, and rare Limits are formd on that ſurface likewiſe, as we find by the effects; and light bodies are as forcibly impell'd to that ſurface as to the other. And to that moſt rarefied ſurface the Spirit or Pneuma ſets in from the Earth, thro' denſe non-electrics ſo freely, that the Glaſs ſoon becomes ſuſficiently charged; that is, It is then what Dr. Franklin calls  electriſed in the cc common way.  When a Bottle,” he ſays,  is charged in the common way, its inſide and outſide ſurfaces ſtand ready, the one to give fire by the hook, the other to receive it by the coating; the one is full and ready to throw out, the other empty and extremely hungry; yet as, the firſt will not give out, unleſs the other can at the ſame inſtant receive in; ſo neither will the latter receive in, unleſs the firſt can at the ſame inſtant give out. When both can  he done at once,tis effected with incon-  ceivable quickneſs and violence. Or in other words, the inſide furniture of the Phial having a property of retaining the ther obtained l S obtained from the Machine, that ſurſace is, according to Dr. Erautlin, electriſed poſitively on account of its being there more ſtrongly retaind than by any other means; and the coating ĩs for the ſame reaſon electriſed negatively in as high a degree, which ſurface he terms extremely hungry: When theſe two ſurfaces are in this ſtate, and a non-electrical Circuit compleated from the one to the other, the Equilibrium is inſtantly reſtored at both, and with inconceivable violence. The plenum at the one ſurface electriſed by the Machine eſcapes into the vacuum at the other, i. e. the redundancy on one is diſchargd on the other, which the Dr. terms ſo extremely hungry, and thus the equilibrium is inſtantly reſtored at both, thro the non-electric Circuit, with the utmoſt violence, whether it be long or ſhort, regular or iregular, or with ever ſo many turnings and windings. The ſudden and violent ſhock is propagated throughout the non-electric Circuit by means ofthe continuity of the particles of the ther contain'd in it, from one end to the other; and notwithſtanding the irregularity of the Circuit, yet the contaid æther is movd in a ſimilar manner. and with the ſame freedom as every part of the Circumference of a ſolid Circle or Wheelis conceivd to be moved, were ſuch Wheel to be turned on its Axis; for otherwiſe it would be difficult to imagine how a motion could be communicated to every part of the largeſt Circuit poſſible, as inſtantaneouſly as to the ſmalle*tDialogue mating Obſervations ones ſelf and o tzqting them on truſi.

Mambrinos Helmet. 3tt  A.r xxn Very reſpectable young Gentleman xAa -; of my acquaintance in a neighſæ a bouring County, having lately returned from his Travels, wrote to me, and among other things informd me, that he had been taught Philoſophy by many diIferent Maſters, each of whom had adopted a favourite Theory of his own; and added. Iam become quite a Sceptic in matters of Opinion, and even frequently in deductions from Facts. This, it muſt be allowd, is a moſt ſtrange Confeſſion, and ſhews him to be gotten into the very track which muſt neceſſarily conduct him to that bane of all Science, Scepticiſm, viæ thãt of being taught Philoſophy by a multiplicity of Maſters, each of whom hãæd adopted a favourite Theory of his oomém. B. Do you think Scepticiſm to be a natural Conſequence of being taught Philoſophy by different Maſters. A. It muſt ſeem naturally to tend to it when each of thoſe Maſters had adopted a particular favourite Theory of his own. When my Friend was initiated into the Principles of the Theory of his firſt Maſter, no doubt but he might be well pleaſed with them, and by that time he had digeſted thoſe Principles, pernaps he might imagine they were not to be reſuted; but having enliſted under another Maſter, who had adopted a different Theory, he was foon unhingd, as it were, with regard to the Principles of his firſt, and having attentively conſidered thoſe Principles of his ſecond Maſter, he might by that time very poſſibly imagine himſelf capable of inſtructing his former Maſter, thinking he was then arrived at the higheſt pitch of Knowledge; but he ſoon became convineed of his miſtake by his third Maſter, who had adopted a different Theory from the reſt. Thus by going from Maſter to Maſter, and ſtill finding, that cach one had adopted different Principles, he at length became quite a Sceptic, as he himſelf owns, inſomuch as frequently to doubt even the evidence of his Senſes, or what he ſtiles deductions from Facts. I muſt own, I could not but reflect with a kind of complacency on the remarkable difference between that young Gentleman’s manner of being initiated into the ſeàrch of Nature, and that of my own, and the different Effects produced thereby.He, who was ight   Philoſophy by different Maſters, became qtiite a Sceptic; whereas, I had no guide beſides the dictates of Reaſon to conduct me, and the manner whereby the effects of electrical Experiments are reconciled with one another. He alſo added in the ſame Letter, that he had peruſed my Philoſophical Eſſays with great pleature; tho (he ſaid) he continued to think, that my extenſive Application of the electrical Power was by no means founded on ſufficient Experiments; yet, that it was with great pleaſure, he ſaw new facts daily ariſing in confirmation of it. And ſays, though I cannot conſider you as a Philofopher who has proved the point, I muſt look upon you as a Prophet who has foretold it. l When I had thoughts of writing a Supplement to thoſe Eſſays, I wrote to him again (and to many others of my Acquaintance) to deſire them to favour me with what Objections they thought any particular parts of them were liable to: my Reaſons for deſiring it I have given farther o...... VFrom my Friend's preſent Anſwer I have great reaſon to conclude, that his paſſion for epticifm has not abated ſince his firſt Epiſtle. He obliged me indeed ſo far as to ſend me many objections to what I had advanced; but in fo curſory, captious, ſneering, and ludicrous a manner; that if he had not profeſſed himſelf to be upon principle, a philoſophical Infidel, I fhould have thought myſelf ill-uſed by him. P Tho The firſt thing he objected to was what I had tranſcribed out of Biſhop Berkleys Siris, and from Profeſſor Boerbaave, concerning the vivifying Spirit in Air; to which, all the reply he makes is vivifying Spirit not demonſtrat-  ed.” The Gentleman objecting againſt the vivifying ſpirit in air, becauſe he thought it not ſufficiently demonſtrated, brought to my mind an Experiment of M. Haukſbee, made on Fiſhes; which, as it ſeems a full Proof of what he thought were not ſufficiently demonſtrated, I ſhall take the liberty to inſert it in the Author's own words, See Mr. Haulſbee's Phyſico-mechanical Experiments, exp. 16th. ꝑ. 304. e The Fiſhes made uſe of in the following Experiments were Gudgeons, which are a  ſort of Fiſh very briſk and lively in the Water, and will live a pretty conſiderable time  out of it. Three of them I put into a glaſe  veſſel to about three pints of common water (which Fiſnes were to be a ſtandard to com-  pare the others by). Into another glaſ5, to a like quantity of water, I put three more of them, which quantity of water juſt filled this glaſs to the very brim; upon which I ſcrew'd down a braſs Plate with a leãther between, to prevent a communication with the water in the glaſs and the externat-Air: And that it might the better reſemblè a Pond of Water frozen over, (on which account this Experiment was made) I ſufferd  as cc llE.] x L c - - - L - -- - - --a L L  & lit'e Aĩr as poſſible to remain on the ſur-  face of the included Water.  es The third glaſs had a likequantity of Water put intoit as the former; which Water,  firſt by boiling, then by continuing it a whole s night in vacuo on the Air-pump, was purg'd  of its Air to the greateſt nicety ſa): Into s this water alſo, I put a like number of Gudt. geons as into the other. Thus (the Fiſhes  being all put into their reſpective Receivers)  I applied myſelf to wait the event, which  was as follows: It was about half an hour  after ten in the morning when I began the  Experiments; and in about half an hour s from that time, IT obſervd the Fiſhes in the sexhauſted Water, or Water purgſd of its Air,  Ibegan to diſcover ſome uneaſineſs, by a more ssthan ordinary motion in their Mouths and  Gills, or Reſpiration, if I may call it ſo, difsfering from the Fiſhes in the other Glaſſes; o the included Fiſhes at the ſame time diſco-   (a)y From Experiments made with the electrical appara-  tus it never appeared that the Fluid in the Pores of Bodies  could ever be taken away or removed b any means,  otherwiſe than for an equal quantity of the ſame to ſupply  jts place, conſequently there is no ſuch thing as purging  the Water of it in the manner Mr. Haukſbee ſuppoſed.  Tt was morally impoſſible for him to have the ſame Reas ſons to believe that Fluid to be an elaſtic Fire as we find it is; and that not the leaſt portion of it can quit its place  but for an equal quantity of the ſame homogeneous Fire,  ſo that it was no wonder that the Fiſhes breathed nearly sa⸗ free in the Water, as though it had never been boiled  nor under the Air-pump, particularly aſter they had been  in ĩt ſome ſmall Time. j iili P 2 s vering vering no alteration; only I took notice that they would now and then aſcend to the top of the water, but ſuddenly ſwim down again: And in this ſtate they continued for ſome conſiderable time without any ſenſible alteration. About five hours after the laſt obſervation, the Fiſhes in the exhauſted Water became not ſo active (upon a motion given the Glaſs which contain'd them) as before: And thoſe Gudgeons included without any communication with the outward Air, now began conſiderably to abate of their vivacity; yet ſtill continued at times their motion upward and down again. At ſeven in the evening the included Fiſhes lay all at the bottom of the Glaſs with their Bellies upwards; nor upon ſhaking the glaſs could I ſet them in motion, or cauſe them to ſtir their fins or tails; only I could obſerve a motion in their mouths, which ſhew'd they were not perfectly dead. In this ſtate they lay for ſome time: But conſidering the Experiment would not be complete, if I did not attempt their Recovery by taking off the braſs cover, being very ſure they muſt have died in ſome ſmall time, under the Cirumſtances they were then in; accordingly I took off the cover, and gave the ſurface of the Water a free and open communication with the external Air. At about ten at night T obſerv'd them again, at which time their Recovery was ſo evident that upon a little diſturbing the glaſ  that  they ſunk haſtily æ the bpuam without any  Mo ion of th ir Fins or ails.  næ From the 9hole AccountI ohſerve;. i ꝶ7m That Water purg'd of Air ſo far as tHẽ Method here made uſe of, is capable to ã”ò ĩ, renders it not altogether unfit to ſup-  ſort the Lives of Water Animals. For alssthough when the Fiſhes were firſt put in, s ànd for ſome Hours aſter, they ſeemd to. qſuffer ſome uneaſineſ; yet at Iength the. Water became more familiar to them, or. e their Conſtitutions in ſome meaſure did ſo s conform, as to render the Water to them,  and them to the Water more agreeable;  Otherwiſe I do not ſee how their Recovery eè ſhould follow, ſince upon examining, littſe t õr no alteration could be found in the s Circumſtances of the Water, from the time sthe Fiſhes were firſt put in.” lli  Stecondly, The Fiſhes included with their  Water from any Communication with the e external Air, plainly demonſtrate, that  common Water in its Natural State is not s ũlone ſuſficient to preſerve the Lives of ĩts  Natural Animals. Hence it follows, that in Ponds, when the Water comes to be  Frozen over with a pretty thick Ice, the  Fiſhes in the ſaid Ponds are very likely, if  not certain to periſh, upon the Continuance  of ſuch a Congelation for ſome time on their e Surfaces; unleſs (as in the latter part of the  Experiment) the Impediment which hin-  GK w,  stp-—v r .. ſj æ 3 /l 7 Di I&R  A ) 7eſ Juoſ3©:w monqt r75 ſ⸗ til ⸗ i  derd the immediate Contact of the Air to  t the Surface of the Water, he remov'd; that  js, by breaking Holes in the Ice, whereby  it is reſtord, and undoubtedly will perform e the ſame thing as my Removal of the Braſs  Plate. This is to be underſtood only in  Ponds where the Water is ſtagnant; for  where there are Springs, or a current of  Water conſtantly ſucceeding under the Ice, s the effect moſt likely will not be the ſame. Remar. Can any thing be more plainly proved by Experiment than the vivifying quality in Air? How ſoon were the Gudgeons in the ſecond Glaſs juſt on the point of expiring for want of a communication with the external Air; and how ſoon revived at the admiſſion of it? Who, unleſs he were quite a Sceptic, can read the Experiment and not be convinced of the vivifying quality in that Element, B. What was his next Objection? A.  A clear glaſs Jar of fair Water was s put under the Receiver of an Air-pump, where the exhauſtion was no ſooner begun,  but the little expanſive particles were plainly s ſeen to riſe and eſcape through the body of sthe Water to the ſurface all the time of exshauſtion. m His whole Reply to which is- - No Proof that this is electric matter ſal.. (à) Since the Gentleman objects that it is no Prooſ, that the Air riſing out of the Water was electric matter, I ſhould be glad to be informd what it is? ſince Water is by no means permeable by the common Air,    I II ad alluded to Sir Iſaoc Newton's ſecond ꝶ ſi of Reaſoning in Philoſophy, vi⸗. ſo ilt ſime Efcis we nut as Jar a paſith aſign the ſame Cauſe ; the magnetic Virtue, which moves the iron or ſteel Filings beyond the Glaſ, and the Pneuma or electrical Virtue juſt diſcoverd, which moves the Feather, Ieaf Gold, Ieaf Braſs, &c. ſo vigorouſly beyond the Glaſ5 muſt be the ſame identical ſubtile Agent, acting in different conditions and forms. Tbeg therefore this Rule may be particularly attended to, ſince many phyſical Experiments will be greatly illuminated by conſidering it attèntively, which would otherwiſe ſeem much more abſtruſe and unintelligible..

I can however with great Truth affirm, that this ĩs the ſirſt time I ever heard any of Sir Iſaac's Rules ſo decriedl. Eſſays, Sect. 129. 135. &c.

B. I think your Friend has ſhewn his Wit at the Expence of his Judgement, and let him enjoy his dear-bought Purchaſe; but let us proceed. A. He further affirms it to be  demonſtra-  ble that the elaſtic Air, diſcoverd to exiſt  in the pores of groſs Bodies, is very diffe-  rent from electric Matter, although the direct contrary of this Aſſertion appears moſt evident; therefore the objection can never be admitted without proof. Eſſays, part 3d. ſect. 18 1. Martin's Experiment, he ſays, proves only that there is Air containd lE lli in in theſe ſubſtances in an elaſtic ſtate: *⸗ It does  by no means prove that the greateſt quantity  of Air produced by Dr. Hales Experiments was not in a fix'd ſtate as a part of the Subſtance of the Bodyoperated upon (æ); and there is no  doubt but a Eody, aſter having all its elaſtic  Air extracted by the Air-pump, would ſtill  yvield nearly the ſame quantity of Air menti-  oned in the Doctor's Experiments. In Part 3d. chap. 11th of my Eſſays are contained two Experiments of that celebrated Writer Dr. Hales, vho fancied he could, by Fermentation, Diſtillation, &c. metamorphoſe ſolid Bodies into Air.Among many others, the two particular Bodies whereon the Experiments were made were the human Calculus and 54 cubical Inches of Brandy; One half of the weight of the former was converted into what he calls his artificial Air; whereas the latter L L] L] L c L] (a) Here it is plain, that my Friend was credulous enough to think with Dr. Hales, that part of the groſs ſubſtance itſelf was metamorphoſed into Air. When the Dr. made thoſe Experiments, he had never ſeen any which proved that a moſt exquiſitely rare, elaſtic and pure Air xiteò in the pores of groſs Bodies; otherwiſe tis preſumed he would never have broached ſo wild and inconſiſtent a Doctrine; whereas my Friend, being an accurate Electrician, was not neceſſarily ignorant of this as the Dr. was, and therefore the leſs excubble. A Letter of Encomiums was ſent me 150 Miles, containing among many other things the following obſervation on that particular ſubject. I thank you too for the Attention  you have beſtowed on that wild modern ſubject the gene-  yation of Air, to which I never could be reconciled, and  always imagined the Fact to be as you have pu| it,” afforded  5 -  Z—— iili  — — —.. afforded but very little. The Reaſon I aſſignd for this was as follows. The ſubtile Spirit or pure Air contained in the pores of thoſe Bodies before their Diſſolution do, when analyzed into their firſt Principles, naturally mix and incorporate with thoſe minute particles of groſs matter, in a ſimilar manner, as when in their original ſtate; and thus an artificial Air is generated as elaſtic and ponderous, and in moſt other reſpects the ſame as common Air, conſequently as permanent as that The eaſier the Body is diſſolved, and the more free the terreſtrial corpuſcles riſe in the Diſtillation, the greater is the quantity of what he calls the new generated Air. p. 387. Sect. I90. This ſeems to be the only Reaſon, why ſo great a quantity was generated, when the human Calculus was diſtilled; one half of the weight of the ſtone was by this means volatiliſfed and incorporated with the contained ther. p. 387. ſect. 19I. This appears likewiſe to be confirmed, by conſidering a quite different and contrary deception, which happened when the maſs to be analyzed contained almoſt the greateſt quantity of the pure elementary Air or Spirit, and very little groſs matter. p. 387. ſect. 192. In Experiment 66. Vol. I. Dr. Hales found very little Air in 54 cubic Inches of Brandy: Had it been a highly rectified Spirit, he would have found none, all would have eſcaped, there Q being  being no gioſs matter to riſeand incorporate ith it tò prevent it. p. 387. ſect. 193. Hence it comes to nũ that when there ĩs contained in the maſs to be analyzed the greateſt quantity of all, of the pure ſubtile elemontary Air, that no artificial Air can then be formed. Rectified Spirits of Wine ſeem, as it were, the pure Air or Fire in a liquid form. P 388. ſect. 194. To this he ſneeringly replies,  Is Sir Inac  Newtorn's /Ether then come at laſt to be rece tified Spirit of Wine; and is Alcohol and  Electricity the ſame thing ; I anſwer, it is, and for the forementioned Reaſons, i. e. when reduced to ſuch a liquid Form; and whoever denies it will be expected to ſhew a more plauſible one,, why the human Calculus yielded ſo great a quantity of elaſtic Air, and why almoſt a quart of Brandy yielded ſo very little. N. B. He made many more Objections, though not one that contained any thing remarkable. His Apology for not giving Reaſons for the Objections he makes, is, that it would be too much for the compaſs of a Letter, which is thought but a ſlender Apology for giving no Reaſons for hardly any of thems at leaſt, not any that were ſupported with either Experiments or, Arguments. Having gone over the moſt material Objections which that Gentleman has made to my Eſſays, and finding them incapable of overturning m = æSSsii ———— —————VUU U__16S ingmy Poſitions, I muſt beg leave to add, that where-ever Iam wrong in my Principles, or deductions from them, it would give me the ſincereſt pleaſure to be ſet right by any ſagacious Enquirer, who is capable of affording me better Informmtion. It is much to be wiſhed that a friendly Conference were carried on by the channel of ſome one of the periodical Papers, in order to ſettle philoſophical Points, particularly ſuch as are moſt doubtful. We might then with eaſe and preciſion attempt to diſcuſs even the very Fundamentals of Philoſophy, and not without ſome reaſonable hope of Succeſs: I mean we might then paſs a ſtrict and juſt ſcrutiny on thoſe grand Articles in diſpute, at which even the moſt learned Men ſo grievouſly ſtumble; viz. whether an univerſal Vacuum exiſts or an univerſal Plenum. For when once that is ſatiſfactorily ſettled, we ſhould no longer halt between two ſuch contradictory Opinions. If ſuch an amicable Conference as abovementiond were earneſtly and properly purſued by way of pro and con, the moſt doubtful Caſes would be brought to an Iſſue; ſince it muſt ſoon appear on which ſide the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt Evidence lies.  .

Dr. Henry More's Hylarchic Principle defined. B. FXx H O among the Moderns is lookd w & upon as the greateſt Advocate for electrical Philoſophy and the great Power and Force of the electrical    Fire? A. None can plead much more ſtrenuouſly for thoſe things, nor for the Univerſtlity of the Fire, than the ingenious Dr. Prieſtley, who informs his Readers of a variety of abſtruſe Phenomena of Nature which much perplexed the Philoſophers, ſince they could never account for them in a ſatisfactory manner: Phenomena in the Heavens, in the Earth, and in the Sea; vig. Aurora Borealis, Lightning, falling Stars, Fire-drakes, Fire-balls, and other meteors. Whirlwinds, Inundations, Hurricanes, Water ſpouts, &c. and even Earthquakes; all which are now with great reaſon ſuppoſed to be  - -ſin m .  — aa-—u reriusas fras ax s: u - eſfects of this grand Agent, the electrical re. lll The Dr. ſays, that  the Aurora Borealis being an electrical Phenomena was, he believes, never doubted from the Time that Lightning was proved to be one.” He takes notice that  the Meteor, hitherto called a falling Star, has puzaled all Philoſophers. Signom Beccaria, ſa) he ſays makes it pretevident that it is an electrical Appearance; d the Fact which he relates as a proof of it, exceedingly curious and remarkable, he inrms us that,  As he was one time ſitting with a Friend in the open Air an Hour after Sun ſet, they ſaw what is called a falling Star directing its courſe towards them, and apparently growing larger and larger till it diſappeared not far from them, when it left their Faces Hands and Clothes, with the Earth, and all neighbouring objects, ſuddenly illuminated with a diffuſed and lambent Light, attended with no noiſe at all. While they were ſtanding up, ſtaring and looking at each other, ſurpriſed at the appearance, a Servant came running to them out of a neighbouring Garden and aſked them if they had ſeen nothing, for that he had ſeen a light ſhine ſuddenly in the Garden, and eſpecially upon the Streams which he was throwing to water it. (a) An Italian Electrician,  Dr. Dr. Prieſtly at p. 352. ſays, that Appearances, which bear evident marks of electricity, have a very ſenſible progreſſive motion is demonſtrated from a variety of meteorological Obſervations. I ſhall relate one made by Mr. Chalmers when he was on board the Montague under the Command of Admiral Chambers. On the fourth of November 1749, in Lat. 420. 48. Long. 9. 3. he was taking an obſervation on the quarter Deck, abom ten Minutes before 22 when one of the quarter Maſters deſired he would Iook to the Windward; upon which he obſerved a large Ball of blue Fire rolling on the Surface of the Water, at about three Miles diſtant from them. They immediately lowered their top Sails, &. but it came down upon them ſo faſt, that before they could raiſe the main Tack, they obſerved the Ball to riſe almoſt perpendicular, and not above forty or fifty Yards from the main Chains; when it went off with an exploſion as if hundreds of Cannon had been fired at one Time, and left ſo great a ſmell of Brimſtone, that the Ship ſeemed to be nothing but ſulphur. After the Noiſe was over, which he believed did not Iaſt longer than half a Second, they found their main Top-maſt ſhattered into above a hundred Pieces, and the Main-maſt rent quite down to the Heel There were ſome of the Spikes, which. nail the Fiſh of the Main-maſt, drawn with ſuch Force out of the Maſt, and they ſtuck ſo faſt I;m in the main Deck, that the Carpenter was obliged to take an Iron Crow to get them out. There were five Men knocked down, and one of them greatly burnt by the exploſion. They believed, that when the Ball, which appeared to them to be of the bigneſs of a large Mill-ſtone, roſe, it took the middle of the main Top-maſt, as the head of the Maſt above the hounds was not ſplinterd. Dr. Pricſtley informs us,  That the fore-  mentioned SeigniorBeccaria takes ſome pains  to ſhew rhat Water-ſpouts have an electric s Origin. To make this more evident he firſt  deſcribes the Circumſtances attending their  Appearance; which are the following.”  They generally appear In calm Weather; the Sea ſeems to boil and ſend up a ſmoke  under them, riſing in a hill towards the  ſpout; at the ſame time Perſons who have  been near them have heard a rumbling  Noiſe. The form of a Water- ſpout is that  of a ſpeaking Trumpet, the wider end being  in the Clouds, the narrower end towards the  Sea. The ſize is various even in the ſame  ſpout. The colour is ſometimes inclining to  white, and ſometimes to black. Their poſis tion is ſometimes perpendicular to the Sea,  ſometimes oblique, and ſometimes the ſpout itſelf is in the form of a curve. Their cons tinuance is very, various, ſometimes diſapa pearing as ſoon as formed, and ſometimes continuing a conſiderable time; one that he R s had L L L L L] La] L - - a  n  , 52 Fa” ? æa æ  -A-- L) r. ll llE -  ————-r——/ _  124) Dialogue X. had heard of continued a whole hour, but they oſten vaniſh, and preſently appear in the ſame place.”  What Water-ſpouts are at Sea, the ſame are ſome kind of Whirl-winds and Hurricanes by Land: They have been known to tear up Trees, to throw down Buildings, make Caverns in the Earth; and in all theſe caſes to ſcatter Earth, Bricks, Stones, Timber, &c. to great diſtances in every direction. Great Quantities of Water have been left or  raiſed by them, ſo as to make a kind of deluge; and they have been àlways attended with a prodigious rumbling Noiſe.  That theſe Phenomena of Water-ſpouts, &c. depend upon Electricity, cannot but appear very probable, from the nature of ſeveral of them; but the conjecture is made more probable from the following additional Circumſtances. They generally appear in  Months peculiarly ſubject to Thunderſtorms, and are commonly preceded, accompanied, or followed by Lightning, Rain, or  Hail, the previous ſtate of the Air being ſimilar. Whitiſh or yellowiſh flaſhes of light have ſometimes been ſeen moving with prodigious ſwiftneſs about them. And laſtly, the manmr in which they terminate exactly è reſembles what might be expected from the prolongation of one of the uniform protuberances of electrical Clouds towards the Sea, the Waters and the Cloud mutually attractcc ing  Ing each other; for they ſuddenly contract  themſelves and diſperſe almoſt at once, the  Cloud riſing and the Water of the Sea under jt falling to its level. But the moſt remarke able Circumſtance, and the moſt favourable e to the ſuppoſition of their depending upon ss Electricity is, that they have been diſperſed by preſenting to them ſharp pointed Knives  and Swvords. This, at leaſt, is the conſtant s: practice of the Mariners in many parts of the  World where theſe Water- ſpouts abound; s and he was aſſured by ſeveral of them fhat a: the method had often been undoubtedly s ſucceſęful” B. To Seignior Beccaria's Theory of Waterfpoue and Hurricanes, Dr. Prieſtley adds a decription of a Hurricane in the Weſt Indies. ADd. We have frequent accounts of ſuch dreadful Hurricanes in America, from which moſt other parts of the known World are happily exempted. It is in a rainy Seaſon, principally in the Month of Auguſt, that they are aſſaulted by Hurricanes the moſt terrible, 10 which they are ſubject from the Climate. s This Calamity deſtroys at one ſtroke the  Labours of many Vears, and fruſtrates the moſt exalted hopes of the Planter; and often ⸗juſt at the moment when he thinks himſelf  out of the reach of fortune.It is a violent  ſtorm of Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightf ning, attended with a furious ſwelling of the  Sea, and fometimes with an Earthquake; in R 2 s ſhort   ſnort, with every Circumſtance which the ‘ Elements qan aſsembi that i is terrible and : deſtructive.” ſ c Firſt, They ſee, as a prelude of the onſ- ing havock, whole Fields of Sugar-canes whirld into the Air, and ſcatterd over the face of the Country. The ſtrongeſt Trees of the Foreſt are torn up by the Roots and driven about like ſtubble. Their Wind- mills are ſwept away in a moment. Their Works, the fixtures, the ponderous copper Boilers, and Stills of ſeveral hundred weight are wrench'd from the ground, and batterd to pieces. Their Houſes are no protection: The Roofſs are torn off at one blaſt; whilſt the Rain, which in an hour riſes five ſeet, ruſhes in upon them with an irreſiſtible violence.” The Hiſtorian informs us, that Dr. Stuely was of Opinion  That Earthquakes were the L c llIESS cc c LJ c x5 ~ probable effects of electrical Fire, upon the occaſion of the two Earthquakes in February and March 1749; and another in Northamptonſhire in September 1750. The Papers which Dr. Stukely deliverd to: the Royal Society on theſe occaſions, which were read in March 1749, and December 1750. Dr. Prieſtley ſays,  are valuable, and well deſerve cc cc c f the Attention of all Philoſophers and Electricians That Earthquakes are not owing to ſubterraneous Winds, Fires, Vapours, or any thing that occaſions exploſions, and heaves up (r27) up the ground, he thought might caſily be concluded from a variety of Circumſtances. In the firſt place, he thought there was no remarkable evidence of any cavernous ſtructure of the Earth but that on the contrary, there is rather reaſon t preſume that it is in a great meaſure ſolid, ſo as to leave little room for internal changes and fermentations within its ſubſtance; nor do Coal-pits, he ſays, when on fire, ever produce any thing reſembling an Earthquake.  Jt is not, he ſays,  upon the principle of any ſubterraneous exploſion that we can, in the leaſt, account for the manner in which Ships, far from any land, are affected during an Earthquake; which ſeems as if they ſtruck upon a rock, or as if ſomething thumpd againſt their hottoms: Even the fiſhes are affected by an Earthquake. This ſtroke therefore muſt be occaſioned by ſomething that could communicate motion with unſpeakably greater velocity than any heaving of the earth under the ſea by the elaſticity of generated vapours3 this could only produce a gradu⸗l ſwell, and could never give an impulſe to the water ſo as to make it feel like a ſtone.” s The Impreſſion made by an Earthquake by land and waters to the greateſt diſtances is obſervd to be inſtantaneous; which could only be effected by Electricity. In the Earthquake in September, the Concuſſion was felt through a ſpace of 100 miles in Iength and c 40 40 ĩn breadth, and as far as could be judgd at the ſame inſtant of time. That this tract of Land, which amounted to 400 ſquare miles in ſurface, ſhould be thrown into ſuch an agitation in a moment, is ſuch a prodigy, the Dr. ſays, as we could never believe or conceive, did we not know it to be fact from our Senſes. But if we ſeek the ſolution of it, we cannot think any natural Power equal to it, but that of Electricity, which acknowledges no ſenſible tranſition of time, no bounds I  TuE little damage generally done by Earthquakes, the Dr. thought to be an Argument of their being occaſioned by a ſimple vibration, or tremulous motion of the ſurface of the Earth by an electrical ſnap. This vibration, he ſays,* impreſſed on the Water, meeting with the ſolid bortoms of Ships and Lighters, occaſions that thump which is ſaid to be felt by them; yet of the millions of ordinary Houſes, that it paſſed over, not one fell. A Conſideration which ſufficiently points out, what ſort of a motion this was not, alſo what ſort of motion it was; and whence derivd: Not a Convulſion in the bowels of the Earth; but an uniſorm vihration along its ſurface like that of a muſical ſtring, or what we put a drinking Glaſs into by rubbing ones fimger on the edge, which yet, being brought to a certain pitch, breaks the Glaſ; undoubtedly, he adds,  an electrical repulſion of its parts.”  That s That Earthquakes are electrical Phenomena is further evident, he ſays,  from their chieſly affecting the Sea-coaſt, places along Rivers, and, I may add, eminences. The Earthquake in September ſpread moſtly to the North and South which the Dr. ys, t is the direction of the Spalding River; whereby it was conveyed to the Sea- ſhore, where it was particularly ſenſible; thence up Boſton Channel, and ſo up Bo”ton River to Lincoln. The greateſt part of this Earthquake diſplayed its Effects along and between the two Rivers Welland and Avon; and that from their ſources down to their mouths: It likewiſe reached the River Witham, which directed the electrical ſtream that way alſo to Lincoln; for which reaſon, meeting the ſame coming from Boſton, it was moſt ſenſibly felt there. It reacd likewiſe to the Trent at Nottingham, which convey d it to Newark. Bſ  The firſt electrical ſtroke in this Earthquake ſeemd to the Dr. to have been made on the high ground about Daventry in Northamptonſhire. From thence it deſcended chiefly eaſtward, and along the River Welland, ſfrom Harborough to Stamford, Spalding and the Sea; and along the Rivers Avon and Nen to Northampton, Peterborough, Wiſbich and the Sea: It ſpread itſelf all over the vaſt level of the Iſle of Ely, promoted by a great number of Canals, natural and artificial, made - for . e for draining that Country. It was ſtill con-  ducted eaſtward by Mildenhall River in Suf-  folk to Bury and the parts adjacent. All theſe Circumſtances duly conſidered were to him a Confirmation of the Doctrine he advancd on that ſubject.  It muſt ſeem very ſurpriſing and unaccountable to Perſons unacquainted with Electricity, that all this could he performed in the leaſt inſtant of time, notwithſtanding it was conducted to, and touch'd at ſo many different placess. However, the ſagacious Experimentaliſt is well aſſured, that this is a moſt undoubted truth; and our electrical Experiments are manifeſt proofs, that the progreſſive motion of the Fire is ſo inſtantaneous as not to admit of the leaſt ſenſible tranſition of time in its paſſage, even to the moſt diſtant parts.” According to Dr. Prieſtley, not only Dr. Stuhely, but the renowned Dr. Hales, Mr. Hartman, and others were of Opinion, that Earthquakes were electrical Phenomena. The Dr. obſerving the electrical Fire from his Battery to paſs over the ſurface of the Water ſu), in order to arrive at his braſs Rod, ſays, The reſemblance of the electric matter  over the ſurface of the water, and that which  Dr. Stukely ſuppoſed to ſweep the ſurface of  the earth, when a conſiderable quantity of ĩt  is diſcharg]d to the clouds during an Earth-  quake, immediately ſuggeſted to him, that the L L] - æa a  a  Aa  aAa A æ (a) See his Hiſtory of Electricity, ꝑ. 649. s Water  —r —— ES Water in his Experiment over which the electrical Fire paſſed, and which was viſibly thrown into a tremulous motion thereby, muſt receive a concuſfion reſembling that which is given to the Waters of the Sea on ſuch an occation.  To try this, he ſays,  Myſelf and ſeveral other Perfons who were preſent, put our hands into the water, when an electric flaſh, as before, paſſed over its ſurface, and we felt a ſudden Concuſfion given to them exactly, like that which is ſuppoſed to affect Ships at Sea during an Earthquake.

It will be very eaſy for me to do this, as I find them alread collected to my hands by Dr. Watſn ſa)  A luminous appearance, which muſt have been of an electrical nature, is mentioned by Plutarch in his Life of Lyſander  ta) Philoſoph. Tranſact. Vol. 48. Exp. iſt. ꝑ. 210. lli 5  Plimy, Dialogue X.  Pliny, in his ſecond Book of Natural Hiſtory, calls thoſe appearances Stars; and tells us, that they ſettled not only upon the Maſts and other parts of Ships; but alſo upon Mens Heads.  Stars make their appearance both at Land and Sea. I have ſeen a light in that form on the Spears of Soldiers, keeping Watch by night, on the Ramparts. They are ſeen alſo on the Sail-yards, and other parts of Ships, making an audible ſound, and frequently changing their places. Two of theſe lights forebode good weather, and a proſperous Voyage; and drive away one that appears ſingle, and wears a threatning Aſpect. This the Sailors call Helen, but the two they call Caſtor and Pollux, and invoke them as Godũs. Theſe lights do ſometimes, about the evening, reſt on Men's Heads, and are a great and good omen. But theſę are among the awful Mpyſteries of Nature.  Seneca in his natural Queſtions, chap. I. takes notice of the ſame Phenomena.A  Star ſettled on the Lance of Gylippus, as he was ſailing to Syracuſe; and Spears have ſeemd to be on fire in the Roman Camp.  About that time there was a very extraordinary Appearance in the Army of Cæſar. In the month of February, about the ſecond watch of the night, there ſuddenly aroſe a thic cloud followed by a ſnower of ſtones; and the ſame night, the points of the Spears c belon ging belonging to the fifth Legion ſeemd to take Fire l ill lill s The Spears of ſome Soldiers in Sicily, and a walking ſtick, which a Horſeman in Sardinia was holding in his hand, ſeemed to be on firee The Shores were alſo luminous with frequent Fires li  Theſe Appearances are called both by the French and Spaniards, inhabiting the Coaſts of the Mediterranean Sea, St. Helme's or St. Telme's Fires; by the Italians, the Fires of St. Peter and St. Nicholas. And are freuently taken notice of by the Writers of Voyz s. lEE aIf ſome late accounts from France (adds the Dr.) are to be depended on, this Phenomenon has been obſervd at Plauzet for time immemorial, and Mr. Binon the Cure of the plase ſays, that for twenty ſeven Years, which e has reſided there, in great ſtorms accompanied with black Clouds, and frequent Lightnings, the three pointed extremities of the croſs of the ſteeple of that place appear'd ſurrounded with a body of flame; and that when this Phenomenon has been ſeen, the Storm was no longer to be dreaded, and calm weather returned ſoon after.”  Modern Hiſtory furniſhes a great number of Examples of Flames appearing at the extremities of pointed metallic Bodies, projecting into the Air. Little notice was taken of theſe, while the cauſe of them was unknown; but S 2  ſince  e ſince their near aſſinity with Lightning has  been diſcoverd, they have been more attended c to and collectedve Here it may be obſervd, that electrical Philoſophers are not ſingular in repreſenting the electrical Fire as an univerſal Principle: Dr. Prieſtley ſeems entirely of their Opinion, and ſuppoſes that all the appearances which he had been enumerating were electrical Phenomena, that is, that they were effects of electrical Fire. l B. What do electrical Philoſophers think reaſonable to conclude from ſuch Appearances? . That from ſuch an ample field, ſuch a vaſt fund of indubitable facts, they may ſafely conclude the electrical fluid to be a general Agent, and an univerſal Principle in the ſtricteſt Senſe; ſince there was a great variety of appearances in nature which ſeemd to point out ſuch a general active Agent or firſt inſtrumental mover, too obvious to be overlook'd by the moſt ſagacious Philoſophers of all Ages; many of whom, both antient and modern, ſeem by their Writings to have had very clear glimpſes, and adequate Ideas of it, before it was actually diſcover'd by modern Experiments, though diſtinguiſhed by different Appellations as Fire, Anima Mundi, Subtile Medium or Ather, Materia ſubtilis, &c. Chumbers under the term Anima Mundi informa us, that ſome ſuppoſe Plato by his Anima Mundi to have meant God or the ſpirit of God, and to have taling   taken the hint from Moſes, who in his account of the firſt days Creation ſays,  rbe Spirit of God  moved on the Face of the Deep”  The modern Platoniſts explain their maſters Anima Mundi by a certain univerſal ætherial Spirit, which in the Heavens exiſts perfectly pure, as retaining its proper nature; but, on Earth, pervading elementary Bodies, and intimately mixing with all the minute Atoms thereof, aſſumes ſomewhat of their nature, and becomes of a peculiar kind.”  They add, that this Anima Mundi, which more immediately reſides in the celeſtial Regions as its proper ſeat, moves and governs the heavens in ſuch a manner, as that the heavens themſelves firſt received their exiſtence from the fecundity of the ſame Spirit: For that this anima being the primary ſource of Life, every where breath'd a Spirit like itſelf; by virtue whereof various things were  framed conformable to the Divine Idcas. Sir. Iſauc Newtorns ſubtile Medium or æAther exactly coincides with the anima mundi of the Platoniſts. The Carteſians have their ſubtile matter, which anſwers to moſt of the Uſes and Intentions of the ſame Principle. The learned Biſhop oſ Cloyne, as well as many of the antient Pſnet⸗ ſubſtitute fire as the anima mundi, which appears to come neareſt of all to the electrical Philoſophy. The Appellation, Nature, is explaind much in the ſame manner. - a  - n L L L] L L] L -   The  The word Nature in a ſtrict ſenſe is uſcã for the Action of Providence, the Principle of all things, or that Spiritual Power or Being which is diffuſed throughout the Creation, and moves and acts in all Bodies, and gives them certain Properties and produces certain Effects. This is the Senſe which Mr. Boyl conſiders as the moſt uſua. NATuRE iĩs nothing elſe but Gon, acting himſelf, and according to certain Laws, which he himſelf has fixed.  This ſeems pretty agreeable to the opinion of many of the Antients, Who made Nature the God of the Univerſe, who preſides over and governs all.”  F. Mallebranche ſays, the Nature ſo much talk'd of in the Schools is fit for nothing but to lead us back to Idolatry: The antient Heathens heroby underſtanding ſomething, which without being God, acts continually throughout the Univerſee Thus the idol Nature muſt be an actual Principle which under God is the next and immediate cauſe of all the changes which befal matter,; which ſeem to fall in with the opinion of the Anima Mundi; as if Nature were a ſubſtitute of God, or a collateral cauſe with God, or a middle Being between God and created Things” Vide Chambers under the word lature. : To theſe might be added the Iearned Dr. enry More's hylarchic Principle or univerſal Spirit 3pirit of the World, which hęthus defines:  A Subſtance incorporeal, but without Senſe and. Animadverſion,, pervading the: whole matter of the Univerſe, and exerciſing a plaſtical Power therein according to the ſundry prediſpoſitions and occaſions in the parits it works upon; raiſing ſuch Phenomena in the world, by directing the parts of the matter and their motion, as not to be reſolved into mere mechanical Powers ſa.” DIALOG UE.

B. TTU O W do modern Philoſophers aci l count for the Origin of Motion?  rs——— (a) See his Treatiſe Book 2d. Chap. i2. P. 193. A. The cauſe of Motion in the World has heęn much controverted, and. eſteemed one of the moſt abſtruſe Phenomena. Many eminent Philoſophers have made much enquiry concerning its nature, and taken great pains to ſhew whence it proceeds. Some ſuppoſe it to be a Principle or Property inherent in Matter or Body itſelf, whilſt others are of opinion, that it is. a created Eſſence, diſtinct from matter, and acts as a Cauſe: Many other wild and incoherent notions of it have been at different times maintained, all of which ſeem owing to the perplexed ſtate the ſubject was neceſſarily involved in; neceſſarily I ſay, it being next to impoſſible to form any adequate Idea of the cauſe of motion before Fire was diſcovered, by means of the electrical Apparatus, to be a permanent, durable Principle. B. How do modern Philoſophers account for the Cauſe of Motion? Dr. Keil, In the 6th Lecture of his Introduction to natural Philoſophy, p- 68. Edi. 2d. when ſpeaking of motion calle it  the nobleſt  Apfection that Body is endued with; ſã)  by the mediation whereof nature diicovers  herſelf acting in that variety of things which  ought not to be beheld without wonder and  aſtoniſhment, and without which all the or-  nament and beauty in the world would per-  (a) Here it is plain Dr. Keil, was of Opinion that motion was a Property or Quality inherent in Matter. iſh, ith, and a horrid darkneſs and àn infinite numbneſs would poſſeſs every thing, On this depend the viciſſitudes of days and nights, and the ſo great variety of cold and heat, ſnow, rain, and ſun-ſhine, ſucceeding each other, and all the ſeaſons of the year. By Motion, Plants grow, Trees are nouriſhd, and Animals live; ſince Life itſelf conſiſts only in Motion, that is the Circulation of the Blood. But why do I ſpend time in enumerating particulars, ſince all things owe their birth to Motion?  The Science therefore of Motion is ſo neceſſary to philoſophiſe aright, that not the leaſt operation of nature can be inveſtigated without itt. Hence the famous and moſt true ſaying of the Philoſopher, Motion being unknown, Nature muſt of neceſſity be ſo likeiſe. The Philoſophers, or rather Metaphyſicians have had various diſputes concerning the Nature, Cauſes, and Communication of Motion; and the Confuſion of Ideas, and the Darkneſs that thence aroſe, appear to have been ſo great, that amongſt the Follies of Diſputation, the natural and ſimple notion that they had of it, ſeems to have been loſt amongſt them. For there can ſcarce be found one of the common People, or the meaneſt Artificer, but he knows more of the true Nature and Cauſe of Motion than all theſe wrangling Philoſophers together; ſome T  of a A A n A  A ~ A -n - a N L L ] Lal ] EE L s (140) Dialogue XI. of whom were arrived to that height of Folly, as to deny all Motion as a thing impoſſible to Bodies; and they propoſe ſome Cavils, whereby they flatter themſelves, that they had demonſtrated its impoſſibility.  We will produce here ſome of their ſtrongeſt Arguments; and the firſt ſhall be that of Diodorus Cronus, namely, If a Body moves, it muſt either move in the place where it is, or in the place where it is not, both which are impoſſible: For if it moves in the place where it is, it will never depart from that place, and ſo there will be no motion: In like manner it cannot move where iĩt ĩs not, becauſe nothing acts in the place where it is not; therefore a Body will not move at all. I anſwer, that a Body neither moves in the place where it is, nor in the place where it is not; but it moves from one place to another.  The ſecond Argument ſhall be that of Zeno, to which he gave the name of Achilles; and therefore endeavours to prove that if there be any ſuch thing as motion, Achilles, though ever ſo ſwiſt, could never overtake a Tortoiſe though the ſloweſt of Animals. The Argument is this: Suppoſe Achilles to be diſtant from the Tortoiſe a certain finite ſpace, as for example, a mile; and let us ſuppoſe he moves an hundred times faſter than the Tortoiſe; therefore whilſt Achilles runs one miſe, the Tortoiſe has moved the hundredih part of a mile; ſo that Achilles has not yot overtaken overtaken the Toriſe: And again, whilſt Ahilles paſſes over that hundredih part of a mile, the Tortoiſe, in the mean while, will have creep'd through the ten thouſandth part of a mile; inſomuch that neither has Achilles yet overtaken the Tortoiſe After the ſame manner, whilſt Achilles runs the ten thouſahdth part of a mile, the Tortoiſe will have advanced forward the millionth part of a mile; ſo that Achilles has not yet come up with the Tortoiſe And ſo he may go on in mfinitum; nor will he ever be able to overtake the Tortoiſe; but there will be always ſome diſtance between Achilles and the Tortoiſe.” This is the famous Argument of Zeno; to anſwer which, ſome have written whole Treatiſes: But we ſhall eaſily diſſolve the knot, by ſaying, that a Mile, together with the hundredth part of a mile, together with the ten thouſandth part of a mile, with the millionth part of a mile, and ſo on in infinitum, will be equal to a finite quantity. For it is demonſtrated by the Arithmeticians, that the ſum of any ſeries of quantities decreaſing in any geometrical proportion in infinitum, will be equal to a finite quantity; but the hundredth part of a mile, together with the ten thouſandth part of a mile, together with the millionth part, together with the hundred millionth part, and ſo on in infinitum is a ſeries of quantities, decreaſing in geometrical 2  pro- proportion in inſinitum: 60 that its fum, ſince it is equal toa finite quantity, may be run over by a body moving with a given velocity, in a finite time. For let us ſuppoſe Achilles, in the ſpace of an hour, to run a mile, therefore he will paſs over the hundredth part of a mile in the hundredth part of an hour, and the ten thouſandth part of a mile in the ten thouſandth part of an houry and after the ſame manner he will move through the millionth part of a mile, in the millionth part of an hour; and ſo oſ the reſt. If therefore one hour, together with the hundredth part of an hour, together with the ten thouſandth part of an hour, together with the millionth part of an hour, together with the hundred millionth part of an hour, &e. in infinitum: If, Iſay, the ſum of the ſeries continued in infinitum is equal to an infinite ſpace of time, it is certain Achilles would never overtake the Tortoiſe in any finite ſpace of time: But ſince, as we ſaid before, the hundredth, ten thouſandth, millionth, &c. parts of an hour, is a ſeries of quantities decreaſing in gometrical proportion in infinitum, its ſum will be equal to a finite quantity, viz. the ninety ninth part of an hour, as might be demonſtrated; and within that ſpace of time, all the particles of time, however infinite in number, will be paſſed by. We ſay thereſore, that Aehiiles will overtake the Tor toiſe, alter one hour; and all thoſe partiil clęs c cles of time, contained in the foregoing ſeries, and which are infinite in number, are expired,  that is, he will arrive at the Tortoiſe, aſter  one hour and the ninety ninth part of an  hour; and ſo the force of this Argument is  deſtroyed; though its Patrons have ſo often  boaſted of it as unanſwerable.” lill Thus the Dr. goes on haranguing and triſling with his Pupils about the word Motion; but never attempts to make the leaſt enquiry aſter its Cauſe, though he exclaims ſo much at others for not doing it. This Story of Achilles and the Tortoiſe put me in mind of another, which might have been propoſed, as bearing ſome aſfinity to it, though equally trifling, viz. If the hour and minute Indexes of a Clock were both oſ them to ſet out from the hour 12, for according to their fallacious method of arguing, the minute Index, although it moved ræ times faſter than the other, could yet never be able to overtake it. This Problem, like the other, would be found a ſeries of numbers decreaſing in geometrical proportion. As a ſolution of this Problem may amuſe ſome Tyros, I ſhall take the Liberty of obliging them, and others, if they pleaſe, may paſs it over. Firft, Since in the time that the minute Index. moves 12 hours, the hour Index moves but one hour, the proportion will be as 12 to I, conſequently, as 12: 1:: I:,5, and as 12: I :.: 5 of, and ſo on in infinitum, vi. a llinmib ſerios ſeries of quantities continually decreaſing in geometrical proportion. Secondly, The moſt conciſe method of ſolving this will be by ſpecious Arithmetic: The proportion being as 12 is to I; leta = 12 and b=1, then as a:b:: b W andas a: b:: v. y and as a: 5:: : a a a aa aq j 4 5 5 5 5 7 and ſois, : t rug L &c. a ſeries of quantities decreaſing in geometrical proportion in infinitum. Thirdly, If the ſolution be performd by ſexagenary Arithmetic, the Series will be 1 hour, 5 minutes, 27 ſeconds, 16 thirds, 21 4ths, 49 gths, 5 6ths, 27 7ths, 16 8ths, 21 9ths, 49 10ths, 5 11ths, 27 raths, 16 15ths, 21 141hs, 49 15ths, &c. in infinitum; the five numbers 5, 27, 16, 21, 49, Will continually circulate, or be repeated, conſequently the Series can never terminate; however we are certain at the beginning of the Series, that the whole time amounts to but little more than 1 hour, 5 minutes, 27 ſeconds, and that all the following part of the ſeries, though carried on ever ſo far, cannot amount to ſo much as half another ſecond of time.— Dr. Keil inſtances in two or three more, but all equally triſling. Mr. Rowning in his Introduction to his ſyſtem of natural Philoſophy, informs us that  Des Cartes ſuppoſes that God created a cer-  tain quantity of Motion, and aſſigned it to  ihe whole maſ of created Matter, and that c motion   c (145) motion being once created could nò more be annihilated without an Omnipotent hand, than Body itſelf; in conſaquence of which, he was obliged to teach, that the quantity of Motion is always the ſame; ſo that if all the Men and Animals in the World were moving, yet ſtill there would be no more Motion than when they are at reſt; the Motion which they had not when at reſt being transferred to the sther. So unaccountable are the Motions of this great Philoſopher, that it is ſurpriſing his Doctrine ſhould have met with ſuch univerſal reception and have got ſo ſtrong a party of Philoſophers on its ſide: That notwithſtanding it was more abſfurd than the Schoolmen's ſubſtantial forms, they muſt all be exploded to make way for his ingenious Hy potheſis.” The ſame Author informs us, that s ſo vild and extravagant have been the notions of a great part of Philoſophers both ancient and modern, that it is hard to determinẽ whether they have been more diſtant in their ſentiments from the Truth or from one another, or have not exceeded the Fancies of the moſt fabulous Writers, even Poets and Mythologifts. ——This was owing to a precipitate proceeding in the ſearching into   Nature; their neglecting the uſe of Geome-  try and Experiments, the moſt neceſſar?  helps to the finding out of Cauſes, and proæ portioning them to Effects.' But, M. Rowning Rowning himſelflis hero goilty of- à greãt miftake that he was nõt awure 6f, norin eeũ cõuld he be?: The only Reaſon of ſuch different ſentiments was, that former Philoſopher⸗, being ignorant of that univerſal Fire, which wę have ſince diſcovered, were neceſſarily wron in many things; this is what appears to be ihẽ true Reaſon of that variety of different Sentiments among them. Mr. Rowning is ſilent as to the Cauſe of Motion any farther than informing us what were the Sentiments of Dei Cartes concerning it, as abovementioned. ilili According to Dr. Stephenſin, Motion is an abſolute Cauſe, and acts as a delegated Agent to bring about or produce natural Effects. li I  Among ſecondary Cauſes, Motion, he ? ſays, is the principal immediate Agent and Inſirument of all the Effects, Operations and Phenomena, that are produced in the material Univerſe, and is the primary Cauſe upoh which the Power, Force, and Energy of eve y Body, or Syſtem of Bodies wholiy de pends. For Matter, or Bodies without Motion; can neither ſuffer any change in themſelves, nor produce any change or alteration in other Bodies, but would remain for ever in a ſtate of abſolute Reſt and Inactivity; ſo that whatever changes or mutations happen in Bodies; the ſame are all neceſſarily produced by, Motion, either added thereto, or ſubtracted' therefrom. For which Reafon we find, that f according r ai L n L L L) L L according to the preſent eſtabliſhed order of Nature, matter and motion are renderd inſeparable; the whole ſyſtem of matter, and all material Beings, both animate and inanimate, being for ever ſubject to ſome degree of motion, more or leſs, by which they are kept in a continual circulation or fluxion, and thereby fitted to undergo and paſ's thro' different ſtates, forms, periods and appearances, according to the final Ends and Appointments of Providence. And thus we obſerve, that all animal and vegetable Bodies from the higheſt to the loweſt degree in the Scale of Life, as well as all other material Beings, even the great Planetary and Cometary Bodies themſelves, which compoſe this Solar Syſtem, are conſtituted and formed to continue only for a certain Revolution and Period, ſome longer, ſome ſhorter, which is no other than a progreſſive motion, whereby they paſs through different ſcenes and ſtates, and put on different forms and appearances, which when accompliſhed, they become reſolved again into the general elementary maſs of matter, though even then they are neither diveſted of Exiſtence, nor Motion, but are ſtill in a Progreſſion to new Life, Form and Being ſa)See Dr. Stephenſon's Introducion to his Mechanical Phyſician, p.

But ſo long as we were ignorant of the Exiſtence of Fire as a durable Principle, ſo long were we neceſſarily ignorant of the Cauſe of ſuch Motion. Before ſuch a ſubtile Medium or Ather was diſcovered, the Cauſe of Motion was given up, along with other immechanical Cauſes, to be perform'd by the immediate influence of the Firſt Cauſe.” ; s Before ſuch a Diſcovery was made, we ſeem'd naturally enough tò conclude that all Matter was inert; whereas we now find we were greatly miſtaken, and that there are active particles of matter exiſting, as well as paſſive, the effects of which active particles, particularly thoſe containd in the pores. of groſs Bodies, were ſuch, that the groſs particles zhemſelves appeared (in many different Circumſtances) to be endued with active Properties. But had we attended to Sir Iſaac's Principia, ve might have learned better: There he informs us, that the cauſe of that activity is not in the groſs particles themſelves, as we imagined, but in the ſubtile elaſtic Medium exiſting in their pores ſæ).

This æ This was a much more natural deſcription of it than could at that time have been reaſonably expected, particularly, as Sir Iſaac confeſs'd he was at a loſs for proper Experiments to inveſtigate the laws by which it operated.”  Nature almoſt every where appears repletewith phyſical Cauſes to produce all kinds of neceſſary motions, not only among Animals, Vegetables, &c. but even in the celeſtial Regions. For all motions in the Microcoſm, both voluntary and natural, the moſt ample proviſion is made: And can we imagine a leſs proviſion for motion in the Macrocoſm, particularly,. now we have made a complete diſcovery of ſuch an active and extenſive Agent, exiſting in Nature, as was never credited before? :  A principal Cauſe of Motion among inanimate things is the deſtroying and reſtoring the Equilibrium; the effects of almoſt all thoſe remarkable Experiments in Electricity,; appear to be founded on Nature's Efforts to reſtore the deſtroyd Equilibrium, by means of the exquiſite elaſticity and rarity of the ſubtile luid, alternately exerting their different and contrary forces, acting with, or counteracting the ſpring and preſſure of the Atmoſphere. Heat and Cold are likewiſe productive of like effects; which two oppoſite qualities are wonderful, and were in ſuch remarkable eſteem with the great Lord Bacon, U 2  that a  that he compared them torthe two hands of  Nature.

In ſhort, I can, as I ſaid, find no meaning affixed to either of the two words Gravity or Attraction ? 4a. What you ſay is true, and was all owing to the perplexd ſtate of things and the obſcurity in which Philoſophy was then involv'd. The caſe was the ſame with the preſent Electrical Philoſophers; nor could they extricate themſelves before the modern Experiments cleared away. the darkneſs: To ſay the truth, before that time it was morally impoſſible to behold things as they really were; the inconſiſtencies and diſingenuity of Men in making uſe of two ſuch different words in one and the ſame Senſe is too apparent to be deniedl. i B. What are the Sentiments of Electrical Philoſophers as to this intricate ſubject, Gravity; for it would be a great ſatisfaction to me to hear a rational account of it? A. I will readily give you the moſt rational I can, and what appears ſo to them. Gravitation, or a centripetal tendency of Bodies is twofold; firſt, a tendency towards the centre of the ſolar Syſtem; and, ſecondly, a tendency towards the centre of the Earth: the moſt obvious of which is the latter, and is evidently pointed out by all falling bodies; and the former as treated of and explaind, in the Theory oſ the Sun. p. 231I. of the Eſſays. B. B. How do they account for the cauſe of that centripetal tendency ſo obvious in all hodies;1 mean, that tendency of all common matter towards the centre of the Earth? A. From an exterior preſſure of the univerſal elaſtic ætherial fluid, which vifibly appears when we conſider the Phenomena exhibited by falling bodies, I mean, thofe remarkable accelerations, which not only plainly point out the great violence of the force or cauſe, but are alſo plain indications that the cauſe of the gravity of bodies towards the centre of the carth is an exterior and impelling force, and not an inherent and eſſential property oſ matter, as hath been heretofore maintained by many others. The electrical Philoſophers allow indeed, that to outward appearance the Cauſe of Gravity towards the centre of the Earth ſeems to be a real and eſſential property of matter, interwoven, as it were, into the very conſtituent parts of the matter of which our Bodies are compoſed. But nothing can be a plainer proof, that the cauſe of the gravitating tendency of all Bodies towards the centre of the Earth is an exterior force, than thoſe accelerations of the motion of deſcending bodies. Beſides, were the cauſe ſeated within the bodies themſelves, their motion when deſcending muſt be more regular and uniform, conſequently the accelerations are the effects of an external force ſa). lll (a) See ꝑ. 65. 66. on falling Bodies. B. As you are now uhi of the Caut of Gravity, you muſt excuſe me if I claim yo promiſe of recapitulating your Theory of the Nature and Office of the Sun. A. I ſall with pleaſure fulfil my Engagement to you, and am inclined to hope, that if you conſider my Theory with due attention, (ſor Iwill venture to call it mine, having never read or heard of it before) you may at length thank me for the Recapitulation, ſince it will explain to you in the moſt natural and cleareſt manner hitherto known, the true cauſe of the centripetal tendency of all the heavenly Bodies towvards ſbheir Centre. In the ſirt place I muſt inform you, that the Dimenſions of the Sun are briefly as follow: BDiameter, 796400 Engliſh Miles, Circumſerence, 2 501970 Engliſh Miles, Area of the greateſt Circle or Face of the Sun. 498 142274784 ſquare Miles.Superficial Content, 1992 569099136 ſquare miles. Solid content, 2644796742356 18688 cubical miles. c What a ſtupendous maſs this? moſt exquiſitely form'd and adapted to the Office for which it was ordained, and with no leſs than infinite Wiſdom And yet, when we take 2 general ſurvey of the Works of the Creatjon, we find nothing made in vain; nothing ſuperfluous or redundant; and notwithſtanding this, all is performd (as Sir Iſaac Newton has clearly demonſtrated in his Principia) with mathemotical exactneſs  . That  That ſo large a Body was created for Ends proportionably great cannot be doubted; and its very ſituation is no ſmall indication of the ſame. What thoſe ends ãre, though it may be impoſſible ever to find them all out, yet, by proceeding with due caution, we may very probably be able to obtain ſufficient Data to conduct us to many uſeful Truths; and even when the Analogy appears true, and yet falls ſhort of a Demonſtration, it may then be put down by way of Interrogation or Quære, that the ſame thing may be farther enquired into by others.”  The next remarkable Characteriſtic relating to that glorious Object, and which is moſt obvious, are the Rays perpetually darting from him: This Phenomenon ſeems to indicate and point out his Office, viZ. that of a Circulator. For, as hinted above, as he is every moment emitting his Beams from all parts of his Body, it may rationally be concluded, that as conſtant a ſupply of the ſame elementary Fire will be thought abſolutely neceſſary in order to preſerve an Equilibrium.”  As in Mathematics there is no proceeding forward without proper Data, ſo it fares in Philoſophy; unleſs the Problem hath ſufficient Data, the Mathematician labours in vain, and can never inveſtigate his Theorem; no more can the Philoſopher without proper Requiſites inveſtigate his Theory.” lii  Arguing from Analogy is an approved method of inveſtigating the Knowledge of Things. Thiigs. Now the Body of Man has been thought by ſomæe of the moſt curious Obſervers of Nature to be analogous to the Syſtem of the World, and was thereſore termed the Mierocoſm, or World in miniature; to diſtinguiſhſãt from the Macrocoſm or great World. Let us then confider the Microcoſm, which we berſt underſtand. This minute World we know to be compoſed of Solids and Fluids, and to bæ full of Motion; and alſo that the motion of the ſolid parts (and conſequently that of the whole Machine) is from the effects of the motion of the bodily Fluids; for if their Motion be retarded in any degree, a proportionable defect is ſure to follow among the ſolids alſo; and whenever their motion entirely ceaſes, the whole Machine becomes motionleſs, inanimate and dead. EEEE  The next thing to be conſiderd is the phyſical cauſe of this natural motion of the bodily Fluids; which motion, we are well aſſured is performed by the Heart: An Engine or Inſtrument fitly contrived and adapted for that purpoſe, and placed in the moſt commodious part of the minute Syſtem for that End. s If then, I ſay, the ſureſt way to arrive at the Tmth is to argue from Analogy, i. e. from Things well known, to thoſe leſs known; the Macrocoſm, or great World is alſo well known to conſiſt of ſolids and fluids, and to bè replete vith a variety of Motions; which Motions; ] X  from  i ſ - m . — -_ Z from repeated obſervations appęar to be owing tò the effects oſ an active ætherial Fluid: This has heen oſten conjectured before, and inſiſted on by ſome of the greateſt and moſt eminent Philoſophers, particularly Sir Iſaac Newton, and Biſhop Berkheley; but as their Reaſoning could never be ſufficiently ſupported by proper Experiments before the late Difcoveries by Electricity, the Evidences they procuced were not properly regarded.”  From the ſame method of Reaſoning we are naturally conducted to the Sun, as a Circulator in the Macrocoſm, which (as we find by the effects of thoſe burning Mirrors) ſends forth ſuch plenty of a powerſul ætherial Fluid, or pure clementary Fire. llEti s Since then, by this method of Reaſoning, we compare great Things with ſmall, may not the Sun with ſufficient Propriety be termed the Cor Mundi, or the Heart of the World, ſimilar in its Office to the Heart in the Body, diſpenſing the ætherial Fluid to the utmoſt limits of the Syſtem? Particularly, when we conſider that ſuch a conſtant emiſſion of that ætherial Fluid from the Sun's Body muſt require as conſtant a ſupply; how that is performed I am now to enquire.  This Fluid, like the Blood in the Body, is from thence returned to maintain the Circulation: For as the Blood in the Microcoſm is by the force of the Heart protruded to the utmoſt limits of the minute Syſtem, and when l c jt it can proceed no farther returns back to the Heart again to keep up and maintain the Circulation; ſo, if the Analogy holds good, the ætherial Medium in the Macrocoſm when protruded to the utmoſt limits of the Syſtem of the World, and can proceed no farther, returns in like manner back to the Sun to maintain the Circulation; by what means ſuch a Return is effected in the Macrocoſm, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew.” s According to the modern Aſtronomy, every fixed Star is of the ſame Nature and performs the ſame Office that the Sun does in our ſolar Syſtem, which opinion is ſupported by many rational Arguments, ſome of which are the following. s Firſt, The Light of the fixed Stars is not a borrow'd Light, like that of the Planets; but innate, as that of the Sun.” s Secondly, Their diſtance is ſo immenſely great, as to afford no perceptible annual ParalIax, that is, ſo great that the diſtance of 1-2 Millions of Miles (equal to the diameter of the Earth's annual Orbit) nearer or farther from them, makes no ſenſible difference in their Altitude; neither does a celeſtial Teleſcope, which magnifies ſeveral hundreds of times, make any diterence as to their magnitude, which are undoub®æed Indications that their diſtance is immenſely great: And conſequently,, e Thirdly, If the Sun were placed at the ſame vaſt diſtance, it would appear like ſuch X 2  another another lucid point,  Every fixed Star then, being allowd to bo the Centrè of a Syſtem of Planets and Comets, performing the ſame Office as the viſible Sun, and like that perpetually darting off its radiant Beams, to the utmoſt boundaries of each reſpective Syſtem and far beyond; the conſequence muſt be that the profound Abyſs, or what is by ſome termd the immenſe void, is moſt replete with æEther of all other parts, ĩ. e. that part of Space, which we thought the moſt void and empty, contains the greateſt fullneſs, and the denſeſt Ather, i. e. the farther from thoſe ſeveral grand Luminaries, the more denſe ĩt is conceived to be.  To render this yet more plain and intelligible, ſee Plate II. which will convey a more clear Idea than a multitude of Words: Where S, at the Centre repreſents the Sun: The 6 concentric Circles, the ſeveral Orbits of the Planets. The ſmall Lines or ſtrait Strokes, the ſolar Rays. The ſame is to be underſtood of all the ſurrounding ſolar Syſtems.”  Theſe Things conſidered, let us hear Sir Iſaac Newton himſelſ.  Every Body,” he ſays,  endeavours to go from the denſer part of the  Medium towards the rarer3 And if this  Medium be rarer within the Suns Body than  at his Surface, and rarer there than at the  hundredth part of an Inch from its Body,  and rarer there than at the fiſtieth of an Inch  from its Body, and rarer there than at the  Orb  u -     Orb of Saturn; I ſee no reaſon why the ins creaſe of denſity ſhould ſtop any where, and not rather be continued through all Diſtances  from the Sun to Saturn and beyond. And  though this increaſe of Denſity may, at great e diſtances, be exceeding ſlow, yet if the elaſtic  Force of this Medium be exceeding great, it  may ſuffice to impel Bodies from the denſer  parts of this Medium towards the rarer with  all that Power which we call Gravity. And : that the elaſtic Force of this Medium is exceeding great may be gathered from the ſwiftneſs of its Vibrations Optics, Qu. æI.  Theſe Things, though delivered as a Query, muſt be allowed to be his real Sentiments, as is manifeſt from the Advertiſement in the 2d. and later Editions of his Optics, where he acquaints us, that æ to ſhew he did not take  Gravity for an eſſential Property of Bodies, he  had added one Queſtion concerning its Cauſe, s chooſing to propoſe it by way of a Queſtion, s becauſe he was not then ſatisfied about it  for want of Experiments ſa].”  Thus far Sir Iſaac's Opinion ſeems to coincide exactly with the preſent Plan. Since then it appears reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the farther the ſolar Rays proceed from him, the L c c La c   (a) This therefore, for want of Experiments to prove it, we ſhall conſider is in Theory only; as we ſhall likewiſe the plurality of Solar Syſtems abovementioned, (notwithſtanding it is an allowd Doctrine) but it ought alſo to he conſidered that the latter corroborates and ſtrengthens the former; and eſpecially, ſince it appears natural. more more denſe they are, conſequently, when they have gone on ſo far as to meet with thoſe Rays from the neareſt ſolar Syſtems around them, they muſt in thoſe far diſtant Regions be denſeſt of all. Is it not then natural to conclude, that at ſõ denſe a part of an extremely elaſtic Medium, it muſt from thence return again to the moſt rare part from whence it was ſent, and in iĩis progreſs, cauſe the centripetal Force of the Planets, i. e. that Force which cauſes them to gravitate towards the Sun? Hence a Circulation in the Macrocoſm appears as agreeable to Reaſon, as a Circulation in the Microcoſm; and that Gravity is performed by an impelling Force. Is it not reaſonable alſo to ſuppoſe, that ſuch a gradual increaſe of the denſity of the ther from the Sun to the utmoſt limits of the Syſtem, is the true mechanical Cauſe, why Saturn in the denſer part of the Medium moves ſ=lower than Jupiter in a rarer; and again, Jupiter than Mars, Mars than the Earth ? &e.  What a complete, glorious, and ſtupendous piece of Machinery then is the Solar Syſtem How much more ſo is the whole frame of Nature And how conſummate the PowER, the WisnoMm, and the GooDNESS of the Divine and Incomprehenſible Architect of the Univerſe Ei  Hence there appears a more general Cauſe of Motion in the World than what has been hitherto ſuppoſed, and an adequate method to render the centripetal Forces of the Planets and Comets intelligible and rational.” The  The Solar 85ſtem then may not improperly be conſidered as a concave Sphere, where the greateſt denſity or ſpring is concęived to be at the Surface or Circumference, and preſſing from every individual part of it towards the Sun or CentreIf Enquiries are purſued on this plan, they muſt neceſſarily terminate in an univerſal Plenum of the ſame elementary Fire. GCOHESION. i OHE SION, in Phyſicks, is the action whereby the Particles or primary Corpuſcles, whereof natural Bodies conſiſt, are connected or bound together, ſo as to form Particles; and thoſe again kept together, ſo as to form ſeveral Maſſęs or Bodies.  The Cauſe of this Coheſion or nexus materiæ has extremely perplex'd the Philoſophers of all Ages. In all Syſtems of Phyſicks Matter is ſuppoſed orginally to be in minute indiviſible Atoms. lll s Flow and by what Principle theſe ſeveral and diſtinct Corpuſcles ſhould come firſt joined and combined into little Syſtems; and how they ſhould come to perſevere in that ſtate of union is a poiĩt of the moſt difficulty, and even of the moſt importance of any in Phyſicks ?  The moſt popular Opinion is that ſo ſtrenuouſly defended by J. Bernoulli ae gravitate Tlilli -  Atheris,  L L llE theris, vho accounts for the Cobefion of the parts of matter, from the uniform preſſure of the Atmoſphere: Confirming this Doctrine from the known Experiment of two poliſhed marble Planes, which cohere very ſtrongly in the open Air, but eaſily drop aſunder in an exhauſted receiver. But though this Theory might ſerve tolerably well to explain the Cobeſion of compoſitions, or greater collections of matter; yet it falls ſhort of accounting for that firſt Coheſion of the Atoms, or primitivè Corpuſcles, whereoſ the Corpuſcles of. hard Bodies are compoſed.” Sir Iſaac Newton delivers his Doctrine of oheſion thus:  The particles of all hard, homogeneous Bodies which touch one another, cobere with a great Force; to account for which, ſome Philoſopers have recourſe to a kind of hooked Atoms, which in effect, is nothing elſe, but to beg the thing in queſtion. Others imagine, that the particles of Bodies are connected by reſt, i. e. in effect, by nothing at all; and others by conſpiring motions, i. e. by a relative reſt among themſelves. For myſelf, it rather appears to me, that the particles of Bodies cobere by an attractive Force; whereby they tend mutually towards each other; which Force, in the very Point of contact, is very great; at little diſtances is leſs; and at a little farther diſtance is quite inſenſiblee. Now if cOmpound Bodies be ſo hard, as by experience c we  we ſind ſome of them to be, and yet have a great many hidden pores within them, and conſiſt of parts only Iaid together; nò doubt thoſe ſimple particles which have no pores within thern, and which were never divided into parts, muſt be vaſtly harder. s For fuch Hard particles gathered into a maſs, cannot poſſibly touch in more than a few points; and therefore much leſs force is required to fever them, than to break a ſolid particle whoſe parts touch throughout all their ſurfaces, without any intermediate pores or interſtices. But how ſuch hard particles only laid together, and touching only in a few points ſhould come to cohere ſo firmly, as in fact we find they do, is inconceivable, unleſs there be ſome cauſe whereby they are attracted and preſſed together.”  Now the ſmalleſt particles of matter may cobere by the ſtrongeſt Attractions, and conſtitute larger, whoſe attracting force is feebler: And again, many of theſe larger particles cobering may conſtitute others ſtill larger, whoſe attractive force is ſtill weaker; and ſo on for ſeveral ſucceſfions, till the progreſſion end in the biggeſt particles, on which the operations in Chymiſtry and the Colours of natural Bodies do depend; and which by cobering compoſe Bodies of a ſenſible magnitude.” The different degrees of Cobeſion conſtitute odies of different forms and properties hus the ſame great Author obſerves, the j Y : par- articles of fluids, which do not cobhere 1 on ly, and àrè ſmall enough to r s r ũſcep ptibl of thoſe agitations ſ ꝶ Ieep ꝶ iti a fluor, are moſt ealily ſepa. trated and rarefied into vapour, and make &hãt Chymiſts call volatile Bodies, rarefying : ſ an eaſy heat, and again condenſing t  à moderate cold.”  Thoſe, hoſe particles are groſſer, and ſo  leſs ſuſceptible of agitation, or cohere by a c ſtronger Attraction, are not ſeparable without  a greater degree of heat, and ſome of them  not without fermentation; and theſe m.  what the Chymiſts call ſixt Bodies— Sce Chambers under the Word Coheſion.

Of the-truth of this poſition we are certain; ſince it is undeniably proved by Experiments in general to be obtain'd from the pores of groſs Bodies; and that which Ieaves us ſtill leſs Reaſon to doubt is, that although it be real and true Fire, yet we obtain it with the greateſt eaſe and in the greateſt plenty, from nothing (Metals excepted) ſõ much as from Watero.

To effect which, it is neceſſary to premiſe what we find confirmed by a variety of electrical Experiments, particularly by many that are contain'd in Chap. 3d. of the iſt. part; viz. that of a Y 2 ſubtile   niBourth Goſl; ſieladheſũtr õf the tonſtitũ pesio oſ which heing ſil icię enæꝶ four ees of hieattò taſte degi heat n yiu o1Fifth.

Mr. Macquer ſuppoſes with great proba-: bility, that the Metal owes its name to this laſt roperty, as, derived from the word Plata, which in Spaniſh ſignifies Silver,... The name of white gold, which has likewiſe been given to, this metal ariſes out of certain properties, which alſo belong to gold, ſuch as to be nearly of the ſame ſpecific gravity as' gold; to reſiſt like that the acion of Sulphur, Lead, Antimony, the royal Cement, and all pure Acids; and to ſubmit, like gold, to no ſolvent but Aqua-regia, and Hepar sul huris. / z of i of the Chemiſts without much alteration: No Heat was yet diſcoverd ſufficient for the purpoſe, till one more active than the reſt was thought of, which when properly applied was found to effect a complete fuſion: The Agent I mean is that of the Solar Fire collected in the focus of a burning glaſs, by which means it was fuſed, and thereby renderd a perfect metal, no metal being truly perfect till ĩt is ſo malleable as to ſpread under the hammer: This was diſcoverd by that ingenious Chemiſt Mr. Macquer, of the French Academy, and may be found in his chemical Dictionary under the word Platina: So that with the addition of this metal, together with that of water, we have nine Bodies in form of Metals, which will require nine different degrees of heat to deſtroy, and as many to reſtore their reſpective Coheſions. i On MAGNE TISM. AVING in the briefeſt manner treated, Firſt, on the Cauſe of Motion; Secondly, of Gravity: And Thirdly, of Coheſion: I ſhall next endeavour, in the the ſame brief manner to ſhew the Cauſe of Magnetiſm: But the Phenomena exhibited in Magnetiſm are more untractable and difficult than either of the former; and the cauſe, or rather the manner or mode of jts acting ſeems farther out of our reach. There can be, however, little doubt, hut that ——— that the Phenomena are effects produced from the ſame cauſe in a different mode or dreſs: In that form it appears more ſubtile and active than in any other. This was the reaſon of my calling it Spirit of æther, and uſing Lord Bacon's appellation, Pneuma. My firſt hint concerning the cauſe of Magnetiſm was from the Phenomena afforded by vertical Bars of Iron, which, by means of that poſition, were obſerved to acquire a magnetical virtue. That Phenomenon ſeemd firſt to be taken notice of by Mr. Boyle. See his Philoſophy, abridg'd by Mr. Shav, Vol. L. p. 498. A Recapitulation of the Experiment may be ſeen in a Note. See Eſſays, p. 78. ſect. 158. and p. 407. where that Author, after ſpeaking of the Magnetiſm acquired by the iron Bars of Windows, or any other that have ſtood a conſiderable time in a vertical poſition, ſays,  I have found, indeed, that if a Bar of Iron,  which has not ſtood long in an erect poſture,  be but held perpendicular, the ſame Experi-  ments will ſucceed; but then this virtus, ? diſplayd by the extreams of the Iron, will  be ſo tranſient, that if the Bar be but invert-  ed, and held again upright, that end which  juſt before was uppermoſt, and drew the  north point of the Needle, will now, being  lowermoſt, drive it away; which will not  happen to a Bar that has been for ſome years  kept in that poſition. From various Obſervations nothing can apZz 2 pear pear much more obvious and plain than that Magnetiſm is acquired by means of a moſt ſubtile active fluid, which pervades the pores of thoſe iron vehicles, and which are capable not only of acquiring by that means a magnetiſm themſelves, but likewiſe of communicating a ſtill greater magnetiſm to other iron Bars, which vill more plainly appear a little farther on, when I come to treat of the manner of the conſtruction of artificial Magnets. According to former obſervations, Motion. Gravitation, Coheſion, &c. are all of them different Phenomena produced by the ſame identical cauſe; and no reaſonable doubt can be made but that the cauſe of magnetiſm is the ſame univerſal ſubtile elaſtic &ther, acting ĩn a ſtill different form. That the magnetic virtue, the electrical virtue, the Fire of Lightning are all of them one and the ſame Princile, under different forms, cannot be reaſonably doubted, ſince the effects from each ate the ſame; magnetic polarity, for inſtance, ĩs evidently generated in iron Bars by means of ihe fubtile elaſtic fluid conſtantly paſſing through them. Dr. Franklin has preſented us with a method to give ſuch a polarity to common Needles as to cauſe them to traverſe when laid on water; and informs us that it was a frequent Experiment at Philadelphia to give a polarity to Needles by only paſſing the electrical flaſh through them.:o that the ſame efſects are produced by  by a ſlath of electrical Fire as from a flaſ of Lightning. By flaſhes of Lightning Capt. Woaddel's Compaſſes either loſt the virtue of the Loadſtone, or elſe the poles were reverſed, the North point turning towards the South. We are now, however, demonſtrably certain, that we were egregiouſly miſtaken, when we imagined every Magnet to be endued with Poles, an Axis, and an Equator, in a ſimilar manner with the Earth itſelf. I ſhall therefore deſiſt from any farther enquiry into the nature of it, leaving it to the explanation of Time and Experience; and ſhall conclude this account of natural Magnets with what is, if poſſible, yet more abſtruſe and unintelligible, viZ. the manner of conſtructing artificial ones. ArTIFICIAL M AGNETS. ss r TVHE RE have been ſeveral methods ſ propoſed for making artificial Magmnets; but none has yet met with s greater Succeſs than that of Mr. Canton; a  Gentleman well known to the learned world,  and to vhom we owe the Diſcovery.” The Proceſs. s Procure a dozen of Bars, s ſix of ſoft Steel, each to be three Inches  long, one quarter of an Inch broad, and onæ  twentieth of an Inch thick; with two pieces  of Iron, each half the length of one of the æ Bars, but of the ſame breadth and thickneſs; s alſo ſix pieces of hard Steel, each five Inches t and  and an half long, half an Ineh broad; and three twentieths of an Inch thick; with two ieces of Iron of half the length, but the whole breadth and thickneſs of one of the hard Bars; and let all the Bars be murked with a line quite round them at one end. Then take an iron Poker and Tongs, or two Bars of Iron, the larger they are and the longer they have been uſed; the better; and fixing the Poker upright between the knees, hold to it, near the top, one of the ſoſt Bars (having its marked end downwards) by æ piece of ſewing Silk, which muſt be pulſed tight by the left hand, that the Bar may not ſlide; then graſping the Tongs with the right hand, a little below the middle, and holding them nearly in a vertical poſition, let the Bar be ſtroked by the lower end from the bottom to the top, about ten times on each ſide, which will give it a magnetic Power ſufficient to lift a ſmall key at the marked end ſa); which end, if the Bar was ſuſpended on a point, would turn toward the north, and is therefore called the north Pole, and the unmarked end is for the ſame reaſon called the ſouth Pole. Four of the ſoft Bars being impregnated after this manner, lay the two, parallel to each other, at the diſtance of one fourth of an Inch, between the two pieces of Iron belonging to them, a north (n) Here the Tongs and Poer may be put by as uſeleſ;, ere being no ſarther occaſion ſor them in the Proceſs. c and and a ſouth Pole againſt each piece of Iron; then take two of the four Bars already made magnetical, and place them together, ſo as to make a double Bar in thickneſs, the north Pole of one even with the ſouth Pole of tche other; and the remaining two being put to theſe, one on each ſide, ſo as to have two north and two ſouth Poles together: Separate the north from the ſouth Poles at one end, by a large pin, and place them perpendicularly with that end downwards on the middle of one of the parallel Bars, the two north Poles towards its ſouth, and the two ſouth Poles towards its north end: Slide them backward, and forward, three or four times the whole length of the Bar, and removing them from the middle of this, place them on the middle of the other Bar, as before directed, and go over that in the ſame manner; then turn Dboth the Bars the other ſide upwards, and repeat the former operation; this being done, take rhe two from between the pieces of Iron, and placing the two outermoſt of the touching Bars in their room, let the other two be the outermoſt of the four to touch theſe with; and this Proceſs being repeated till each pair of Bars have been touched three or four times over, which will give them a conſiderable magnetic Power; put the half doZen together after the manner of the four, and touch with them two pair of the hard Bars placed between their Irons, at the diſtance of about  half J —/5-4ſſililimm —I /T;/sm,©~ix half an Inch from each other; then lay the ſoft Bars aſide, and with the four hard ones let the other two be impregnated, holding the touching Bars apart at the lower end near two tenths of an Inch, to which diſtance let them he ſeparated after they are ſet on the parallel Bar and brought together again before they are taken off: This being obſerved proceed according to the method deſcribed above, till each pair have been touched two or three times over; but as this vertical way of touching a Bar will not give it quite ſo much of the magnetical virtue as it will receive, let each pair be now touched once or twice over in their parallel poſition between the Irons, with two of the Bars held horizontally or nearly ſo, by drawing at the ſame time the north of one from the middle over the ſouth end, and the ſouth of the other from the middle over the north end of a parallel Bar; then bringing them to the middle again without touching the parallel Bar, give three or four of theſe horiZzontal ſtrokes to cach ſide. The horiZontal touch after the vertical will make the Bars as ſtrong as they poſſibly can be made, as appears by their not receiving any additional ſtrength when the vertical touch is given by a great number of Bars, and the horizontal by thoſe of a ſuperior magnetic Power. This whole Proceſ may be gone through in about half an hour; and each of the large Bars, if well hardened, lli ? s may  - Jmm- -;;= ]—]//3m SS S _nlll— — may be mãde tò lift twenty eight Troy Ounces, and ſometimes more. And when theſe Bars are thus impregnated, they will give to ati hard Bar of the ſame ſiæe its full viſtue in leſs than two iiinutes; and therefore will anſwer all the purpoſes of Magnetiſm in Nãvigationanũ experimental Philoſophy much better thãn the Loadſtone, which is known not to have a ſuſficient Power to impregnate hard Bãtrs.The half dozen being put into ⸗ caſe, ũn ſuch a manmẽr as that to Poles of the ſamè denominhation may not be together, and their Itons with them as one Bar, they will retain the virtue they have received; but if ãhitir Power ſhould, by making Experiments; be ever ſo impaired, ĩit may be reſtored without any forẽign aſſiſtance in a few minutes. And if, oũt of curioſity, a much larger ſet of Bars ſhould be required, theſe will eommunicate to them a fufficient Power to proceed with, and they may in a ſhort time, by the ſame method, bè brought to their ful ſtrength.-Vd i l a ...;   xxx æ  x iõoſ n x æ ) 75157 anil Elii Juæ i 4.

Aũthors own Norration of hls EXpetimeni A.Iſhould think I pòſeſsbut/a very ſinall ſharę of Curioſity were it not excited byſuch anextraordinary account as the electricity of Stockings.. The following is a Tranſcript of thoſe PAapero..: jil P A P E R IL Read VFebruary iſt. 1759.  7 had for ſome time obſerved, that upon I pulling off my Stockings at night, they made a crackling or ſnapping noiſe; and in the dark Icould perceive them to emit ſparks of Fire: I made no doubt but that this proceeded from àa principle of Electricity; and I was confirmed in this Opinion, by obſerving, that;; in Weather favourable for electrical Experiments, thoſe Appearances were morẽ remarkable than at other times. I mentioned this Obſervation to ſeveral of my Friends, andſ fome of them told me, they likewiſe had often perceived the ſnapping and emiſſion of Fire from their Stockings upon pulling them off, eſpecially in the Winter nights: But I couldnot hear of any Body that had taken this PHenomenon into Conſiderãtion in a philoſophical way For my own part, I could not but think, that ſo ſtriking an appearance, one that ſeems to have an immediate connexion with the human Body, or is at leaſt as much about us as the Cloaths we wear, Aa 2 and if you ill have patience to hear the ingenions and is obvious to the perception sẽq Bęnſes, merited not only à philoſophicãl attntipũ, but the ſtricteſt Enquity, poſſible,. ſ I was the more induced to.ſuch an enqiſity, asit ſeeaed to me to open a new path ſor ꝑroceeding inelectrical Reſearches,, and rſight perhaps throw new light on the great and ſrpriſing diſcoveries already made in that branch of natural Philoſophy. The ſimplicity of the Apparatus, and great facility in making the proper Experiments, putting it in my power to begin and carry on my enquiry at pleaſure, Ientered upon ſomewhat of a regũlar courſe of obſervations about the beginning of November laſt; and ſince that time havẽ purſued it as cloſely as my Leiſure and the Weather, which has been far from favourablẽ for electrical Experiments, would permit. It iĩs the purpoſe of this, and of thoſe Papers that may follow, to lay before the Royal Society an account oſ the Experiments and Obſervations I have already made, or may hereaſter be able to make, in the progreſs of this enquiry. li7òſã firſt endeavour was to diſcover what ſort of Stockings was moſt proper to piodue Electricity, in order to determine this, I'tried ſingle Stockings of different kinds, vi?. Thread, Cotton, Silk and Worſted, putting them on, and wearing them ſome time. On pulling them off, I could perceive nothing of Electricity  ſ tt ar⸗ ⸗ uti may be proper tꝗ hę a little more expſũcit. ſ I muſt therefore obſerve, that stt an rſtèd, being in themſeſltes electric, arè hoth of them, eſpecially Silk, extremely ſuſceptible of Elecrricity. I have ſometimes obſerved, particularly when the Weather was favourablè, that Sil when but barely handled, này, when hutfſimply touched, has become elęctrical where it had been handled or toucd, ãs appeared by its attracting little light Balls ſuſpended by Threads. It cannot therefore be ſuppòſed that Silk or Worſted Stockings can bè put >pon the Leg, without being excited to à ſenſible degree of Electricity. And thence it is, that when taken off they are ſometimes perceived to ſnap though worn ſingle. But hatever Electricity the ſingle Stockings acquires by friction or otherwiſe, it immediately loſes it upon being ſeparated from the Leg: If any celectric Virtue remains, it is no more than what belongs to it as an electric ſubſtance ceaſing to be excited; and it is in ſo ſimall a degreę, as in the preſent caſe not to merit attention. In general, when I ſpeak of the Electricity in queſtion, I mean ſuch a Power ofElectricity as is obvious, and perceptiBle to the ſenſes, ſo that the Stockings, after being taken off, ſould appear more or Ieſs inflated; throw out an electrical Wind to be felt by the hare Leg; attract or repel another Stocking Dvviſi- 'r a:0 viſibly ; and, upòn the touch, na. and emi it or. receive electrical Fire. After making the Ex xpmu; ; ove- u tioned with ſingle stockings, I otes: try the effect of two Stockings upon one This I did with two of thread, i næ i and ſilk ſucceſſively; but this produced no electrical appearance more than hefore. I then combined them one with another, and, running through all the different changes, I found that none of thoſe I then made uſe of exhibited viſible proofs of Electricity, but the ſilk and worſted together; and there, indeed, the electric power appeared remarkably ſtrong. Tt ſeemed to be a matter of indifferenece whether the ſilk or the worſted were uppermoſt, the combination of the two was what I judged to be eſſential; and happening at that time to wear ſilk Stockings with thin worſted under them, I kept to the uſe of theſe, and ſound it a convenient Circumſtance in the courſe of my Experiments. As ſome may have the curioſity to examine the Obſervations I preſent them with, by Experiments of their own making; before I proceed further, I ſhall furniſh them with a few Remarks, which may enable them to make their Experiments with more eaſe and certainty than if they ſet out unacquainted with ſome Circumſtances, which I have learnt from Experience. One of the fſirſt things to be attended to ĩs the et hich has. an. Influence on ll ectric Experiments, hut ſupon⸗ none more than thoſę which relate to this branch of Elęetricity.. The. moſt favourable weather is ſthut which is dry and clear, and if a little froſty, fo much the better. In general, when the quickſilver in the Barometer riſes, and the Fireburns remarkably briſk and clear, ve may expecta conſiderable appearance of Electricity; ãat other times, ĩt is better. not to attempt the Experiment. Ia Db2mn 351: When the Weather is favourable, it is not neceſſary to wear the Stockings all day: Thut, indeed, raiſes the electrical Power to the higheſt degree; yet, provided they be dry and made warm by the Fire,, before they are put upon the Leg, their continuance upon it for æ ſhort time prepares them ſufficiently for exhibiting viſible Proofs of Electricity. If this ſhoũld not anſwer upon the firſt trial, the Operation may be repeated two or three times to bring them into a proper diſpoſition to receive the electrical virtue; and this is no more than what is found to be. ſometimes neceſſary with reſpect to gſaſe Globes and Tubes, eſpecially when new. If the Stockings have once. acquired this diſpoſition, they retain it for the day, or until. a change of weather, and the Experiment may be repeated with ſucceſs as often as one pleaſes; for no ſooner are they diſcharged of their Electricity, than they are ready to receive it anew: nay, if ſpeedily returned upon the Leg, ther lil lll catch ders them capable of anſwering expectation in uch Experiments as I have occaſion to make. ſa I now return to my ſubject.T Thè Opinion I had conceived, that the combinãtion of ſilk and worſted was neceſſary for the production of Electricity, ſeemed to meet with confirmation from àll the Experiments I made with the Stockings I then wore. I was at that time in mourning, ſo that my ſilk Stockings were black, and under them I conſtantly wore thin white worſted. About the latter end of November I went out of mourning, and of courſe changed the colour of my Stockings. On the ſecond of December, having put on a pair of white ſilk above the worſted, aſter T had wore them ſome hours, I reſolved to amuſe myſelf with a few Experiments. The Weather was remarkably favourable, and I'had reaſon to expect a fine appearance of Electricity; but upon taking off my Stockings, and pulling them aſunder, to my great aſtoniſiment, I found they diſcovered no ſigns of electrical Power: As I held them in my hands thèy hung down collapſed, and did not more attract one another than before they were put upon my leg. I repeated the Experiment two Or three times, but with. no better Succeſ. n 4  uã  ſ(a) An Improvement may- periaps be made upon this, by getting a piece of Silk or Worſted, knit, or wove in a Stocking Lbom, ſo that withbut being cut it may be formed Anio the ſhape of long Mittens or Sleeves, or rather what ve call a ſilk or worſted Tube, &e. llilũ Bb An - ] l lil 88) ny©it; ' : TEIN ſ ĩ » SEEEsSLE i ſ I An Event I ſo litſle expected diſconcerted me much. I ſaw I was no longer to aſcribe Electricity to the conbination of ſilk and worſted; But I remained at a loſs to know to what I ſhould aſcribe it. At laſt, upon conſidering the Circumſtance of this and other Experiments; à conjecture occurred, that the Electricity in might depend upon the nature of diferent colours. In order to determine this, I thought it faireſt to make the trial in the ſamẽè ſubſtances. Accordingly I had recourſe to the following Experiment. illih I took a pair of white ſilk Stockings, and having warmed them at the Fire put them both upon the ſame leg. After I had worn them about ten minutes, I took them off, ànd pulled them aſunder, but diſcovered no ſigns of Electricity in either. I did the ſame with a pair of black ſilk, but to no other effect. I then proceeded to the deciſive trial. I put a black and a white Stocking upon my leg, and wore them likewiſe ten minutes. I waited with ſome impatience to ſee the ſucceſs of my Experiment, and in return had the ſatisfaction of obſerving, upon their being pulled aſunder, that each of them had acquired a ſtronger degree of Electricity than I had before ſeen: they were inflated ſo much, that each of them ſhewed the entire ſnape of the leg, and at the diſtance of a foot and an half they ruſhed to meet each other. I went through the ſame Experiment with worſted Stockings, and found that, as & - as in ſilk, nothing but the combination of black and white produded Electricity. As I had often experiencęd the Power of Electricity in the. combination of black ſilk with white is æd Stockings, there remained to try hut rhat of white ſilk with black worſted, which anſwered as I expected, and ſeemed to complete the Demonſtrationn. rii. A Phenomenon ſo new, and of ſo curious a nature as theſe Experiments preſented, could not but for ſome time engage my attention., P A P E RII. um b, Read May 17th. 1759. n' i T N my former Paper, I gave the Society I an account of ſome Experiments made vuwithſilk and worſted Stockings, by which it appeared, that the remarkable degree of Electricity they had acquired by being put upon 1he leg depended on their being of different colours, namely, black and white. I did not then, nor do I yet take upon me to detormine the cauſe of this Pnenomenon. Whether. it be owing to light, which is the origin of coIours, or only to the ingredients which enter into the compoſition. of ſeveral Dyes; or to thoſe conjunctly with the colours they produce; in any of theſe views the matter is curious, and æqually merits a careful enquiry.But I fear the ſolution of this, and of many other diſfiau ; Bbb 2 cult. Va me to obſervę; that it runs thipugh the whole of that bianeh, which I have at preſent under xamination, and to which I return... Wihitę Silk differs;much in Electricity ſrom black Silk. When the whitę Stocking is drawn ſeparatel; upon the Hand, no crackling is heard no: ſparks of Fite ſegn in the dark let it be pulled backwards and forwards ever ſo often: when another white Stocking is drawn on above it notliing more ajpears; and when ſeparate from the hand, neither of them diſcovers any ſigns of Electricity; excepting, that when brought within a fei Inches of the Electrometer, they attract and repel the balls a littlee. T ſatcad of to yhit or tmo bluck tockings, one white, nd orr that a black ſtocking be drawn upon thę hand, they diſcover not the Ieaſt- ſigns of Electricity while they continue npon the hand, even th ough they ſhould be drawn backwards and forwards upon it ſeveral times; nor when taken together from the hand and preſented to the Electrometer do they appear to have acquired any more than a ſmall degree of Electricity.. They muſt be brought within the diſtance of a foot, nay, ſometimes of a few inches, before they have any effect upon the balls; but the moment they are ſeparated, they are found to be both of them highly electrified, the white poſitively, and the black negatively. The Circumſtances that appear the moſt to merit Obſervation are as follows: i Virſt, S—r  43;; —/ —— - paque tube, and acting, the one poſitively, the other negatively at full as great a diſtance, andas forcibly as the tubes. .n Thirdly. Both the Stockings, when held at a diſtance from one another, appear inflated to ſuch a degree, that, when highly electrified, they give the entire ſhape of the Leg; and when brought near the Face, or any naked part of the Body, there is a ſenſation felt, as ifa cool wind was blown upon that partt. When the two white, or two black are held together by the extremities, they repel one another, and form an angle, ſeemingly of 30 or 35 degrees. VFourthly. When a white and a black Stocking are preſented to each other, they mutually attract, with a force anſwerable to the degree of Electricity they have acquired: when brought within the diſtance of three feet, they uſually incline towards one another, within two and an half, or two feet they catch hold of each other; and when brought nearer, they ruſh together with ſurpriſing violence. As th approach, their inflation gradually ſubſides, and their attraction of foreign objects diminiſhes: When they meet, they flatten, and join as cloſe together, as if they were ſo many folds of ſilk; and then the balls of the Electrometer are not affected at the diſtance of a foot, nor even of a few inches at certain times. But what appears moſt extraordinary is, that when they are ſeparated, and removed at a ſufficient diſtance pear to have been in the leaſt impaired by the ſhtck they had in meeting. They are again inflated, again attract, and fepel, and are as ready to ruſh together as before ſa)J. When this Experiment is performed with two black Stockings in one hand, and two white in the other, it exhibits a very curious ſpectacle: The repulſion of thoſe of the ſame colour, and the attraction of thoſe of different colours throws them into an agitation that is not unentertaining, and makes them catch each at that of its oppoſite colour, at a greater diſtance than one would expect.

When they are ſeparated from one another, they loſe their power very ſoon, much as the excited Tube does; but when they are together they will retain it for an hour or two   (a) The Phenomena, here remarked, of the black Stocking and the white when electrified, namely, that as they approach one another, their attractive and repulſive force decreaſe with regard to foreign objects, but increaſe ſurpriſingly with regard to each other, and that their Electricity ſuſfers no diminution from the ſhock of their congreſs appear to me to be obſervations new in Electricity, and to merit attention. They ſeem to point out a retentive power of Electricity, which takes place between electrics, and electrics only; and which, I apprehend, may be found to be the cauſe of many curitus and ſingular Phenomena.

In this, and in ſome other reſpects, there appears to be ſuch a reſemblanc& between the Leyden Phial, or the electrical Pane of Glaſs, àud the black Stocking in conjunction with the white, eſpecially when the one is within the other, that T have been induced to conſider them both in the ſame light In bbth caſes, the poſitive Electricity is on the one ſide, and the negative on the other; ãnd the Stõckings as well as the Phial, and the Pane of Glaſs arè at once electrified poſitively and negatively. In both caſes there is an accumulation of Electricity, and a retention of ũt, far beyond what is to be met with in a ſimple body, electric or non-electric,. There is, however, a very remarkable-difference between them in two reſpects. In the Phial, and in the Panc of Glaſs, an exploſion is always obtained by conying on a cõmmunication between tle twõ fides by the interpoſition of à non-electric; but in the caſe of the black Siock- .  muumirt——t  æturmſ; æ~æ Stocking: and: thę, whitę, Inever yet ha⸗ beęn able to pruſ/ an exploſũ nos ſo ⸗ v 55 by any means I could think of,: whilę àhę one. was within the othet.

When the Stockings, are. ſeparated, and in the dark, upon preſenting to them the point of one's finger, or any ſmall metallie body, round. at the end, they exhibit the appearance of electrioal fire or li ght, according io the negative or poſitive ſtatę of the Stocking the: object is preſented to. With:the black at the diliance of two or threę inches, there. appęꝶ© to dart from the end of one's finger. a ſprig or penil, as it were, of fiery ſpaiks, which dilates in its progreſs, and ſtrikes againſt the. ſurface of the Stocking, at the ſame time a crackling orſnapping noiſe is heard. When the firſtdiſcharge is made, upon preſenting he finger as æ Apeedy diſc n    ( 200) finger to a freſh part of the Stocking, the ſame Phenomenon is repeated till you have traverſed the whole length of the Stocking, which, when the finger moves ſlowly, uſually vields eight or ten diſtinct diſcharges, before it is diveſted of its Electricity. With regard to the white Stocking, the ſame appearances hold, but with this difference, that, inſtead of ſparks of fire iſſuing from the finger, a little globule of white or bluiſh light is ſeen at the point of it; and, when the Electricity is ſtrong, that little body of light ſeems to break in an exploſion between the ſtocking and the finger; and rather a hiſſing than a crackling noiſe is heard. Seventhly. The electrical Phial may be charged by the ſtockings either poſitively or negatively, according as the wire from the neck of the Phial is preſented to the white or the black; and in the one, or the other caſe, the hiſſing or the crackling noiſe is louder than when any common wire or non-electric body is preſented: but if the Electricity of the white Stockings be thrown into the Phial, and upon that the Electricity of the black, or vice verſu; in that caſe, the Phial will not be electrified at all. The charging of the Phial was among the firſt of my Experiments with electrified ſtockings. By ſome trials I made in the month of December laſt, I found it would ſucceed. One froſty evening in that month, having thrown into a ſmall Phial, filled with quickſilver, the Electricity of one black Stocking, I received li from v1bu  junꝗ; *9 - u finger. With the Electricity or two ſtockings, the blow reached both my Elbows; and by the means of four, I kindled ſpirits oF Wine in a Tea- ſpoon, which I held in my hand, and, at the ſame time, I'felt the blow from my elbows to my breaſt. It may not, however, bè improper to obſerve, that the Electricity, in this caſe, was excited by means of the Leg. From what has been ſaid in the preceding Pages it is evident, that all the remarkable appearances of Electricity, hitherto diſcovered, may be exhibited by a ſimple Apparatus of black and white Sil. But this is not all, in the courſe of Experiments above- mentioned, ſomething curious has occurred to my obſervation, of which I do not find that any notice has been taken by others. What I mean is a ſtrong Coheſion produced by Electricity. But as this Paper is already extended to a great length, I ſhall reſerve the account of electrical Coheſion for another, which I ſhall ſoon have the honour of preſenting to the Society.” P A P E R1IIL Of Electrital Cobeſion. ] Read June 21ſt. 1759. 3 CCORDING to what I promiſed A in the concluion of my lIaſt Paper, I come in this to give the Society an acfrom the Exploſion a ſmart Blow upon my ,account of- Coheſion: produced by Electricity. I had. not made any great progreſs, in the Aſeries of Experiments and Obſervations' I hãve already had the honour to communicate, before I perceived that the: black and white Stockings, when electrified, and allowed to come together, not only joined extremely cloſe, but actually ſtuck to each other; inſomuch that unleſs when weak in Electricity, or improperly applied, I eould make the White bear the weight of the Black, or the black that of the white, and that for a conſiderable time. But as the Weather, for ſome Monihs in Winter, was ſo ſeldom favourãble for electrical Experiments, that Ithad ſcarcely opportunities ſufficient to ſatisfy myſelf with regard to other p0ints, I did not enter upon an examination of this Phenomenon experimentally, itill about the latter end of March. By that time I had got ready the ſcale of a balance properly fitted with a hook to catch hold of the Stocking, à ſet of Troy-weights I could depend upon, anũ an exact pair of Scales, to take the preeiſe weight of the Stockings as occaſion ſhould require. By experience I found that the ſame pair of Stockings did not always do equally well, even independently of the Weather; and, that by being too frequently electrified at a time, their virtue appeared to diminiſh. I therefore judged it proper to be provided with changes of pairs; and that there might be the greater conformity lli between &r c2m—-——æg -  ii nœæm--——-——" ————4 airm 4tuh between the Experiments, I choſe therm ãà⸗ oxactly as poſſible of the ſame ſize and ſubſtance. The ſort I fixed upon is what is called half Gauze, the weight of the white Stocking, at an average; 18 penny-weights and 10 grains; but when dyed black 1 ounce and I pentiyweight, the weight being'increaſed by the dying of that Colour, above 5 penny-weights in the pair. When the white and the black ſtockings were warmed at the Fire, ſo as to be prepared for Electricity, they uſually loſt about ã twentieth part of their weight; ſo that in the courſe of my Experiments, I rate the white at 17 penny- weights and an half, and the black at I ounce. The Scale, with the ſilk lines that belonged to it, and the hook was adjuſted preciſely to the weight of 1 òunce; and as I commonly meaſured the ſtrength of Coheſion by fixing the hook to the black Stocking, and taking hold of the white, I had but to make an allowance of two ounces more than the weights put into the Scale, ſo as to take the preciſe weight the Stockings could raiſe by the Power of Coheſion. llll I meaſured this Power two different wãys; the firſt, while the one Stocking was ſtill within the other; ſecondly, when ſeparated, and the one afterwards applied externally to the other. In the firſt of theſe caſes, it may be thought that an allowance ſhould be made for the friction in pulling the Stockings aſunder; but that appeared to me to be very inconſiderable, for wher when thoſe of the ſame colour were put one within the other and inverted, they dropped aſunder of themſelves; or if there was any entanglement about the heel, a little ſhaking diſengaged and ſeparated them: However, if it ſhould be thought proper, the allowance of an ounce may be made, by deducting ſo much from the weight reſpectively found. I have but one Circumſtance more to mention before I proceed to give the reſult of my Experiments; which is, that we muſt not be ſurpriſed when we find the force of Coheſion externally to be in no more regular proportion than that within; for when the Stockings are highly electrified, they ruſh with ſuch impetuoſity, that it is extremely difficult to direct their motion, and make them meet in the manner moſt advantageous for Coheſion. In the Experiments I have made to meaſure the force of electrical Coheſion, I have always found it anſwerable, ſo far as I could judge from appearances, to the degree of Electricity at the time excitedl. When the Stockings have been but weakly electrified, I have found them unable to ſupport the weight, the one of the other. When in a more powerful ſtate of Electricity, Ihave known them to raiſe, reſpectively, from one to twelve ounces, and upwards; nay, once I found the Coheſion ſo ſtrong as to move ſeventeen ounces, including the Scale and the black Stocking. For the ſake of accuracy, I ſhall give a particular account of the reſult of a few —n—————ut . few of my moſt remarkable Experiments, as I find them in the Notes, which I took at the time of making them. The firſt I find is of the 30th of March, the Wind at north-eaſt, the Weather clear, inelining to froſt. The white Stocking within the black raiſed the weight of one pound one ounce ſix penny-weights and an half, half a penny-weight more ſeparated them. I find no note here taken of the weight born by the Stockings applied externally to each other. April 6th, a hazy and wet morning; but the wind at north-eaſtt. With new Stockings the white being within the black, raiſed eleven ounces without, ſix ounces. With another pair that had been much uſed in Experiments, the white within raiſed ſix ounces without three ounces. April 16th, ãa clear dry morning, the wind at north-eaſt, Fahrenheit's Thermometer at 48. Of the new, the white Stocking within raiſed one pound five ounces without, ſix ounces fifteen penny-weights. Of the old, the white Stocking within raiſed eight ounces without five bunces fifteen penny- weights. The force with which the black and the white Stockings cohere is not the only thing remarkable in their junction. The ſolution of that Coheſion, and the different degrees of tenacity according to different circumſtances aſford ſome curious Obſervations. Vhen the black and the white Stockings are d 2 in in Coheſion with each other, if another pair, more highly electrified, be ſeparated, and preſented to the former, ſtill in conjunction, the black to the white and the white to the black, in that caſe the Coheſion of the firſt pair will be diſſolved, and each Stocking of the ſecond will carry off that of its oppoſite colour adhering to it. If the degree of Electricity of both pairs be equal, the Coheſion of the firſt pair will be weakened, but not diſſolved, and all the four will cohere, forming, as it were, one maſs. If the ſecond pair be but weakly electrified, the Coheſion of the firſt pair with one another will be but little impaired, and that of the Stockings of the ſecond with thoſe of the firſt will be weak in proportion. And laſtly, if the ſecond pair be not at all electrified, or if, in their place, any other body not electrified be preſented, there will be no effect roduced on either hand. Whhite Silk and black, when electriſed, not only cohere with each other in the manner ſnewn above, but in a high degree of Electricity, arę found both one and the other, to adhere to bodies of broad and even, or poliſhed ſurfaces, though thoſe bodies be not electrified. This adheſion I diſcovered accidentally. While Iwas about ſome electrical experiments, having, without deſign, thrown a ſtocking that was highly electrified haſtily out of my hand, I was ſurpriſed to find it, ſome time aſter, ſticking againſt the paper hangings of my room. This led Led mę to make the following experiments.  preſented the white and the black Silk, highly electrificd and in coheſion with each other, to the hangings; but no effect was produced. I then ſeparated the black from the white, and preſented them ſingly; in that caſe each of them readily adhered to the hangings, which they did when flung from a little diſtance, and continued there for near an hour before they dropped. Having ſtuck up the black and the white, in the manner above- mentioned, I came with another pair of Stockings highly electrified, and applying the white to the black, and the black to the white, I carried them off from the wall, hanging on thoſe that had been applied to them. When the ſecond pair were electrified, but to a moderate degree, on applying them in the manner above deſcribed, the former immediately quitted their hold of the hangings, and dropped to the ground. The ſame Experiments held with painted boards of the room, and likewiſe with the looking-glaſs; to the laſt of which both the black and the white Silk appeared to adhere more tenaciouſly, than to gither of the former. lil Having been told by one of my friends, that they had tried ſome of my Experiments mentioned in the preceding papers, but could not get them to ſucceed: I beg leave to add a few words before I conclude, by way of Caution to any, who may have a curioſity to verify my Experiments. However  However eaſy it may ſeem to be to follow the directions I have already given in electrifying the Stocking, I am ſenſible from my own experience, that an attention to a number of little circumſtances, beſides ſome ſmall degree of addreſs, is requiſite, in order to make it ſuceeed readily. This is known to have been the caſe with the electrical Tube and Globe: Few people, at firſt, knew how to manage them ſucceſsfully; and yet Glaſs is not ſo much expoſed to many inconveniencies, that affect Electricity, as Silk. To give but one inſtance of this: We know that a very ſmall quantity of duſt, or greaſe, or any other matter that ſticks to the Tube, will injure its Electricity: Now this is what may eaſily be wiped off from Glaſs; but it may be very difficult to clear the Silk of.it, as Silk is of a nature more apt to imbibe, and retain extraneous matter than Glaſs.From theſe conſiderations I ſhould not be ſurpriſed at any perſon's being diſappointed, as to the ſucceſs of their Experiments, in a few trials; but I ſhould think it not fair for them to conclude from thence, that thoſe above recited are not to be depended upon ſà).

Happen'd to be at Mr. Symmers on SaI turday the I5th inſtant, when he deſired me to be a witneſs to ſome electrical Experiments he was about to make with ſilk Stockings of a particular kind, which he had received for that purpoſe. The weather was then remarkably favourable for Electricity, being clear and dry, with a ſharp froſt, which had continued five or ſix  ——  ————————— laſtly, That they be dried before the fire, and warmed to about the degree of heat of the human body, before they be drawn upon the hand or leg. And when taken off, care ſould be had in ſeparating them, ſo as to keep them at à diſtance from ones cloaths, or any thing that may leſſen their virtue. The circumſtances above-mentioned, might be gathered from what has been ſaid in theſe papers; but I thought it not amiſi to bring them together in this note, days. days. The wind was eaſterly, and had beer in that quarter for ten days. It was about noon when we made our Experiments; the Barometer at 30, and Fahrenheit's Thermometer at 32. Fhe Stockings abovementioned were woven of carded and ſpun Silk, and were more ſubſtantial and weighty, than thoſe with which he had made the Experiments mentioned in his third Paper. One pair was of a deep black, having been twice dyed in order to improve the colour. Another pair was of the natural colour of the Silk of a duſky white, and both new. The pair of black weighed four ounces eight penny-weights and four grains; and the white three ounces eighteen penny-weights and fifteen grains. We began with making a few Experiments with the thin Stockings formerly made uſe of, and found the reſult to be much the ſame with what ĩs related by Mr. Symmer in his third Paper; that is, we found, that when the white Stocking was put within the black, or vice verſd, and both highly electrified, taking hold of the one, while a Scale with weights was put to the other, we could raiſe ſeventeen ounces before the Stockings ſeparated. We then repeated one or two of theſe Experiments with ſome little variation of circumſtances. We turned one of the Stockings inſide out, and put that within the other: The inner a r————mii  i—— = —————  /"-—mm ⸗ intier or. rough ſides of the Stockings heing thu⸗ together, by which means they took faſter hold of each other, we now found, that it required the weight of twenty ounces to ſeparate them. When the Stockings were ſeparated, and applied externally to each other, they then raiſed the weight of ten ounces. ] We next proceeded to try the electrical forc⸗ of Coheſion with the Stockings of a more ſubſtantial make, viz. thoſe I have above deſcribed; and there we found it to be much more conſiderable, as appears by the following Experimentss. I. When the white Stocking was put withiu the black (without either of them being turned infide out), ſo that the outſide of the white was contiguous to the inſide of the black, they lifted nine pounds; wanting a few pennyweights. Now, taking the weight of the Stocking to be one ounce, eighteen pennyweights, and fifteen grains ſviæ. the half of the weight of the pair as mentioned above), it follows, that by the foree of its Coheſion with the black, it raiſed fifty-five times its own weight. 2. When the white was turned inſide out; and put within the black, their inner or rough fides being contiguous, they lifted no leſo than fifteen pounds, one penny-weight and an half, before they ſeparated: So that, in this caſe, the ſingle Stocking raiſed ninety-two times its own weight. E e 3. When 3. When the inner Stocking was drawn out, and applied to the outſide of the other, they lifted one pound and three quarters; that is, between ten and eleven times the weight of the white Stocking. It is not my deſign to draw any concluſions rom theſe Experiments, and much leſs to determine how far electrical Coheſion may ſerve, as a principle, to account for many remarkable appearances in nature. I relate the Experiments I have been witneſs to by way of ſupplement to Mr. Symmer's third Paper; and I conſider the reſult of them, only, as a farther proof of the ſurpriſing degree to which a power in Electricity, which had not, before been attended to, may be carried, in even the ſlighteſt ſubſtances, thoſe of white and of black Silk. JOHN MITCHELL? In In farther Confirmation of the powerful Agency of the Electrical Fluid, if any farther Proof can be required, I will add a Letter from another very ingenious Author, tending to prove not only the Univerſality of the Electrical Fluid, but the ſame Electricity of the Human Body, and that of the Cloaths we vear:And as a variety of paſſages of the former are analogous to many contained in the latter, I ſhall inſert them in this Place. Theſe EXPERIMENTS are entitled, Singular ErrECTS Of ELECTRICITY, By P. BRIDONE, F. R. S. Which he introduces with Remarks on Vegetation, as follows. c F all the reaſons aſſigned for the wonderful Vegetation that is performed in different parts of the world, there is in fact none that contributes ſo much towards it, as a conſtant Electrical State of the Air. From a variety of Experiments it has been found, that an increaſe of the Electrical Matter increaſes the progreſs of all Vegetation. It probably acts there in the ſame manner as on the Animal Body;the Circulation we know is performed quicker; and the juices are driven through the ſmall veſſels with more eaſe and celerity. This has often been proved from the immediate Ee 2 removal removal of Obſtructions by Electricity; and probably the rubbing with dry and warm flannel, eſteemed ſo effitacious in theſe caſes, ĩs doing nothing more than exciting a greater degree of Electricity in the part; but it has likewiſe been demonſtrãted, by the common Experiment of making water drop through a ſmall capillary Syphon, which the moment it is electrified runs in a full ſtream.1I have, indeed, very little doubt, that the fertility of our Seaſons depends as much on this quality in the Air, as either on its heat or moiſture. Electricity will probably ſoon be conſidered as the great vivifying Principle of Nature, by which ſhe carries on moſt of her Operations. It is a fifth Element, perfectly diſtinct, and of a fuperior nature to the other four, which only compoſe the corporeal parts of matter: But this ſubtile and active fluid is a kind of Soul that pervades and quickens every particle of it. When an equal quantity of this is diffuſed thro' the Air, and over the face of the Earth, every thing continues calm and quiet; but if, by any accident, one part of matter has acquired a greater quantity than another, the moſt dreadful conſequences often enſue before the equilibrium can be reſtored. Nature feems to fall into convulſions, and many of her works are deſtroyed. All the great Phenomena are produced; Thunder, Lightning, Earthquakes, and Whirlwinds: For, I believe, there is little doubt, that all theſæ often depend on lil this   this ſole cauſe. And again, if we look down from the ſublime of Nature to its minutiæ, we ſhall ſtill find the ſame Power acting, though perhaps in leſs legible Characters; for as the knowledge of its operations is as yet in its infancy, they are generally miſunderſtood, or aſcribed to ſome other cauſe. However, Ihave no doubt, that in proceſs of time theſe will be properly inveſtigated; when Mankind will wonder how much they have been in the dark. It will then poſſibly be found, that what we call ſenſibility of nerves, and many of thoſe diſeaſes that the Faculty have as yet only invented names for, are owing to the Body's being poſſeſſed of too large or too ſmall a quantity of the ſubtile and active Fluid; that very Fluid perhaps, which is the vehicle of all our Feelings; and which they have ſo long ſearched for in vain in the nerves: For I have ſometimes been led to think, that this Senſe was nothing elſe than a ſlighter kind of electric effect to which the nerves ſerve as Conductors; and that it is by the rapid Circulation of this penetrating and animating Fire that our ſenſations are performed. We all know, that in damp and hazy weather, and when it ſeems to be blunted and abſorbed by humidity; when its activity is loſt, and little or none of it can be collected, we ever find our ſpirits more languid, and our fenſibility leſs acute: When therefore the Air ſeems totally deprived of it, the whole Syſtem is unſtrung, and the nerves ſeem to loſe à both both their tenſion and elaſticity, till the north or weſt wind awakens the activity of this animating power, which ſoon reſtores the tone, and enlivens all nature, which ſeemed to droop and languiſh during its abſence. It is likewiſe well known, that there have been inſtances of the human Body becoming clectric without the mediation of any electric ſubſtance, and even emitting ſparks of fire with a diſagreeable ſenſation, and an extreme degree of nervous ſenſibility. About ſeven or eight years ago, a Lady in Switzerland was affected in this manner, but I was not able to learn all the particulars of her caſe: however, ſeveral Swiſs Gentlemen have confirmed to mè the truth of the ſtory. She was uncommonly ſuſceptible of every change of weather, and had her electrical feelings ſtrongeſt in a clear day, or during the paſſage of thunder clouds, when the Air is known to be replete with that fluid. Her diſeaſe, like all others which the Doctors can make nothing of, was decided to be a nervous one; for the real ſignification of theſe words I take to be only, that the Phyſician does not underſtand what iĩt iĩs. Two Gentlemen of Geneva had a ſhort Fxperience of the ſame ſort of complaint, though ſtill in a much ſuperior degree. Profeſſor Sauſſure, and young Mr. Yalabert, when travelling over one of the high Alps, were caught amongſt thunder clouds; and to their utter ſ aſtoniſh-  aſtoniſhment, found their Bodies ſo full of electrical Fire, that ſpontaneous flatlhes darted from their Fingers with a crackling noiſe, and the ſame kind of ſenſation, as when ſtrongly electrified by Art. This was communicated by Mr. Valabert to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, I think, in the Year 1763; and you will find it recorded in their Memoirs. It ſeems pretty evident, I think, that theſe feelings were owing to the Bodies being poſſeſſed of too great a ſhare of electric Fire. This is a very uncommon caſe; but I do not think it at all improbable, that many of our invalids, particularly the hypochondriac People, and thoſe we call Malades Imaginares, owe their diſagreeable feelings to the oppoſite cauſe, or the Bodies bęing poſſeſſed of too ſmall a quantity of this Fire, for we find that a diminution of it in the Air ſeldom fails to increaſe theſe feelings, and vice verſẽ. Perhaps it might be of ſervice to theſe People to wear ſome electric ſubſtance next their Skin, to defend the Nerves and Fibres from damp, or non-electric Arr. I would propoſe a Waiſtcoat of the fineſt Flannel, which ſhould be kept perfectly clean and dry; for the effluvia of the Body, in caſe of any Violent perſpiration will ſoon deſtroy the electric quality: This ſhould be immediately covered by another of the ſame ſize of Silk, but without being ſewed together. The Animal heat, and the friction that exerciſe muſt occaſion betwixt theſe   theſe two ſuhſtances, Arodues powerful Electricity; and would form a Kind of electric Atmoſphere around the Body, that might poſſibly be one of the beſt prefervatives agqãinſt the Effects of damps:.4V As for our Swiſs Lady, I have little doubt that her complaints were owing in great part, perhaps entirely, to her dreſs; and that a very ſmall alteration, almoſt in part of it, would effectually have cured her. A Eady who has her Head ſurrounded with a Wire- cap, and her Hair ſtuck full of metal Pins, and who at the ſame time ſtands upon. dry Silk, is to all intents and purpoſes an electrical Conductor inſulated, and prepared for eollecting the Fire from the Atmoſphere: And it is not at all ſurpriſing, that during thunder ſtorms, or when the Air is extremely replete with electrical matter, ſie ſhould emit ſparks, and exhibit other appearances of Electricity. I imagine a very trifling change of dreſs, which from the eonſtant verſatility of their modes may ſome day take place, would render this Lady's difeaſe altogether epidemical amongſt the Sex. Only let the ſoles of their Shoes be made of an electric ſubſtance, and let the Wires of their Caps, and Pins of their hair be ſomewhat lengthened and. pointed outwards; and I think there ĩs little doubt that they wilt often find themſelves in an electrical ſtate: But indeed, if they only wear ſilk, or even worſted Stockings; it may ſometimes prove ſufficient; for . have often oſten inſulated Electrometers as perfectly by placing them on a piece of dry Silk or Flannel, as on Glaſs. EE How little do our Ladies imagine, when they ſurround their heads with Wire, the moſt powerful of all Conductors; and at the ſame time wear Stockings, Shoes and Gowns of Silk;, one of the moſt powerful repellents; that they prepare their Bodies in the ſame manner, and according to the ſame Principles as Electricians prepare their Conductors for attracting the Fire of LightningI If they cannot be brought to relinquiſh their wire Caps and their Pins, might they not fall upon ſome ſuch preſervative as thoſe which of late years have been applied to Objects of much leſs conſequence? Suppoſe that every Lady ſhould provide herſelf with a ſmall chain or wire, to be hooked on at pleaſure during thunder ſtorms. This ſhould paſs from her Cap over the thickeſt part of her hair, which will prevent the fire from being communicated to her head, and ſo down to the ground. It is plain that this will act in the ſame manner as the Conductors on the top of Steeples, which from the metal Spires that are commonly placed there, analogous to the pins and wires, were ſo liable to accidents. You may laugh at all this, but I aſſure you I never was more ſerious in my lifee. A very amiable Lady of my acquaintance, Mrs. Douglas of Kelſo, had almoſt Ioſt her Life by one of thoſe Caps mounted  mbs. She was ſtandF . mg  ing at an open Window duringa thunder ſtorm: The Lightming was attfacted by the wire, and the Cap was burnt to aſhes ; hagpily her hair was in its natural ſtate, without poWw der, gomatum, or pins, and prevented the fire from being eonducted to her head'; for as ſhie felt no kind of ſhock, it is probable that it went off ſrom the wires of the Cap to the wall, cloſe to which ſhe then ſtood. If it had found any Conductor to carry it to her Head or Body, in all probubility fle muſt have been killed A good ſtrong head of hair, if it is kept perfectly clean and dry, is probably one of the beſt preſervatives againſt the fire of lightning.

We have it ever in our power tobe powes A Experiments on the Electricity of Hair, which tend ſtil corvimce him yet morè of the truth of what he has advaneed. A Lady had told him, that on combing her Hair in froſty weather, in the dark, ſie had ſometimes. obſerved ſpatks fire to iſfue from it. This made him think of attempting lo colle® ilie electrical fire ffom Hair alone, without the aſſiſtancę of any electrical Apparatus. To this end, he deſired æ young Lady to ſtand on a cake of bees-wax, and t0comb ſær Siſter's Hai?r, who was ſitting on a Chair before her. — Soon aſter ſhe began to comb, the young Lady on the uœ; was greatly aſtoniſhed to find her whole Body elættrifiuò: darting out ſparks of fire againſt every object that approachèd her. The Hair was extremely electrical, and aũœã an Electrometer at a very great diſtance: He charged a metal Conductor from it with great eaſe; and in the fpace oſ æ few minutes collected as much fire immediately from the Hair, as to kindle common ſpirits; and by means of a ſmall phiãl, ę2ve many ſmart ſiocks toãll the Company.

And although we are told hy the wiſeſt Man,  that he who increaſeth Knovledãe increãàth Sorrow; yet we are not to infer fromthence that Science is an object unworthy ofi our purſuit, but only. that our higheſt intellectual Acquirements in this World are partial gud unſatisfying; and that after ourſ moſt aſſiduous Application we ſhall find, to our sSorrow, that although we may have learned much, yet many more things ſtill remain, uhich cannot be fathomd by the ſhort line of human Underſtanding. However, it muſt be allowd, that Knowledge is productive of a proportionable degree of Pleaſure, and an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of it would be the neareſt approach to perfect Happineſs.ſ ũi H E RE is ſcarce any thing; iſays the ingenious Author of the Free 3i Enquirer,, more agreeable, than to conſider the gradual riſe and improvement of the human Species. At firſt they are Infants, weak and helpleſs, with no appearance of any rational or moral Powers; and were a perfect Stranger to the Race, and to our World, to obſerve them then, it wonld appear very unlikely to him, if not impoſible, they ſhould comẽ to be the Creatures they afterwards are. From Babes they riſe to Childhood; from Childhood to Youth, and all the while their Facul- Faculties inſenſibly open, the Põœẽrsunſfold chemſees; thẽ”́ ſarn Hubit and Experience, 11ll at length they arę ſitted for, and arrive at Manhood, where their intęll6ctual and moral Capacities ſnew themſelves in ĩheir full ſtrength, and ſcope and õpportunities are given for the xerciſe and improvement of them. After this, when by means of the probation and diſcipline of Life, their Characters are formed to Virtue; and when the moral Principle is raiſed to its due ſtate of influence, and the requiſite temper and preparations for a higher ſtate of Being and Bliſs are acquired; they are taken from hence; they drop their preſent frailties and imperfections; they exchange Earth for, Heaven, and riſe from the Rank of Men to that of Angels. 1It is very natural to reflect here on the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, in cauſing our Exiſtence to be thus progreſſive; in making one ſtage of our Being a preparation for another; and not introducing us into any larger Spheres of Action and Enjoyment, before we are in a proper manner qualified for them. But what I have chieſly in view at preſent is, to take notice, that our progreſs will by no means end with this Life; that our next advance will not be our laſt and final one; but that, moſt probably, we ſhall always be in a Progreſs of Being, and for ever advancing. It Aeems quite unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that good Men willhereafter get to a point; beyond which they cannot go; or that a period can æn ever a.ar5v1a hvr vn”Y 557 nꝶ ę5 4  ] Lav; thtil Wiſes and Powers; and, the divin Na⸗ ture and Perfections, are houndleſs and inœæ⸗ hatiſtible. There appears, then, nothing t ſiʒ our progreſi We have infinite rom to expatiate in, apd ſcope for ęternal advances. Suppoſe, therefore, what is now pleaded for, to be fact; and it will be evident, that it is ſaying nothing, to affirm that a time muſt come, when there will be æ greater difference between what we ſhall be then, and what wæ are now, than between the firſt Arehangel, and the meaneſt Reptile; when, to take in, and ſurvey this whole Globe, or even Syſtem, will perhaps be no more to us, than it is now to obſerve what paſſes in the ſame Room with us. There would appear nothing incredible in this, if Perſons would but conſider, that by going on to improve, let it be ever ſo ſlowly, through infinite Ages, we muſt make more, and higher Acquiſitions, and come to greater degreœes of Knowledge, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Power, and Perfection, than any which it is now poſſũĩble for us to aſſign or imagine; that this Earth, nay probably this whole viſible frame of Sun and Stars, compared with the immenũty of the Creation, is but a point, and that nothing finite bears any proportion to what is infinite. From thus viewing things forwards, and conſidering, the future progreſs oſ reaſomblæe Bemgs, I cannot help taling occaſion to turn my Fhoughts backwards, and obſerving that there, muſt undoubtedly exiſt Beings who were I the - zZutV——ttei rre  srin s s i uEn ( 226) the firſt Productions of the Divine Power; that the time which has intervened ſince theſe received their Exiſtence (though it ſhould- be allowed impoſſible to be properly Infinite) yet is in all probability Indefinite; that through this whole immeaſurable length of duration, they have been growing and improving, and conſequently muſt ere now be arrived at degrees of Intelligence, Dignity, and Excellence, that are above all human Conception. For my part, I am well convinced, that even after our utmoſt endeavours to the contrary, we are apt to entertain much too low Ideas of the Syſtem of the Creation, and the poſſible, nay actual, Dignity and Grandeur of intellectual Beings. It muſt not, be forgot, however, that how highly ſoever we conceive of reaſonable Creatures, and whatever degrees of Superiority and Perfection we believe they may poſſeſs; yet they are, and (after the farther Improvement of numberleũ Ages) muſt ever continue, all equally dependent upon, and inferior to the Creator; all (ſtrictly ſpeaking) equally nothing, compared vith him, and at the ſame, that is an infinite, diſtance from original, neceſſary abſolute Perfection. But to return to the Contemplation of our own Natures and Hopes; upon any notion of the future ſtate, it muſt be true, that we are now as incapable of forming any Idea of what we are to be, in it, as a Child in the ment, and Happineſs, of a grown Man. But take in the Conſideration that we are to be always improving, and it will appear, that, in no aſſignable future period of our Exiſtence, we ſhall be able to conceive what we are further to be, in the periods beyond that. Here I find it almoſt impoſſible to reſtrain myſelf. To be eternally aſcending in the Scale of Being How high then ſhall we at laſt reach And, though always happy to the utmoſt extent of our Wiſhes, yet not to be able to imagine, in any part of our future Being, how much more happy, great, and good, we are to be What a Proſpect is this How vaſt How aſtoniſhing! Theſe obſervations naturally give occaſion to enquire, 1ſt, Whether it is credible, that Beings, who can thus extend their Views and Hopes through Eternity, and are capable of ſuch a Progreſs, ſhould be deſigned for a low, momentary Exiſtence here; ſhould all periſh in the firſt ſtep of their Progreſs; and after juſt ſhewing themſelves to the World, and being curſt with the Idea and Wiſh of Immortality, ſink into Oblivion and Annihilationn In the next place, how can we ſufficiently adore the Goodneſs of God, in bringing us into Being; in placing us in ſuch a Rank amongit his Creatures, and ſetting before us ſuch a Proſpect? Further; how unſpeakable does the Dignity of human Nature appear when thus conſidered? G3 What  ( 228) What reaſon have Mankind to reverence tHemſelves? And how proper and important Objects are they of that extraordinary Interpoſition and Apparatus to ſave them, which Chriſtianity reveals? Every Particle of Matter in the Univerſe is continually acted upon by the Deity; but one human Mind, with ſuch Capacities as have been repreſented, is infinitely ſuperior in value to the whole material Univerſe; and the ruin of it, of infinitely greater Conſequence. Again; ; how dreadful a thing is Vice, which ruins ſuch noble Beings, indiſpoſes them for the Happineſs of their Natures, and bereaves them of all their high and infinite Hopes? It is undoubted, that Virtue and. Righteouſneſs are, and muſt be, the only Qualifications for Bliſę, under the Government of a Righteous Being. I am ſure no wiſe Perſon will ſlight this' Ohſervation. For though the probability were ſuppoſed greatly againſt its being true; thouQ the preſumption were ever ſo ſmall for th reality of ſuch a State of ever growing Bliſs a I have deſcribed, which Vice in any de endangers the Loſs of; it would ſtill, aeun ſtrably, be the extreme of Madneſs not to reſign all for the ſake of it, and not with the greateſt Anxiety to avoid what may, any way, tend- 10 diminiſh our Chance for it. Finally; ſuch Reflections as thoſe above made, ſhould, ſurely, raiſe us above this World, and leſfen our Attachment to it. How ſad ĩs it to ſee the Heirs of ſuch Hopes wallowing in the the Mire, and revelling with Brutes How unnutural for Minds which the whole World cannot buy, that can take in the Univerſe, and were hom for Eternity, to contract their Wiſhes and Regards to a point, and an inſtant WVWe are to outlive the Sun and the Moon. What an Elevation and Dignity ſhould the View of this give to our Behaviour? How ſhould the unbounded Proſpect looſen us from the Earth, and give Wings to our Minds How ſhould we trample on the Tinſel of Life, and anxiouſly avoid every thing unbecoming our vaſt Expectations] What can we think of thoſe groveling Souls who forget their higher Countty; who diſgrace their heavenly Original; who can contentedly look forward to Annihilation;; whoſe Ambition riſes no higher than the proſent State; and who abandon the common anã rational Hope of Mankind concerning a future Immortality? Theſe renounce the noble Principles and Aims of all that are worthy to be reckoned Men, and ſhould indeed be looked upon as betrayers of their Intereſts, as Traitors to the Species; as Fugitives from the Rank and Station, the Dignity and Privileges of reaſonable Beings; and ought to be treated with ſuitable Scorn and Contempt. To conclude: Human Life conſidered in itſelf, and compared with our whole duration, and unlimited Capacities and Hopes, is indeed ſo little and low a Thing, that it ſcarcely deſerves the Name of Exiſtence; and. it is abſoG g 2 lutely  ( 232) he true, they humbly propoſe, that in order tol decide the grand point, a ſtrict ſcrutiny mæy he made into the merits of both, which being once: done, Philofophers will norlonger halt between two ſuch different and contradictory Opinions; but we ſhall then go hand in hand, and proceed in our phyſical Reſearches with Perſpicuity and Pleaſure. As ſuch a ſtrict examination can injure neither Party, tis preſumed no impartial Enquirers can reaſonably reject the Propoſal; and the motive which can prevent ſuch a ſtrict examination muſt ſavour ſtrongly of invincible prejudiecee-Unnleſs ſuch a deciſive method be purſued, and electrical Philoſophy be throughly examinod, as propoſed, the current Philoſophy muſt neceſſarily remain where Sir Iſæac Newton left it, which, as he informs us in the Preface to his Principia, was then in an intricate ſtate, and that Philoſophers attempted the ſearch of Nature in vain ſa); intimating alſo at the ſame time, that the receivd Philoſophy was nor a true one. And they ſeem not yet much more inclined to attempt the ſearch of Nature upon any other plan than that which they have ſo lIong and ſo unſucceſęfully purſued; and not any beſides a: few electrical Philoſophers attempt to explain it, at the preſent, on any other   (a) Electri oal Philoſophers: are certain that it was out of the power of Philoſophers to attempt the ſcarch of Nature vith Succeſs, beſore a more elaſtic ſubtile Medium vas diſcovered to-them tlian that of the common Air. ti Prin- Principle, notwithſtanding the length of time the electrical ſubtile Medium has been diſco+ ver'd, and our intimate familiarity with it by eans of the numberleſs Experiments which have been made upon it; ſand yet we ſeem almoſt as much unacquainted with it as ever; for go into what Company we will, if Electricity happens to be the Topic of Converſation; nothing is more common than to hear Men expreſſing the greateſt Admiration concerning it, aſking us, What can it be Whence does it proceed, and how do you account for that ſurpriſing Power and Force which we behold in moſt of the Experiments? And what is very remarkable, not only common People thus interrogate, but the leamed and ſagacious.  Blectrical Philofophers ſolve thoſe formidable Difficulties by Principles previouſly proved; ive that the electrical Fluid is an univerſal Pire in the form of an extremely fine and pure elaſtie Air. That all Nature is neceſſarily replete with it, inſomuch that an abſolute Plenum of ĩt becomes the natural Conſequence That by means of its force and action, all the abſtruſc Phenomena exhibited in the Experiments are ſolvvde. They moreover produce undeniable Evidence to prove that this elaſtic Fire acts on all other Bodies with an impelling forceee DBut in order to render this method of Reaſoning yet more ſatisfactory, I muſt ſubjoin the ſix fundamental Articles contained in my Eſſays, p. 22, that the Readers of the preſent Work ũi may may have them ready at hand to conſult in their reſearches upon all occaſions. Firſt. That in the beginning, the Ar LVWisz and OMNIPOTENT CREATOR of 4li Things formed an univerſal æthereal FluũW or primary Air, endued with the utmoſt purity, ſubtilty, and rarity; and in fine, a perfectly ſubtile elaſtic Fluid. LSecondly. That the whole Univerſe is replete with it; for otherwiſe a Fluid ſo perfectly ſubtile and elaſtic would be perpetually expanding, till all parts were equally full; and then neither the whole, nor its parts, could remain endued with that perfect elaſticity, which was at firſt ſuppoſed, and at preſent appears to be. Thirdly. That this Ether or pure Air is univerſal, not only in all open ſpaces, but in the minuteſt vacuities of the moſt compact Bodies, by reaſon of its being compoſed of almoſt infinitely finer Particles than thoſe of groſ Matter, which renders it capable of permeating the ſmalleſt Pores and Interſtices of the hardeſt and cloſeſt Subſtances. VFourthly. Since the Earth is endued with a property of tranſpiration or of breathing forth the moſt volatile parts of it to a conſiderable height from its ſurface; thoſe Effluvia become blended, incorporated, and moſt intimately mixed with Particles of the univerſal pure Ether or primary Air, and by that means conſtitute a ſecondary Air ſa), or aẽrial Fluid, and the only one that could (till now) be proved to exiſt. (a) Atmoſphere F ifthly. Fiſibi. That from the elaſticity of ĩts Paræ ticles ariſeth an Intumeſcence, a ſwelling or expanding Property and conſtant endeavour of extending their Limits to greãter Dimenſions: Hence they, and conſequently all maſſes compoœd of ſuch elaſtic Particles mutually repel. Sixthly and Laſtly. That this univerſal Air, although inviſible, is nevertheleſs true and real Fire in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, ãand endued with the utmoſt Force. Theſe Articles were at firſt propoſed as a Theory only, and having for ſeven or eight years paſt been ſtrictly and repeatedly examined, without the leaſt degree of prejudice by the Author, who cannot find any reaſon to alter his Sentiments;tis therefore preſumed they are juſtly founded and may be ſafely carried into Practice. What I mean by Theory and Practice is, that having been verſed in a Theory for ſeven years, it muſt then be high time to attempt the Praxis: that is, aſter having purſued the analytical method a ſufficient length of time, we may fairly proceed to the ſynthetical; viæwe may then reaſon a priori. B. Our greateſt Naturaliſts ſeem unanimouſly to explode ?hat method of reaſoning in their phyſical reſearches. The grand Hypotheſis of Des Cartes being founded entirely on a priori, might poſſibly be one principal cauſe for rejecting the whole: But can you aſſign any other reaſon H h A.  A. Before the Diſcoveries that have been made by means of the electrical Apparatus, we had no other ſaſe way of advancing than by reaſoning a poſteriori; there was then no other method to inveſtigate the Cauſe: Whereas the means which are afforded us from Electricity having diſcover'd it, we may now ſafely proceed with preciſion and certainty in the other way, namely, from the Cauſe to the Effect. Your Obſervation on Des Cartes in particular ſeems indeed to be juſt; as his Syſtem was very exceptionable on that account, it being merely arbitrary, and without any proper foundation for its ſupport. B. What have the electrical Philoſophers that is remarkably ſubſtantial and unexceptionable whereon to found rbeir method of reaſoning a priori? i A. That which no Age before was ever in poſſeſſion of, viz. the firſt Mover among ſecondary Cauſes is now realized and become clearly Enown to us as a permanent Principle under the form of pure Fire. N. B. I have been the more explicit on this ſubject, in order to ſhew that there was no other than that backward way of proceeding in our phyſical reſearches with ſucceſs, before Fire, that firſt mechanical Agent was diſcoverd. A Glimpſe of this unknown ſomewhãt in Bodies was diſcoverd by means of the pneumatic Engine, and afterwards clearly confirm'd and and verified by the electrical Engine, and is the grand Agent which has ſo ama7æ'd Mankind, and which is found capable of ſolving all thoſe otherwiſe inexplicable Diffioulties. --; Every Spectator of the Exporiments plainly diſcover it to be true Fire; but the electrical Philoſophers by means of an indefatigable and ſtrict Examination of it for a ſeries of years paſt, have at length found it to be an univerſal Fire in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, not only in the pores of all groſs Bodies, but confequently in all free and open ſpaces. SEEP In a word, if the current Philoſophers can ſupport their doctrine of an univerſal Vacuum and an attracting Force in a more rational and ſatisfactory manner, electrical Philoſophers will not only publickly acknowledge their miſtake, but will think themſelves highly indebted for the means of their conviction. But on the other hand, if the doctrine of an electrical Plenum cannot be refuted and fairly ſet aſide, they appeal to all the judicious and impartial Enquirers after Truth, whether that be Dot a ſtrong preſumption in their favour, that their Scheme is well founded. lli 88MMæ nuꝶꝶææ nnxœæat H h 2 POST- POS TS CRIP T a r xc O U may probably recolle|t that : Y x I never made any Reply to the xæ1 Animadverſions of the Monthly  Reviewers on my printed Letter to them: My Reaſon for it was, that I never deſigned to have troubled myſelf, nor the Public with any more of their impertinent Cavils; but their Animadverſions on my Philoſophical Efſays were of too inſolent and flagitious a nature to be paſſed by unnoticed. B. I cannot ſay I remember it, and therefore pleaſe to proceed. A. At page 26th of that Letter, I inform d thoſe Writers, that as I had then gone through their Animadverſions in the manner I propoſed at the beginning of it, I ſhould take leave of thom at that time, and unleſs they would conſent to carry on the ſame kind of Correſpondence by the channel of their monthly Paper, I ſhould take a final leave, ſince it muſt be obvious to every one how impracticable a thing it was to write and publiſh a Pamphlet or æa Letter every time they might think proper to raiſc an objection ſ a). But if they ſhould re-  -iar- æ  _ t (a) Every Author is very nſible of the trouble nd diſiculty it muſt be, excluſive of the Expence of a Performance from the Preſs; and even aſter that he may juſtly deſpai r oſ any ſmall thing becoming very publie: Thoſe Writers bein ſonſible of theſęo things, and as I had informd them that I ply  the plan they had formed; or fòr wãnt of room, &c. poſſibly it might be thought an evaſion merely to ſhift off the forcę of the Argument; and therefore, if they had that ſincere regard for Science, which they frequently expreſſed, they could have no jut reaſon to reject the Propoſal of carrying on ſuch a Correſpondence in the manner above mentioned. BY thus continuing an amicable communication of Sentiments on the ſubject of Electricity, ſomething acceptable might be reaſonably expected. We may then, if neceſſary, reſume the ſame things. For although Iam entirely convinced as to the repulſive ſcheme, yet the word Attraction could not, as I then thought, be wholly diſuſed, particularly, when I conſiderd the accumulation on the glas Tube or Globe, or in the electrical Phial, as alſo, how light bodies are moved with ſuch rapidity to the body electrified, without ſuppoſing ſome kind of Attraction ſc). If thoſe, and the like ſhould, for ſuch-like Reaſons, take a final leave of them, the might well ſappoſe they could ſay whatever they pleaſed with impunity. Theſe are ſuch important Reaſons that will ever tevent them from carrying on any controverſy in their Revie, and they are accoringly found as if proceeding on ſuch mean Principles; and at the ſame time afſirming for Truth, the moſt notorious Falſhoods, as will evidently appear, when I come to their Animadverſions on my Philoſophical Eſſays. : ſ) Here it plainly appears, that my Obſervations at that time had not furniſhed me with Data ſuſficient to enable me to account for that force, which is now plainly deduciblę ſrom the doctrine of falling bodies, namely, an exterior and univerſal 1IMPELLING Force, Problems can be ſatisfactorily ſolvã, we may hope in time, hy means of ſuch a Correſpondence to arrive at ſo much perfection, as to attempt a true Theory, or regular Syſtem of that myſterious Science, and to ſee Electricity eſtabliſhed on as firm a foundation as any other Science can claim.

We little thought, ſay thoſe Reviewers, to have heard from Mr. Lovett  again on this ſubject, after what paſſed be-  teen us in a former Review; much leſs  that he ſhould complain of our Severity,  when he was himſelf, in ſo great a degree,  the Aggreſſor. A. What a barefac'd Falſhood do they begin with when they charge me with being the Aggreſſor? and the reaſon that they give for it'is as uncommon, viz. that there are Men as  well as Arguments that are unanſwerable; and it appears plainly to them, that I deſerve a place among the former.

Review.  But, ſuppoſing it conſiſtent with our plan, as ĩt is not; to what purpoſe ſhould we diſpute? If Mr. Lovett cannot comprehend us, we never can hope to convince him; and     That Water is a Conductor of the electric Force, but not of e the electric Matter; that by every Conductor of Electricity  in theſe Experiments, a motion only is propagated, but no real Fire conveyed, though ſparks of Fire can be diſcharg-  ed from any point of that Conductor; theſe are diſtinctions  100 reſned or the Comprehenſion of Electricians. You i cannot even ſuppoſe that a mind ſeriouſly inquiſitive aſter  Truth, can be ſatisfied with ſuch Cobuebs of Metaphyſics.  Surely, it is more Philoſophical, as well as more eaſy and  natural, vhen we ſee Fire copiouſly ſtreaming ſrom the  extremities oſ electrified Wires ranged near together, to  truſt our Senſes, and to admit this as ocular Demonſtration “ oſ the extreme ſubtilty of electric Fire and of its Power to  paſs through denſeſt Bodies: To talk of electric Force,  abſtractedly ſrom the elctric Matter is abſolutely unintelli“gible.” - as ãs to his ſftrong deſire of entering into a neãrer and cloſer engagement, that the Matter in debate may be brought to a fair Iſſue, and the Public no longer to remain in doubt which of us is in the right, we are willing to reſt our Cauſe with the judicious Reader on the merits of what has been already ſaidl. Indeed we conceive, that thoſe who have paid any attention to this little debate remain in no doubt about the matter: At leaſt, we ſhall think ſo till it is intimated to us from ſome other quarter: In which caſe, when called upon by a Perſon capable of comprehending us and receiving ſatisfaction on the ſubject in queſtion, we ſhall be ready to give it in as ample a manner as is conſiſtent with our Work, or can be reaſonably required by our Readers. e: Our Antagoniſt will doubtleſs eall this in his uſual ſtile, a jeſuitical way of ſhifting off the Argument; intolerable arrogance; &c. we muſt take the liberty to tell him, however, iĩt is not the Argument, but rhe Vriter we ſhould be pleasd to get rid of ſa): If we muſt engage in a Controverſy, we are indeed ſo far ambitious, as to wiſh it may be with a Writer capable of underſtanding, and replying io an Argument. (a) Had there been any Truth in that Aſſertion why did they ſeven Years aſter, unprovobd, attack me again ? / The Truth appeais plainly to be this, though they ſeem aſham'd to conſeſs it, that they were in reality weary of the Argument, and, conſcious that they were unequul to it, would fain ſhiſt it off to the Writer. Ii An-  Anfwer. May not this be properly ſtiſed huſfling and jeſuitical evaſion, and ſuch ſas Id obſerv'd candid Writers would be alhamd of. Five Years after, in the Year 1766, publiſhed my Philoſophical Eſſays; which Performance was taken notice of the ſame yeatr, by the candid Authors of the Critical Review; who gave it ſo great a Character, that my cavilling Hypercritic: had not the face to vent their ſpleen on it till full two years after; when they might very probably think the commen-datory Character given of it by the former was forgotten. I ſhall therefore next 'inform you, that after having viewd and reviewd the Con-tents of my Philoſophical Eſſays, i. e. having often perufed them with the greateſt Cate andCircumſpection which my ſlender Capacity would admit of, and conſcious that I. had adt vanced nothing but what appeared to be ſtrictly agreeable to Truth; yet, leſt I ſhould”havẽeſ been too much prejudiced in favour of my oꝶ”Sentiments, which was very probable as wellas natural, I made it my Buſineſs to conſultnot only my Friends with whom I converſed, but wrote to divers others to deſire they would favour me with what appearcũ to them to be not well founded, and would therefore be the moſt liable to objection: My Intention in this was, that I might endeavour to obviate ſuch Objections for the future; by, Firſt, ſtating them in their full force, and then replying to them Iheſe Thoughts naturally directed me to my VUdqlaæ old Antagoniſts, the celebrated Authors of the Monthly Review, where I had no doubt of being plentifully ſtock'd without àny more trouble, but found myſelf greatly miſtaken; for inſtead of rationAl Objections, and ſuch as might be ſatisfactorily replied to, they were found inſulting their poor Culprit in the moſt ſcandalous manner; and their Animadverſions ſuch as were quite incapable of any regular Anſwer, by being ſo ſtuffed with bombaſt, immoderate ſcoffing and rancour, pointed with the keeneſt ſarcaſms and ſcurrility on the one hand, and as ridiculouſly ludicrous on the other. In ſhort, nothing was omitted which they thought capable of rendering me contemptible; and they ſeemd at the ſame time ſo vain as to think their Readers would be highly pleaſed with ſuch low Witticiſms and. Froth ſã). But although their Animadverſions were unworthy and even incapable of a regular Anſwer, yet that you may be able to form a judgement : -  (a) Ihad a ſight view of their Animadverſions ſoon aſter they were publiſhi'd, where I found nothing but what I expected, viz. ſuch rant as above mentioned: As I had then no intention of publiſhing a Supplement to, my Eſays, I had thereſore no deſign of troubling myſel? with them any more; but when I began that, I was inclined to peruſe their Remarks again, and with ſome attention; but eſpecially when I found them to contain noò leſs than ten Pages and an half, it was no wonder if they excited my curioſity ſo far as to examine how it was poſſible to ſpin them out to ſuch a ręſpeciful extent, and what could induce ſuch eminent Writers to beſtow ſo much time and pains upon the trifling Labours oſ a Perſon whom they ſo frequently ſtile a moſt feeble Ontagoniſt.

We called r forth all our philological Powers, and even  ſummoned a Board of Criticiſm on the oc? caſion, which broke up re infectã after con-  ſulting every lexiphanic Book in Becker's ? Shop, from Hedericus and Johnſon, ęven rdown to the Scoundrels Dictionary. Moſt Wonderfull e We are candid enongh to own,  that though we at laſt maſterd it, ĩit was not till our Index-maker, who was in waite ing upon this occaſion, inſtinctively, as iĩt  were, ſpied it in the Gloſſary or Explãnation 1 of the moſt difficult Words, which Mr. t Lovett, we ſuſpect, from an old grudge, and s with a view of diſtreſſing us Critics, had r artfully concealed behind his Index; ſmrewãly gueſſed indeed ]  we forgive him, however, and even congratulate him on the i prodigious advances he has made in Litera(a) Wonderſul indeed, that that ſnould ever be ata fault s ture  EL . —ii  ——s ——— :i autã ;l f, ture, ſincę the publication of the ſecond part  of his ſubtile Medium proved: At that ſime 1 he durſt not uſe the term Electrician with-  out referring us in a notẽ to the Authority  of Dr. Franklin; we find him now ſetting  up for himſelf, and producing, if not comning a word that has puzzled a whole College of  Reviewers. We are prompted however,  perhaps, by a little ſpice of envy,” ſſrewdly gueſſed again] ⸗ to declare our opinion, that this word has too ill-favour'd an appearance, s and is too ſtrangely turnd, ever to be ads mitted, without a ſtruggle, into the Engliſh s Language? Query, Can this harangue come from Philoſophers? Can ſuch ſtuff he the Language of Critics? Have they not arrogantly uſurped the Title, and ſot themſelues up asJudges of the Labours of the Learned, and Cenſors in the Republic of Letters, before they werę properly qualified for it? Can learned and ſagacious Men, ſuch as Critics are expected to he, be ignorant of the meaning of ſuch a term as Tranſpeciation ? a term ſo expreſſive, and which carries its meaning along with ũĩts ſound, as all terms ought to do, and particularly technical ones? Could it be expected that a whole Body of Critics, or indeed any learned Men (not to ſay Body of Men) ſhould be ſo diſtreſſed as to ſummons their whole College to the Council Board, about the meaning of a common word; at leaſt I had no reaſon to think but but it was as common and proper as? moſ* other terms, particularly as I found it in à Dictionary which has long had the approbation of the Learned ſa) A1tu murſtitne amnm Tis plain however from their own accoũnt, that they were at no ſmall pains about findihẽ out the meaning of that word, and tell us they had not maſtered t at laſt, had it not been for theit Index-maker, who, as they inform us was in waiting on that grand occalion. This However is thought abundantly ſufficient to ſiew what trifling Writers they are, as well as implacable; implacable Iſay, ſince it was ſevenVears after they had heard from me, which wa in my printed Letter to them, publiſhed in the Year 1761. As I did not deſign to have an' thing more to ſay to them, I never ſo mch as once mentioned them in my Eſſays. lll Is it not ſtrange, that Critics who àvow themſelves to be Profeſſors of Science, and Adepts in Languages, ſhould be ſo miſerably at a loſs for the meaning of ſo ſignificant and intelligible a term?

Let them bloũ then, if they know how, at being thus diſtreſs'd by a word which has puzzled their whole College, i as they ſtile themſelves, and let me ſubjoin their merited addition, of B hds; for who but ſuch, would not have underſtood at firt ſight, a Term ſo caſy and expreſſive as Tranſpeciation? B. Thoſe Reviewers will ſurely be greatly irritated at your treating them with ſo litrle Ceremony. 4. What right they can claim to any favour from me, let the ſenſible and candid Reader judge, when he finds how rudely they have behaved towards me, though unprovokd. As a ſpecimen of their ſcurrilous treatment, let him obſerve the following extract. Mr. Lovett indeed does not ſeem to know where the Difficulties attending the ſubject really lie, though they are certainly obvious and numerous enough in all conſcience. We recommend it to him therefore to give Dr. Frantlins Letters a careful peruſal, and when he has maſterd them, to read Dr. Prieſtlys  familiar Introduction to the Study of Elecs tricity,    L L L - Ll N Diſcoverer of it is abſolutely falſeeAs for the ſubtite Medium of Sir Iſaac Newton, or the clementary Fire of the Antients, ſince in their time neither of them could be proved by Experiment, or thHat anjy ſuch thing exiſted, all therefore that they affirmed of it could be no more than hypotheſis or meer conjecture, it being only what they concluded from ſome of its remote effects. As therefore Electricity has diſcoverd, not only that ſuch a ſubtile Medium exiſts as they had foretold, but alſo that it is found to be poſſeſſed of all the ſurpriſing Properties that had been aſcribed to it, and that ſo plainly as to be realizd to the Senſes, was it not natural for me to think, fince this is ſo obvious, that all who were converſant with electrical Experiments ſhould be convinced of the ſimilarity or rather ſameneſò of them as well as myſelf? I may ſafely appeal to all candid Enquirers, whether it was at all probable that I ſhould ſuppoſe myſelf the only one who could diſcover ſo clear a Truth.All who lave read my accounts of it may find that theſe Writers havæe either not peruſed them with due attention, or elſe have deſignedly miſrepreſented them; ſincè I have been ſo far from endeavouring to perſuade the World that I was the only one who had made the firſt Diſcovery, that on the contrary I totally diſclaimed every pretence of that Eind, and think myſelf happy that Dr. Hoadly and Mr. Wilſon coincided with me in the fame Sentiments.

SS are true, which are otherwiſe toꝗ atrocious to bècredited; and which common humanity would forbid us to credit where Men are not remarkably abandond. What can be more wicked than thus ſtudiouſly to bear falſe witneſs againſt their Neighbour, as they have done in the preſent caſe? Common Fame chargeth them with receiving a bribe, in order to deal deceitfully with the Worla. Common Fame affirms that a certain Author wrote a Character of his own Book, and either brought or ſent it them, gilded with a piece of Gold, which ſo fat prẽvail'd, that the Authors own Character of his own work appeard in their Review in the front of their pretended Character. This account I heard of ſo long ago as our former diſpute, before my printed Letter to them in 1761 was publiſh'd, but could not help thinking it look'd too much like downright Calumny to be credited: Indeed I then really thought they could not be guilty of ſuch very dirty work; but my late experience of the malevolence of theĩr hearts makes me fear, at leaſt, that they were capable even of ſuch an ignominious action. DTo the many other Articles which conſtitute their true Character, that of Ingratitude might be juſtly added; of which the following is a remarkable inſtance.

Since they, far from ridiculing or contemning my feeble Pen, conferred a reſpectful tribute of their praiſe upon my Performance, and warmly recommended it as worthy the peruſal and attention of modern Philoſophers; and where they object to any thing that I have advanced, they do it with that Candour and Impartiality which will always mark a wide diſtinction between the fair ànd judicious Critic, and the illiberal and incompetent Caviller.

Such was alſo the Opinion of the  learned and ingenious Biſbop Berkeley; and  ſuch was the doctrine of many of the antient  Philoſophers. E Anſwer. What you affirm is moſt certain, but indeed I had never preſumed to differ in Opinion from the generality of Philoſophers, relating to a ſubject ſo abſtruſe and difficult as that of Fire was always allowd to be, had it not been for ſuch a remarkable and moſt reſplendent beam of light that was reflected on the ſubject by electrical Experiments. By means of which light, we are now ſo hap as to ſee realiæ?'d, what former Philoſophers only conjecturd, and who, conſequently could reaſon on it but very imperfectly. What they could judge of from ſome of its remote effects only, is completely demonſtrated to us by means of the plaineſt facts. ; Critical Review.  In a note on a paſſuge  which our Aurhor quotes from Biſinp Berkeley in proof of his oun Opinion, he ſays, almoſi  every breuth we reſpire informs us that there  is ſomething contained in Air, which is abſos ſutely   (282) lutely neceſſary to Life; this is uerified if the Bed-clothes are but arapped and confind cloſęly about the head;, ſo that no freſb Air may have room to paſi; for how ſoon atter are we ſenſible of à pain in the cheſt ? which increqàſes in proportion to the number of times tha Air has been breathed. li -2: s We allow the fact, but muſt reject it as a prooſ of his doctrine, for ſfrom the known conſtruction of the Lungs, admitting the Air to contain that elementary Fire neceſſary to Life, there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that it enters the Body through that organ rather than through the pores of the Skin. Beſides there is a much more rational method of accounting for this Phenomenon, by conſidering the Air as a menſtruum for vapors of various hinds. The ſume Air becomes uufit for frequent reſpiration becauſe it is ſoon ſaturated, and conſequently renderd incapable of abſorbing and carrying off thoſe noxious exhalations from the Lungs, wbhich being retaind and accumulated, provẽ the cauſe of ſuffocation Anſwer. Since the fact is allowd, what I ave advanc'd is no way refuted or ſet aſide; 1e fact itſelf being all I endeavourd to prove; e. that there appears ſomewhat in Air ſo bſolutely neceſſary to Life, that if we are eprived of it, we very ſoon expire. l Critical Review.  Paſſing over matters of leſs import we ſvall now proceed to Chap. s. Sect. 121, which contains the Authors Teen ſit 3  of — a A den oF iIhe Oſpce of. the Sun : Comparing the Macrocoſin, or great World, with the buman Body, the Microcoſim, or World in miniature, oand thence reſoning from analogy, he ſuppoſes the Sun to de the cor mundi or primum Mobile, which circulates th?o the ſolar Syſtem that Ather, Fire, or electrical Fluid which gives Life, Motion, &c. to this part of the UniverſeBut hy what means is this circulation perform⸗ ed ?2 This queſtion we ſball anſuer in the Authors own words. But in order to comprehend him perfectly, it will be neceſſary to quote a paſſage from Sir Iſauc Newtons Optics, inſerted by our Author, and upon which his Hypotheſis is founded. Every body, ſays Sir Iſanc, endeavours to go from the denſer port of the Medium towards the rarer, and if this Medium be rarer within the Sun's Body than aot his Surface, and rarer there than at the hundredib part of an Inch from its Body, and rarer there than at the fiftieth part of an Inch, and rarer there than at the Orb of Saturn, I ſee no reaſon why the increaſe of denſity ſbould ſtop any where, and not ratber be continued through all diſtunces from the Sun to Saturn and beyond. And though this increaſe denſity may, at great diſtances, be exceedingly , yet if the elaſtic force of this Medium be exceedingly great, it may ſuffice to impel bodies from the denſer parts of this Medium towards the rarer, vith all that power which we call Gravity. And that the claſi force of this Medium o c 75 is extremely great, may be gatherd fram the ſiſtneſs of its vibrations®.  Thus far, ſays our Author, Sir Iſaacs : Opinion seems to coincide exactly vith the pres ſent plan. Since then it ſeems reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the farther the ſolar Rays proceed  from him, the more denſe they are; conſequently when they have gone on so ſar as to meet with  thoſe from the neareſt Syſtems around them,  they muſt in thoſe far diſtant regions be denſeſt  of all. Is it not then natural to conclude, that  at ſo denſe a part of ſo extremely elaſtic æ  Medium, it muſt from thence return again to  the moſt rare part from whence it was sent,  and in its progreſi cauſe the centripetal farce  of the Planets, i. e. that force which caꝶſes  them to gravitate towards the Sun,  Doubtleſi there is ſome Ingenuity in this  Hypotheſis, but it does not by any means sollo ſrom Sir lſaac's aords above quoted. —  That great Philoſopher ſays no more thau thot  bodies flouting in  Medium of different denfity  uwill tend to the rareſt part of that Medium,  ĩt does not theręfore follow that the Meqium  itſelf muſt circulate” Anſwer. That the Medium itſelf muſt cir culate, cannot be reaſonably doubted, if e only conſider, that as the Sun's Rays arę every moment emitted ſfrom all the parts of his hody, ſo there muſt neceſſarily, to maintain an equilibrium, be as perpetual a ſupply, and cQnſequently that the Medium muſt thereſore ”eceſſarily circulate.

In my humble  npꝶion before it was affirmed that I ſeomd not ſufficiently acquainted with the properties fixed Air to reaſon on the ſubject, it ſhould firſt have been ſhewn herein my reaſoning on » tit as defective, But however, I muſt not omit rendering. my ; nct grateful acknowledgements to theſe judicious Critics, for treating the perſormanco in general, in the candid manner- they have done   done, but eſpecially for the Character they have given it at the Concluſion of their Remarks; as in the following wordss. æ It is well known that many attempts hauè been made towards reducing the variation of  the Needle to ſome certain rul]; but hitherto  without effect. The Author before us ſeems  10 have diſcoverd the laws by which this 4 Variation is influenced, and in conſequence  of that diſcovery is of opinion that the Lon: gitude at Sea may be found with great aceu-  racy. The principal difficulty ariſes from  the general imperfection of the Mariners  Compaſ- needles, which are commonly uſed. His Theory is founded on a ſuppoſition that  the magnetic Pole, to which the Needle  points, makes a regular Revolution round the  Pole of the Equator in a certain number of  Years. As to his mode of Caleulation; it  were impoſſible to make it perfectly intelli-  gible without tranſcribing the greateſt pattor  his Appendix, and therefore we muſt referſudhi  of our Readers as are curious in theſe mat-  ters to the Book itſelf, which is evidently a  Work of Genius, by no means undeſerving the  peruſal of modern Philoſophers. See the Oritical Review for October 17§66..4/ N. B. Since the Authors of the Monthly Review have thus endeavourd to impoſe on the Public in ſo groſs a manmer as they hũve done in the preſent caſe,tis my humble opinion they ought; in juſtice to it, if they reãlly 3 pretend - I; 7 n51ſ1 lil — - ESSE ——iu“" 5æ11ũE Gan- - pretend to knowany thing of Electricity; toæonſunt to whatĩ have formerly endeavour'd to bring them to, viZ. that in order to olear up the diſpute between us on ſo cu rious, ſo intereſtin and copious a ſubject as Electricity is allowd to be, that they would undertake to diſpute the point fairly, pro and con, by the channel of their monthly Paper, and then, whatever objection they might think proper to make, I would be ſure to reply to, and ſend it them time enough to be inſerted in their next. A correſpondence of this kind was ſolicited ĩn my public Letter to them, and treated by them with their uſual Air of Contempt. ill However, were they now to make a reply, the ſame excuſes which they.then made, would by no means ſerve their turn; that part of their dialect is grown too ſtale to paſs current at this Time: That which they advanced 11 Years ago, when Ifirſt ſent them the ſame invitation would by no means now ſerve the turn; Their reply to that invitation being remarkably arrogant, I ſhall here repeat it.  The defign of our Work they ſay, æ is miſtaken by ſuch as ſuppoſe it the Buſineſ of the Reviewers to ſet every wrongheaded Author right; or that they have arrogantly undertaken to ſupply every thing they may ſee wanting in the works of others. They think it in general ſuſficient that they point out the principal defects in the Performances of ſuch miſtaken Writers; vho would alie c ro   -  A a n An  n - : aũ : E E x X xy æ 599  rt òu t ; æita 9° mũ⸗ - - .- e , uſ Lſ pt ꝶ i ⸗ ⸗ æ van tę⸗ .t u in  their errors, and growing impatient at well  meant reproof to ſubmit with temper, ant  lIarn to proſitiby juſt &rſection.

But they muſt not think to object, and object, and produce no proofs to the contrary as uſual, but Arguments more convincing will be expected, and ſuch as are ſupported with Ex periments: equally concluſive. iin       (a] And hy ſuch arrogancy, evaſions and —m intead of Argument, hey ſhuſſle off a ſerious and ſatsfacto: v reply.
