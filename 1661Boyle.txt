SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. B Y works in the history of science, a work which opens the modern period of chemistry and marks the end of the doctrine of the four elements of the Aristotelians. Charles Singer: Short History of Scientific Ideas to 1900. This famous and rare book (in over 30 years search the bibliographer of Boyle, the late John F. Fulton, located only 27 copies) has never been published in facsimile. Nor has the text of the first edition ever been reprinted. Since its original printing in 1661 the only editions have been the second of 1680 and the reprints of the second edition in the collected works of 1744 and 1772 and in the Everyman edition (191I). The copy photographed for this reprint agrees in every respect with the collation in Fultons bibliography.  This work established chemistry as the modern science it is today and ranks in importance in the history of science with Copernicus, Galileo and Newton. Printing and the Mind of Man Exhibit No. 274.

B Y The Honourable ROBERT BOTLE, Eſq; L O X D ON, Pprinted by 7. Caduell for 7. Croote, and are to be Sold at the Ship in St. Paul's Church- Yard. INTRODUCTORY To the following Treatiſe. XP O give the Reader an account,hy 2the following Treatiſe is ſufferd 8 t0 paſs abroad ſo maim, and imꝶòQ perfect, I maſt inform him that tis now long ſince, that to gra:ify an ingenious Gentleman, I ſet down ſome of the Reaſons that hept me from fully acquieſcing either inthe Periputetical, or in the Chymical Dostrine, of the Material Priuciples of mixt Bodies. This Diſcourſe ſome years after falling into the hands of ſome Learged men, had the go0dl luck to be ſo favourably receivd, and advantageouſly ſpoken of bythem, that having had more ihen ordinary Invitations given me to mate it publick, Ithought ſit to reviem it, that I might retrench ſome things that ſeemd not ſo fit to be ſvewn to every Reader, And ſubſtitute ſme of thoſe other things that œcurrd to me of A the Thę Uniereſy of lowa the tryals and otſervations I bad ſince made. what became of mypapers, Ielſemhere mention in a Preface where Icomplain of it: But ſince I mrit That, I found many ſbeeis that belong'd to the ſubjetis I am now about to diſcourſe of. hereſcre ſeeing that Ihad then in my hands as muth of tbe first Dialogue as was re quiſite to state the Caſe, and ſerve for an Introdustion as mell to the confererce tetwixt Carneade sand E]eu therius, as to ſome other Dialogues, which for certain reaſons are not now herewith publiſtd, I reſoldd to ſupply, as ell as Icould,the Contents of a Paper belonging to the ſecond of the following Diſcourſes, which I could not poſſibly retrive, though it were the chief of them all. And having once more tryd the Opinion of Friends, Lut not of the ſame, aboæt this imperfect work, I found it ſuch, that I as content in complyance ith their Deſires, that not only it ſbould Le publiſtd, but that it ſbould be publiſd as ſoon as conveniently might be. I had indeed all along the Dialogues ſpoen of my ſelf, as of a third Perſon ; For,they containing Diſcourſes which were among the ſirſt Treatiſes that Iventurd long azo to write of matters Philoſophical, I had reaſon to deſire,with the Painter,to latere pone tabulam, and bear what men would ſay of them, beſore I ovn'd my ſelf to be their Author. But beſides that now I fiud,tis not unknown to many who il is that rit them, Iam made to believe that tis not inexpedient, they ſbould be tnown to come from à Perſon not altogether a ſtranger to Chymical Aſfairs. And I madetthe leſſe ſcruple to let then come abroad uncompleated, partly,becauſe my affairs and Præ-ingagements to publiſb divers other Treatiſes allow'd me ſmall hopes of being able in agreat while to compleat theſe Dialogues. Ard partly, Lecauſe Iam not unapt to think, that they may come abroad ſeaſonably enough, though not r the Authors reputation, yet for other purpoſes. For Iobſerve, that of late Chymistry begins, as indeed it deſerves, to be culiivate q Learved Men who tefore deſjisa it ; and to be pretended to by many who never cul ivated it, that they may be thought not to ignone it : whence it is come to paſſe, that divers Clymical Notions about Matters Philoſiphical are taken for granted and employd, and ſo adipted by very eminent writers both Naturaliſis and Phyſitians. Now this I fear mayprove ſomewhat prejudicialto the Advancemest of ſolid Philoſophy : For though Iam a great Lover of Chymical Experiments, and though I have no mean esteem of divers Chymical Remedies, jet 1 diſtinguiſb theſe from their Notions about the cauſes of things, ad tleir manner of Generation. And for cught Ican hitherto diſcern, there are a thouſand Phænomena in Nature, beſides a Muliitude of Atcidets relating to the hamans Body,mhich willſcarcelybe clearly& ſutisfatiorilymade out bythem that confine themſelues to deduce thinge from Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, and the other Notions peculiar to the Chymisis, nithout taking much. more Notice than they are mont to do, of the Motians and Figures, of the ſmall Parti of Matter, and the other more Catholick and Fruitful affecticns of Bodies. herefore itwill not perhaps be now unſeaſonable to let our Carneades warne Men, not to ſubſcrite to the grand Doctrine of the Chynmiſis touching their three Hypoſtatical Principles, till they bave a litile examiv'd it. and conſiderd, how they can clear itfrom his Objcſtions, divers of whichtis lite they may never have thought on 3 ſince a Chymiſt ſcarce would, and none but a Clymiſt could propoſe them. Ihope alſo it ill not be unacceptable to ſeveral Ingenious Perſons, ho are unwilling to determine of any important Controverſie, ithout a previous confideration of what may be ſaid on hoth ſides, and yet have greater deſires to underſtand Chymical Matters, than Opportunities of learning them, to ſind here rogether,bèſides ſeveral Experiments of my own purposſely made to Illuftrate the Doctrine of the Elements, divers others ſcarce to be met with, otherwiſe then Scatterd among many Ch tiated Experiments ſo Deliver'd as ihat an Ordinary Reader, if he be but Acquainted with the uſuall Chymical Termes, may eoſily enough *nderstand Them; avd even a wary One may ſafely rely on Them. Theſe Things I add, tecauſe a Perſon any Thing vers'd in the writings of Chymists cannot but Diſcern by their obſcure, ambiguous, and almost ænigmatical wayof expreſſing what they pretend to Teach, that they have no Mind to be underſtood a all, but by the Sons of Art C as theycall them) nor to be linderſtood even by theſe mithout Difficulty and Hazardous Tryalls. Inſomuch ihat ſome of Them Scarce ever ſpeak ſo candialy, as when they mate uſe of that known Chymical Sentence 3 Ubi palam locuti ſumus, ibi nihil diximus. Anud as ihe olſturity of what ſome Writers deli uer makes it very difficult to be underſtood 3 ſo the énfaithfulneſi of too many others makes it unfit to be reld on. For thoughunmillingly, et Imust for the truths ſute, and the Readers, warne him not to be forward to believe Chymical Experiments whex they are ſet down oulyby way of Preſcriptions, and not of Relations ; that is, unleſs he that delivers them mentions his doing it upon his own particular nopledqe, or uponthe Relation of ſome credible perſon,avoming it upon his own experience,F or 1 am troubled, I muſt complain, that even Eminent writers, botb Phyſitians and Philoſophers, mhom I can eaſily name,ifit be requir d, have of late ſufferd ihemſelues to be ſo far imposd pon, as to Publiſb and Build upon Chymical Experiments,which queſtionleſi they never try d; for if theyhad, they would, as well as I, have found them not to be true. And indeed it ere to be iſbd, that now that thoſe begin to quote Chymical Experiments that are not themſelues Acquainted with Chymical Operations, men would Leave off that Indeſinite ay of Vouching the Chymisis ſaythis, or the Chymiſts afirme ihat, and iould rather for each Experiment they clledqe name the Author or Aathors, upon whoſe credit theyrelate it 3 For, by this means they would ſecure themſelues from the ſuſpition of falſbood (to which the other Practice Exoſes them) and they would Leatve the Reader to udge of what is 7 for him to Believe of hat is Deliverd, whilſt they employ not iheir own great names to Countenance doubtfull Relations; and they will alſo do Juſtice to the Inventors or Publiſters of true Experiments, as well as upon the Obtruders of falſe ones. whereas by tha: general way of quoting the Chymiſis, the candid Writer is Defrauded of the particular Praiſe, ond the Impoſtor eſcapes the Perſonal Diſgrace that is due to him. The remaining Part of this Præſace muſt be mployd in ſayiug ſomething for Carneades, and ſomething for my Sell. Aud firſt, Carneades hopes that he will be thought to have diſputed citilly and Modeſily enough for one that was to playthe Antagoniſt ond ihe Sceptich. And if he any where ſeem to ſleight his Adverſaries Tenents and Argumenis, he is willing to have it loobd upon as what he was induc'd to, not ſo much by his Opinion of them, as the Examples of Themiſtius anã Philoponus, and the cuftom of ſucl kind of Diſputes. Next, In caſe that ſome of his Argumenis ſvall not be thought of the mosſt Cogent ſort that may te, he hopes it will be conſider d that it ought not to be Expected,that they ſbould be So. For, his Part being chiefly but to propeſe Doubts and Scruples, be does enough, if he ſbews that his Adverſaries Arguments are net ſtrongly Concluding, though his ovn be not ſo neither. And if there ſbould appear anydiſagreement betwixt the things he delivers in divers paſſages, he hopes it will be conſiderd, that it is not neceſſarythat all the things a Sceptich Propoſes, ſbould be conſonant 3 ſince it being his work to Suggeſt doubts againſi the Opinion he queſtions, it is alloable for him to propoſe two or more ſeverall Hypotheſes zou the ſume thing: And to ſay that it may be accounted for this ay, or thar way, cr the other way,though theſe wayes be perhaps inconſiſtent among Themſelves. Becaoſe it is enough for him, if either of the propoſed Hypotheſes be but as protable asthat he calls a queftion. And if be propeſes manyibat aore Each of them probat le,he does the more ſcrisſie his doults, by mating it appear the more difficult to be ſure, that inat uhich they aluayes difſer from is ihe true. And our Carneades b6 holding the Negatite, he bas this Advantage,that if among allthe Instances he brings to invalidate all the Vulgar Dectrine of thoſe he Diſputes with,any one be Irrefragable, thut alone is ſuſficient to overthro⸗ a Doſtrine which éniverſally aſſerts what he oppoſes.For, it canmot be true,that all Bodies vhaiſoever that are reckod amorg the Perfeſily mixt Ones, are Compounded of ſuth a Determipate Numter of ſuch or ſuch Ingredients, in caſe any one ſucl budy can be produdd, that is net ſo compouuded ; and he hopes too, that Accuraeneſs ill be the Ieſs expected from him, lecauſe his undertating obliges him to maintain ſuch Opinioxs in Chymiſtry, and that chiefly by Chymical Arguments, as are Contrary to the very Principles of the Clymiſts; From hoſe writings it is not Therefore lite he ſbould receive any intentionall Aſistance, except from mont, with æhom he jet diſagrees in many things (which reduce him to explicate Divers Clyymical Phænomena, according to other Notions ;3 And of whoſe Ratiocinations, not enly ſome ſeem very Extravagant, but even the Rest are not wont to be as conſiderable as his Experiments, And thoagh it be True indeed, that ſome Ariſtotelians have occaſionally riit en againſt the Chymical Doẽtrine he Oppagnes, jet ſince they have done it according to their Principles, And ſince our Carneades muſt as well oppeſe their Hypotheſis as that of the Spagyrist,he mas fain to ſight his Adverſaries ith their own veapons, Thoſe of the Peripatetich being Improper, if not hurtfull for a Perſon of his Tenents 3 beſides that thoſe Ariſtotelians, (æ Least, theſe he met with,) that have written against the Chymiſis, ſeem to have had ſo little Experimental Knowledge in Chymical Muatters, that by their frequent Miſtates and unshilfull wayof Oppugning, they havue too often exposd Themſelues to the Derifion of iheir Adverſaries, for writing ſo Confidently against phat they appear ſo little to underſtand. And Lastly, Carneades hopes, he ſhall doe the Ingenious this Piece of ſervice, that by having Thus drawn the Chymists Dottrine out of their Dark and Smoatie Laboratories, and both neſs of their Proofs,that have titherto been wont to be brought for it,either Judicious Men ſhall benceforih be allowed calmlyand after due information to diſtelieve it, or thoſe abler Chymiſis, that are Zzealous for the reputation of it, will be obligd to ſpeak plainer then hitherto has been done, and maintain it by better Experimenis and Arguments ihben Theſe Carneades hals examind : ſo That he hopes, the Curious will one way or other Derive either ſatisfattion or instruttion from his endeavours. And as he is read) to mate good the profeſſion he mates in the cloſe of his Diſcourſe, he being ready to be better informd, ſo be expeſis either to be indeed informd, or to be let alone. For Though if any Traly knoing Chymiſts ſball Think fit in acivil and rational wayto ſbew him anytruth touching the matter in Diſpute That he yet diſcernes not, Carneades will not refuſe either to admit, or to own aConvigtion: jet if any impertinent Perſon ſball, either to get Himſelfa Nane,or for what other end ſcever, wilfully or careleſly miſtate the State of the Controverſie,or the ſence of his Arguments, or ſball rail inſtead of arguing, as hath been done of Late in Print by divers Chymists ; or laſtly, ſball write against them in acantinꝗ way ; I mean, ſball expreſs himſelf in ambigucus or obſcure termes, or argue from experiments not intelligibly enoxgh Deliverd, Carneades profeſſes, That he values his time ſo much, as not to thint the anſuering ſuch Trifles worth the loſs of it. And now having ſuid thus much for Carneades, I hope the Reader will give me leave to ſay ſomething too for my ſelf. Aud first, if ſome moroſe Readers ſball find fault with my hauing made the Interlocutors upou occaſion complement with one another, and that I have almost all along written theſe Dialegues in a ſtile more Faſhionable then That of meer ſcholars is ont to be, I hope I ſball be excusd ly ihem that ſhall conſider, that to heep a  ie decorum in the Diſcourſes,it was fit that in abook written by a Gentleman, and wherein oBly Geutlemen are introduc'd as ſyeakers , the Language ſvould be more ſinooth, and the Expreſſions more civilthan is uſual in the more Scholastick way of writing. And indeed, I am not ſorry to have this Opportunity of giving anexample how to manage even Diſputes with Civility 3 whence perbaps ſome Readers will be aſfiſted to diſcern a Diſference betwixt Bluntneſs of ſpeech and Strengibof reaſon, and find ibat ẽ man may be a Champion for Truth,itbout being an Enemyto Civility;and may confute an Opinion without railing at Them that hold it 3To hom be that deſires to convince and not to provoe vility to their Perſons, for his ſeverity to their miſ; and muſt ſ/ as ſittle 5t a he can, to diſpleaſe them,when be ſays that ttey are in an error. But perhaps other Readers uill be leſs apt to find fault ith the Civility of my Diſputants, than the Chymiis will Le, ipoi the reading of ſoie Paſſages of tte following Dialogue,to acciſe Carneades of Aſperity. but if I bave made ry Sceptic ſome: ime3 ſpeàl ſeighſingly of the Opinions he oppoſes, Ihope it will not be found that Ibave done any more, than became the Part he as to ati of an Opponent: E ſpectally uhat Ihave made hit ſay be compar dith what the Prince of the Romane Orators himſelf mates both great Perſons and Friends ſay of one anoiters Opinions, in his excellent Dialogies, De Natura Deorum: 4nd Inall ſcarce be ſuſpeted of Partiality, in the caſe, by them that tae Notice that tFere is full as mucb (if not far more) liberty of ſeighting their Adverſaries Tenents ſo be mẽt æſth in the Diſcourſes of thoſe with whon Carneades diſputes. Nor needed I male the Interlocutors ſpeat otherwiſe then freely in a Dialogne, wherein it va ſufficiently intiniated, that ITreant not to declare my own Opinion of the Arguments preposd, much leſſe of thè whole Controverſy it ſelf otteruiſe than as it may by an attentive Reader te gneſs d at by ſome Paſſages of Carneades: U ſay, ſomte Paſſates, becauſe Imae not all that he ſays, eſpecially in the Eeat of Diſputation, mine;) partly in this Diſcourſe, and parily in ſome nther Dialogues betuixt the ſume ſpeakers (though they treat net imutediately of tFe Elements) which bave long layn by me, and expeti the Entertainment that theſe preſent Diſcourſes will meet ith. And indeed they will Fiuch mijiake me, that ſrall conclude from what Inow publiſv, that Iam at Deſjane æith Chymiſiry, or would make my Readers ſo. Inope the Specimina Ihave lately publiſid of an attempt to ſoeu the uſefulneſs of Chymical Experiments to Contemplative Philo ophers,will give thoſe that ſrallreadthem other thoughts of me: & Thad a deſqn (but wanted qʒportunity) to publiſi with theſe Papers an Eſſay I have bying by me, the greãter part of which is Apolegetical for ne ſort of Chyuts. And at leajt, o for thoſe that know me, Thopẽ the painſ have taken in the fire will both convince them, that Iam far from being an Enemy to the Chymiiis Art, (thorgh Iam no friend to many that diſgrace it by profeſſing it,) and pervade them ts believe mè when I declare that I ditiinguiſo betwixt thoſe Chymiis that are either Cheats, or but Laborants, and the true Adepti; By whom, could Ienjoy their Converſaticn, Ivould both willingly and thankfully be iniirutieds; eſpecially concerning the Nature and Generat ion of Merals : And poſibly, thoſe that know hov little I have remitted of niy former addieãneſs to make Chymical Experiments,æill eaſily believe,that one of the chief Deſignes of this Sceptical Diſcourſe »as, not ſomich to difcredit Chymiſiry,  to give an occaſien and a kind of neceſſity to the more Rnowing Artiſis to lay aſide a little of their overgreat Relervedneſs.& either explicate orprove the Chymical Theory better than ordinaryChymiſis have crets to euince that Their art is able to mate amenas even for the deficiencies of their Theory: And thus much I ſball bere mate bold to add,that we ſball much undervalue Chymiſtry, if we imagine, that it cannot teach us things farr more uſeful,not only to Phyſick but to Philoſophy,than thoſe that are hithertò knon to vulgar ⸗ ſts. And jes as for inferiour Spagyrifis ihemſelues, ihey have by their labours deſervæ ſo well of the Common-wealih of Learning, that me: hinks tis Pity they ſbould ever miſſe the Truth uhich they have ſo induſtriouſly ſought. And though I belns Adnirer of the Theorical Part of their Art, y0my conjectures will much deceive me, iftbe Practical Part be not much more cultivated ihan hitherto it has been, and do not botl employ Philoſophy and Philoſophers, and help to nate men ſuch. Nor would I that have been diverted by other Studies as well as affairs,be thought to pretend being a profound Sparyrist, by finding ſo many fauls in the Doctrine wherein the Generality of Chyniſis ſcruples vot to Acquieſce: For beſidesthat tis moſt commonly for eaſier to frame Objections against any proposd Hypotheſis, than to propoſe as Hypotheſis æot lyal le to Objections Leſides this Iſay) tis no ſuch great natter, if whereas Beginners in Chymiſtry are commonly at once imbi'd with the Theory and Operations of their profeſſion, I mho had ihæ good Portune to Learn the Operations from illiterate Perſcns, upon ol credit Ias not Tempted to take up anyopinion about them,ſbould conſider things with leſſe prejudice, and conſequently ith other Ejes than the Generality of Learners 3 And ſbould be more diſposd to accommodate the Phænomena that occurd to me to other Notions ihan to theſe of the Spagyrits. And having a fir5t entertaind a ſuſvition Tha; the Vulgar Principles were Iſſe General and comprehenſive, or leſſe conſiderately Deduc'd from Chymical Operations, than was believd 37 it was not uneaſie for me both to Take notice of divers Phænomena, overloobd by prepoſſest Perſuns, that ſeeWd not to ſuite ſo well with the Hermetical Doctrine3 and, to deviſe ſime Experiments likely to furniſb me ith Objections against it, not known to nany, that having practisd Chymiſry longer perchance then I bave yet livd, may have - more Experience, Than I, of particular proceſies. To conclude, whether the Notions I have proposd, and the Experiments Ihave commuricated, be conſiderable, or not, Ivillingly leave others to Judge 3 and This only I ſhall ſay fyr my Self, That Ihave endeavourd to deliver matters of Faſt, ſo faithfally, that T may as well aſiſt the leſſe stilful Readers to examine he Chynical Hypotheſis, as provote ihe Spagyrical Philoſophers to illuſtrate it : which if they do, and that either ihe Chymical opimon, or the Peripatetict, or any other Theory of the Elemenis differing from that Iam moſt inclivd to, ſball be intelligitly explicated, and duly provd to me; what I have hitherto diſcoursd will not hinder it from mating a Proſelyte of a Perſon that Loves Fluẽluation of Judgment litile enough to  a PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS Touching The experiments wont to be employed to evince either the IV Peripatetick Elements, or the III Chymical Principles of Mixt Bodies. Part of the Firſt Dialogue. 3 Perceive that divers of my 3 Iẽ Friends have thought it rery ꝶ ſtrange to hear me ſpeak ſo 5n ireſolvedly, as I have been wont to do, concerning thoſe things hich ſome take tobe the Elements, and others to be the Principles of all mixe Bodies. But I bluſh not to acknowledge that I much leſſe ſcuple to confeſs that I Doubt, whenIdo ſo, then to profeſs that I Know what Ido not: And I ſhonld have much ſtronger Expectations thenI dare yet entertain, to ſee Philoſophy ſolidly eſtabliſt, if men would more carefully diſtinguiſn thoſe things that they know, from thoſe that they ignore or do but think, and then explicate clearly the things they conceive they underſtand, acknowledge ingenuouſly what it is they ignore, and proſeſs ſo candidly their Doubts, that the induſtry of intelligent perſons might be ſer on work to make further enquiries, and the eaſineſs of leſs diſcerning Men might not be impos'd on. But becauſe a more particular accompt will probably be expected of my unſatisfyedneſs not only with the Peripatetick, but with the Chymical Doctrine of the Primitive Ingredients of Bodies: It may poſſibly ſerve to ſatisſy others of the excuſableneſs of my diſatisfaction to peruſe the enſuing Relation of what paſſed a while ſince at a meeting of perſons of ſcveral opinions, in a place that need not here be named ; where the ſubject whereof we have been ſpeaking, was amply and vari ouſly diſcoursd of. It was on one of the faireſt dayes of this Summer that the inquiſitive Eleatherius came to invite me to make a viſit with him to his friend Carneades. I readily conſented to this motion, telling him that if he would but permit me to go ſirſt and make an excuſc at a place not far off, where I had at that hour appointed to meet, but not about a buſineſs either of moment, or that could not well admit of a delay, I would preſently wait on him, becauſe of my knowing Carneades to be ſo converſant with nature and with Furnaces, and ſo unconfind to vulgar Opinions, that he would probably by ſome ingenious Paradox or other, give our mindes at leaſt a pleaſing Exercile, and perhaps entich them with ſome ſolid inſtruction. Eleutherius then firſt going with me to the place where iny Apology was to be made, I accompanicd him to the lodging of Carneades, where when we were come, we were told by the Servants, that he was retired with a couple of Friends ( whole names they alſo toldus) to one of the Arbours in his Garden, to enjoyunder its coole ſhades a delightful protection from the yet troubleſome heat of the Sun. Eleutherius being perfectly acquainted with that Garden immediately led me to the Arbour, and relying on the intimate ſamiliatity that had been long cheriſyd betwixt him and Carncades3 in ſpight of my Reluctancy to what might ]ook like an intruſion upon his privacy, drawing me by the hand, he abruptly entered the Arbour, where we found Carneades, Philoponus, anò Themiſtius, ſitting cloſe about a little round Table, on which beſides paper, pen, and inke, there lay two or three open Books; Carneades appeared not at all troubled at this ſurpriſe, but riſing ſrom the Table, received his Friend with open looks and armes, and welcoming me alſo with his wonted ſreedom and civility, invited us to reſt our ielves by him, which, as ſoon as we had exchanged with his two Friends (who ere ours alſo) the civilities accuſtomed on ſuch occaſions, ve did. And he preſently aſter we had ſeated our ſelves, ſhutting the Books that lay open, and turning to us with a ſmiling countenance ſeemed ready to begin ſome ſuch unconcerning diſcourſe as is wont to paſs or rather waſte the time in promiſcuous But Eleutherius gueſſing at what he meant to do, prevented him by telling him, I perceive Carneades by the books that you have been now ſhutting, and much more by the poſture wherein I found Perſons qualifi'd to diſcourſe of ſerious matters, and ſo accuſtomd to do it, that you three were before our coming, engagd in ſome Philoſophical conference, which I hope you will either proſecute, and allow us to be partakers of, in recompence of the freedome we have usd in preſuming to ſurpriſe you, or elſe give us leave to repair the injury we ſhould otherwiſe do you, by leaving you to the freedom we have interrupted, and puniſhing our ſelves for our boldneſs by depriving our ſelves of the happineſs of your company. With theſe laſt words he and Iroſe up, as if we meant to be gone, But Carneades ſuddenly laying hold on his arme, and ſtopping him by it, ſmileingly told him, We are not ſo forward to loſe good company as you ſeem to imagine; eſpecially ſince ycu are pleasd to deſire to be preſent at what we ſhall ſay, about ſuch a Subject as that You found us conſidering. For that, being the number of the Elements, Principles, or Materiall Ingredients of Bodies, is an enquiry whoſe truth is of that Importance, and of that Diſficulty, that it may as well deſerve as require to be ſearched into by ſuchskilſull Indagators of Nature as your ſelves. And therefore we ſent to invite the bold and acutc Leacippus to lend us ſome light by his Atomical Paradox, upon which we expected ſuch pregnant hints, thattwas not without a great deal of trouble that we had lately word brought us that he was not to be found;and we had likewiſe begęQd the Aſſiſtance of your preſence and thoughts, had not the meſſenger we employd to Leucippus informd us, that as he was going, he ſaw you both paſs by towards another part of the Town; And this ſruſtrated expectation of Leucippus his company, who told me but laſt night that he would be ready to give me a meeting where I pleasd to day, having very long ſuſpended our conference about the heſhly mention'd Subject, it was ſo newly begun when you came in, that we ſhall ſcarce need to repeat any thing to acquaint you with what has paſs'd betwixt us before your arrival, ſo that I cannot but look upon it as a fortunate Accident that you ſhould come ſo ſeaſonably, to be not hearers alone, but we hope Interlocutors at our conference. For we ſhall not only allow of your preſence at it, but deſire your Aſſiſtance in it 3 which I adde both for other reaſons, and becauſe though theſe learned Gentlemen (ſayes he, turning to his two ſriends) need not fear to diſcourſe before any Auditory, provided it be intelligent enough to underſtand them, yet for my part (continues he with a new ſmile,) I ſhall not dare to vent my unpremeditated thoughts before two ſuch Criticks, unleſs by promiſing to take your turnes of Ipeaking, You will allow me mine of quarrelſing, with what has been ſaid. He and his friends added divers things to convince us that they were both deſirous that we ſhould hear them, and reſolved againſt our doing ſo, unleſs we allowed them ſometimes to hear us. Elutherius after having a while fruitleſly endeavoured to obtain leave to be ſilent promis'd he would not te ſoalwayes, provided that he were permitted according 1o the freedom of his Genious and Principles to ſide with ono of them in the managing of one Armenr, and, if he ſaw cauſe, with his ntagoniſt, in the Proſecution of another, without being confin'd to ſlick to any one party or Opinion, which was aſter ſome debate accorded him. But I conſcious to my own Diſability's told them reſolutely that I was as much more willing as more fit to be a hearer then a ſpeaker, among ſuch knowing Perſons, and on ſo abſtruſe a Subject. And that therefore I beſeeched them without neceſſitating me to proclaim my weakneſſes, to allow me to leſſen them by being a ſilent Auditor of their Diſcourſes: to ſuffer me to be at which I could preſent them no motive, ſave that their inſtructions would make them in me a more intelligent Admirer. I added, that I deſir'd not to be idle whilſt they were imployd, but would if they pleas'd, by writing down in ſhort hand what ſhould be delivered, preſerve Diſcourſes that I knew would merit to be laſting. At firſt Carneades and his two friends utterly rejected this motion; and all that my Reſolutenels to make uſe of my ears, not tongue, at their debates, could do, was to make them acquieſce in the Propoſition of Eleutherius, who thinking himſelf concerd, becauſe he bronght me thither, to afford me ſeme faint aſſiſtance, was content that I ſhould regiſter their Arguments, that I might be the better able aſter the concluſion of their conference to give them m ſence upon the Subjc&t of irt, (The number of Elements or Principles:) which he promisd I ſhould do at the end of the preſent Debates, if time would permit, or elſe at our next meeting. And this being by him undertaken in my name, though without my conſent, the company would by no means receive my Proteſtation againſt it, but caſting, all at once, their eyes on Carneades, they did by that and their unanimous ſilence, invite him to begin; which (after a ſhort pauſe, during which he turnd himſelf to Eleutberius and me) he did in this manncr. Notwithſtanding the ſubtile reaſonings I have met with in the books of the Peripateticks, and the pretty experiments that have been ſhew'd me in the Laboratories of Chymiſis, 1 am of ſo diffident, or dull a Nature, as to think that if neither of them can bring more cogent arguments to evince the truth of their aſſertion then are wont to be brought;a Man may rationally enough retain ſome doubts concerning the very number of thoſe materiall Ingredients of mixt bodies, which ſome would have us call Elements, and others principles. Indeed when I conſidered that the Tenents concerning the Elements are as conſiderable amongſt the Doctrines of natural Philoſophy as the Elements themſelves are among the bodies of the Univerſe, I expected to find thoſe Opinions ſolidly eſtabliſi'd, upon which ſo many others are ſuperſtructed. But whenI took the pains imparti illy to examine the bodies themſelves that are ſaid to reſult from the blended Elements, and to torture them into a confeſſion of their conſtituent Principles, I was quickly inducd to think that the number of the Elements has been contended about by Philoſophers with more earneſtneſs then ſucceſs. This unſatisfiedneſls of mine has been much wonderd at, by theſe two Gentlemen us and Philoponus) who though they differ almoſt as much betwixt themſelves about the queſtion we are to conſider, as I do from either of them, yet thr.y both agree very well in this, that nere is a determinate number of ſuch ingredients as I was juſt now ſpeaking of, and that what that number is, Iſay not, may be ( for what may not ſuch as they perſwade ?2) but is wont to be clearly enough demonſtrated both by Reaſon and Experience. This has occaſion'd our preſent Conference. For our Diſcourſe this aſternoon, having fallen ſrom one ſubjcct to another, and at length ſet'd on this, they profferd to demonſtrate to me, each of them the truth of his opinion, out of both the Topicks that I have ſreſhly nam. But on the former(that of Reaſon ſtrictly ſo taken) we declind inſiſting at the preſent, Ieſt we ſhould not have time enough be fore ſupper to go thorough the Reaſons and Experiments too. The latter of which we unanimouſly thought the moſt reqũiſite to be ſcriouſly examind. Imuſt deſire you then to take notice Gentlemen (continued Carræeades) that my preſent buſineſs doth oblige me ſo to declare my own opinion on the Subject in queſtion, as to aſſert or deny the truth either of the Peripatetick, or the Chymical Doctrine concerning the number of the Elements, but only to ſhew you that neither of theſe Doctrines hath been ſatisfactorily proved by the arguments commonly alledged on its behalfe. So that if I really diſcern (as perhaps I think Ido) that there may be a more rational account then ordinary, given of one of theſe opinions, I am leſt free to declare my ſelf of it, norwithſtanding my preſent engagement, it being obvious to all your obſervation, that a ſolid truth may be generally maintained by no other, then incompetent Arguments. And to this Declaration I hope ſt will be needleſs to add, that my task obliges me not to anſwer the Arguments that may be drawn either for Themiſtius or Philopoæu55 Opinion from the Topick of reaſon, as oppoſed to experiments3 ſincętis theſe only that Iam to examine and not all theſe neither, but ſuch of them alone as either of them ſhall think fit to mſiſt on, and as have hitherto been wont to be brouZht either to prove that ii the four Peripatetick Elements, or that tis the three Chymical Principles that all compounded bodies conſiſt of. Theſe things (adds Carneades) I thought my ſelf obliged to premiſe, partly leſt you ſhould do theſe Gentlemen T pointing at Themistius and Philoponus, and ſmiling on them) the injury oſ meaſuring their parts by the arguments they arc ready to propoſe, the Iawes of our Conference confining them to make ule of thoſe that the vulgar of Philoſophers ( for even of them there is a vulgar) has drawn up to their hands; and partly, that you ſhould not condemn me of preſumption for diſputing againſt perſons over whom I can hope for no advantage, that 7 muſt not derive from the nature, or rules of our controverſy, wherein I have buta negative to defend, and wherein too I am like on ſeveral occaſions to have the Aſſiſtance of one of my diſagrecing adverſaries againſt the other. Philoponus and Themiſtius ſoon returned this complement with civilities of the like nature, in which Eleutherius perceiving them engaged, to prevent the ſurther loſs of that time of which they vere not like to have very much to ſpare, he minded them that their preſent buſineſſc was not to exchange complements, but Arguments: and then addreſſing his ſpeech to Carneades, l eſteem it no ſmall happineſſe (ſaies he) that I am come here ſo luckily this Evening. For I have been long disquieted with Doubts concerning this very ſubject which you are now ready to debate. And ſince a Queſtion of this importance is to be now dilcuſſed by perſons that maintain ſuch variety of opinions concerning it, and are both ſo able to enquire aſter truth, and ſo ready ro embrace it by whomſoever and on what occaſion ſoẽver it is preſented rhem; I cannot but promiſe my ſelf that Iſhallbefore we part either loſe my Doubts or the hopes of ever finding them reſolved : Eleatherius pauſed not here3 but to prevẽnt their anſwer, added almoſt in the ſame breath3 and I am not a little pleaſed to find that you are reſolved on this occaſion to inſiſt rather on Experiments then Syllogiſmes. For I, and no doubt You, have long obſerved, that thoſe Dialectical ſubtleties, that the Schoolmen too often employ about Phyſiological Myſteries, are wont much more to declare the wit of him that uſes them, then increaſe the knowledge orremove the doubts of ſober lovers of truth. Ana ſuch captious ſubtleties do indeed often puzzle and ſometimes ſilence men, but rarely ſatisfy them. Being like the tricks of Jugglers, whereby men doubt not but they are cheated, though oftentimes they cannot declare by what ſlights they are impoſed on. And therefore I think you have done very wiſely to make it your buſineſſe to conſider the Phænomena relating to the preſent Queſtion, which have been aſforded by experiments, eſpecially ſince it might ſecm injurious to our ſenſes, by whoſe mediation we acquire ſo much of the knowledge we have of things corporal, to have recourſe to far-fetche d and abſtracted Ratiocination, to know what are the ſenſible ingredients of thoſe ſenſible things that we daily ſee and handle, and are ſuppoſed to have the liberty to untwiſt (if I may ſo ſpeak) into the primitive bodies they conſiſt of. He annexed that he wiſhed thereſore they would no longer delay his expected ſatisfaction, if they had not, as he feared they had, forgotten ſomething preparatory to their debate; and that was 1o lay down what ſhould be all along underſtood by the word Principle or Element. Carneades thank'd him for his admonition, but told him that they had not been unmindſul of ſo requiſite a thing. But that being Gentlemen and very far from the litigious humour of loving to wrangle about words or terms or notions as empty; they had before his coming in, readily agreed promiſcuouſly to uſe when they pleaſed, Elements and Principles as terms equivalent: and to underſtand both by the one and the other, thoſe primitive and ſimple Bodies of which the mixt ones are ſaid to be comoſed, and into which they ate ultimatey reſolved. And upon the ſame account (he added) we agreed to diſcourſe of the opinions to be debated, as we have foud them maintained by the Generality of the aſſertors of the four Elements of the one party, and of thoſe that reccive the three Principles on the other, without tying our ſelves to enquire ſcrupulouſlv wnat notion cither Ariftotle or Paracelſus,or this or that Interpreter, or ſollower of cither oſ thoſe great perſons, framed of Elements or Principles; our de ſign being to examine, not what theſe or thoſe writers thought or taught, but what we find to be the obvious and moſt general opinion of thoſe, who are willing to be accounted Favourers of the Peripatetick or Chymical Doctrine, concerning this ſubject. I ſec not (ſaies Eleutherius) why you might not immediately begin to argue, if you were but agreed which of your two ſriendly Adverſaries ſnall be firſt heard. And it being quickly 1eſolv'd on that Themistius hould firſt propoſe the Prooſs for his Opinion, becauſe it was the antienter, and the more general, he made not the company cxpect long before he thus addreſſed himſelſ to Eleutherius, as to the Perſon Jeaſt intereſſed in the diſpute. If you have taken ſufficient notice of the late Confeſſion which was made by Carreades, and which (though his Civility dreſſed it up in complementall Expreſſions) was exacted of him by his Juſtice, I ſuppoſe You will be eaſily made ſenſible, that I engage in this Controverſie with great and peculiar Diſadvantages, beſides thoſc which his Parts and my Perſonal Diſabilities would bring to any other cauſe to be maintained by me againſt him. For he juſtly apprehending the force of truil, thouZh ſpeaking by no better a tongue then mine, hus made it the chief condition of our Ducll, that Iſhould lay aſide the beſt Weapons I have, and thoſc Ican beſt handle; Wihereas if I were allowed the freedom, in pleading for the ſour Elements, to employ the Arguments ſuggeſted to me by Reaſon to demonſtrate them, I ſhculd almoſt as little doubt of maling You a Proſelyte to thoſe unſeverd Teachers, Truth and Ariſtotle, as I do of your Candour and your Judgment. And I hope you will howe ver conſider, that that great Favorite and Interpreter oſ Nature, Arislotle, ho was (as his Organum witneſſes) the greateſt Maſter of Logick that ever livd, diſclaimd the courſe taken by other petty Philoſophers (Antient and Modern) who not attending the Coherence and Conſequences of their Opinions, arc more ſollicitous to make cach particular Opinion plauſible independently upon the the reſt, then to frame them all ſo, as not only to be conſiſtent together, hut to ſupport each other. For that great Man in his vaſt and comprehenſive Intellect, ſo framd each of his Notions, that being curiouſly adapted into onc Syſteme, they need not each of them any other defence then that which their mutuall Coherence gives them: As tis in an Arch, where each ſingle ſtone, wtich if ſeverd from the reſt would be perhaps defenceleſs, is ſufficiently ſecud by the ſolidity and entireneis of the whole Fabrick of which it is a part. How juſtly this may be applyd to the preſent cale, I could eaſily ſew You, if I were permitted to declare 10 You, how harmonious Ariſtorles Doctrine of the Elements is with his other Principles of Philoſophy; and how rationally he has deduc'd their number from that of the combinations of the four firſt Qualities from the kinds of ſimple Motion belonging to ſimple bodies, and from Iknow not how many other Principles andPhænomena of Nature, which ſo conſpire with his Doctrine of the Elements, that they mutually ſtrengthen and ſupport each other. But ſincetis ſorbidden me to inſiſt on Reſlections of this kind, I muſt proceed to tell You, that though the Aſſertors of the four Elements value Reaſon ſo highly, and are ſurniſd with Arguments cnough drawn ſrom thence, to be ſatisfi'd that there muſt be four Elements, though no Man had ever yet made any ſenſible tryal to diſcover theit Number, yet they are not deſtitute o? Experience to ſatisfic others that are wont to be more ſway'd by their ſenſes then their Reaſon. And I ſmall proceed to conſider the teſtimony o? Experience, when I ſhall have firſt advertis'd You, that if Men were as perfectly rational as tis to be viſ'd they were, this ſenſible way of Probation would be as needleſs astis wont to be imperſcct. For it is much more high and Philoſophical to diſcover things a priore, then a posteriore. And therefore the Peripateticks have not been very ſollicitous to gather Experiments to prove their Doctrines, contenting themſelves witha few only, to ſatisſie thoſe that are not capable of a Nobler Convidtion. And indeed they employ Experiments rather to ilJuſtrate then to demonſtrate their Doctrines, as Aſtronomers uſc Sphæres ties of ſuch as muſt be taught by their ſenſes, for want of being arrivd to a clcar apprehenſion of purely Maihematical Notions and Truths. Iſpeak thus Eleutberius (adds Themiftius) on]y to do right to Reafon, and not out of Diffidence of the Experimental proof l am to alledge. For though I ſhall name but one, yet it is ſuech a one as will make all other appear as needleſs as it ſclf will be found Satisfactory. For if You but conſider a piece of greenWood burning in a Chimney, You will readily diſcern in the disbanded parts of it the four Elements, of which we teach It and orher mixt bodics to be compos’d. The ſire diſcovers it ſelf in the flame by its own light; the ſmoke by aſcending to the top of the chimney, and there readily vaniſhing into air, like a River loſing it ſelf in the Sca, ſuſficiently manifeſts to what Element it belongs and gladly returnes. The water in its own form boyling and hiſſing at the ends of the burning Wood betrayes it ſelf to more then one of our ſenſes; and the aſhes by their weighe, their firineſs, and their dryncſs, put it paſt doubt that they belong to the Element of Earth. It I ſpoke (continues Themiſtius) to leſs knowing Perſens, I would perhaps make ſome Excuſe for building upon ſuch an obvious and eaſie Analyſis, but tould be, l fear, injurious, not to think ſuch an Apology needieſ to You, who are too judicious cither to think it neceſſary that Experiments to prove obvious truths ſhould be farr fetchd, or to wonder that among ſo many mixt Bodies that are compounded of che four Elements, ſome of them ſhould upon a ſlight Analyſis manifeſtly exhibite the Ingredients they conſiſt of. Eſpecially ſince it is very agrecable to the Goodneſs of Nature, to diſcloſe, even in ſome of the moſt ebvious Experiments that Men make, a Truth ſo important, and ſo requiſite to be taken notice oſ by them. Beſides that our 4nalyſis by how much the more obvious we make it, by ſo much the more ſuittable it will be 10 the Nature of that Doctrine whichtis alledged to prove, which being as clear and intelligible to the Underſtanding as obvious to the ſonſe, tis no marvail the learned part of Mankind ſbould ſo long and ſo generally imbrace it. For this Doctrine is very different from the whimſeys of Chymiſits and other Modern Innovators, of whoſe Hjotheſes we may obſerve, as Nauuraeliſts do of leſs perfcct Animals, that as they are haſtily formd, ſo they are commonly ſhort livd. For ſo theſe, as they are often fram'd in one week, are perhaps thought fit to be laughed at the next; and being built perchance but upon two or three Experimerits are deſtroyed by a third or fourth, whereas the doctrine of the four Elements was framd by Aristotle aſter he had leaſurely conſidered thoſe Theories of former Philoſophers, which are now with great applauſe revived, as diſcovered by theſe latter ages And had ſo judiciouſly detected and ſupplyed the Errors and defects of former H;p0theſes concerning the Elements, that his Doctrine of them has been ever ſince deſervedly cnibraced by the letter'd part of Mankind: All the Philoſophers that preceded him having in their ſcveral ages contributed to the compleatneſs of this Doctrine, as thoſe of ſueceeding times have acquieſcd in ir. Nor has an Hypotheſis ſo deliberately and maturely eſtabliſhed been called in QueitiC4 on till in the lat Century Paracelſus and ſome few other ſoory Empiricks, rather then (asthey are tain to call themſelves) Philoſophers, having their eyes darken'd, and their Brains troubl'd with the ſmoke of their own Furnaces, began to rail at the Peripatetick Doctrine, which they were too illiterate to underſtand, and to tell the credulous World, that they could ſee but three Ingredients in mixt Bodies 3 hich to gain themſelves the repute of Inventors, thev endeavoured to diſguiſe by calling them, inſtead of Earth, and Fire, and Vapour, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; to which they gave the canting title of Hypoſtatical Principles: but when they came to deſcribe them, they ſhewed ho little they underſtood what they meant by them, by diſagreeing as much ſrom one another, as from the truth they agreed in oppoſing: For thev deliver their Hypotheſes as darkly as their Proceſſes; and tis almoſt as impoſſible for any ſober Man to find their meaning, astis for them to find their Elixir. And indeed norhing has ſpread their Philoſophy, but their great Brags and undertakings; notwithſtanding us ſmiling) I ſcarce know any thing they have performed worth wondering at, ſave that they have been able to draw Philoponus to their Party, and to engage him to the Defence oſ an unintelligible Hypothe ſis, who knowes ſo well as he does, that Principles ought to be like Diamonds, as well very clear, as perfectly ſolid. Themistius having aſter theſc laſt words declared by his ſilence, thar he had finiſhed his Diſcourſe, Carreades addreſſing himſelf, as his Adverſary had done, to E leutherius, returned this Anſwer to its Ihop'd for Demonſtration, but I perceive Themi ftius hopes to put me oſt with a Harangue, wherein he cannot have given me a greater Opinion of his Parts, then he has given me Diſtruſt for his H,potheſis, ſince for it even a Man oſ ſuch Learning can bring no better Arguments. The Rhetorical part of his Diſcourſe, though it make not the leaſt part of it, I ſhall ſay nothing to, deſigning to cxamine only the Argumentative part, and leaving it to Philoponus to anſwer thoſe paſſages wherein either Pæracelſus or Chymifts are concorn'd: Iſhall obſcrve to You, that in what he has ſaid beſides, he makes it his Buſineſs to do theſe two things. The one to propoſe and muake out an Experiment to demonſtrate the common Opinion about the four Elements3 And the other, to inſinuate divers things which he thinks may repair the weakneſs of his Argument, from Experience, and upon other Accounts bring ſome credit to the otherwiſe defenceleſs Doctrine he mainuins. To begin then with his Experiment of the burning Wood, it ſcerns to me to bæ obnoxious to not a few conſiderable Exceptions. And firſt, if Iwould now deal rigidly with my Adverſary, I might here make a great Qcſtion of the very vay of Probation which he and others employ, withont the eaſt ſcruple, to evince, thas the Bodies commonly calld mixt, are made up of Ear:h, Air, Warer, and Fire, which rhev are pleas’d alſo to call Elements; namely that upon the ſuppos'd Analyſis made by the fire, of the former ſort of Concretes, there are wont to emerge Bodies reſembling thoſe which they take for the Elements. For not to Anticipate here whar I foreſee I ſhall have occaſionto inſiſt on, whenl come to diſcourſe with Philoponus concerning the right that fire has to paſs for the proper and Univerſal Inſtrument of Analyſing mixt Bodies, not to Anticipate that, I lay, if I were diſposd to wrangle, I might alledge, that by Themiſtius his Experiment it would appear rather that thoſe he calls Elements, are made of thoſe he calls mixt Bodies, then mixd Bodies of the Elements. For in Themistiuss Analy7?d Wood, and in other Bodies diſſipated and alter'd by the fire, it appears, and he confeſſes, that which he takes ſor Elementary Fire and Water, are made out of the Concrete; but it appears nor that the Concrete was made up of Fire and Water. Nor has either He, or any Man, for ought I know, of his perſwaſion, yet prov'd that nothing can be obtained from a Body by the ſire that was not Pre-exiſtent in it. At this inexpected objection, not only Themiſtius, but the reſt of the company appear'd not a little ſurpri?d; bur aſter a while Philoponus conceiving his opinion, as well as that of Ariſtotle, concerd in that Objection, You cannor ſure ( ſayes he to Carneades) propoſe this Diſficulty, not to call it Cavill, otherwiſc then as an Exerciſe of wit, and not as laying any weight upon it. For how can that be ſeparated from a thing that was not exiſtent in it. When, for inſtance, a Refiner mingles Gold and Lead, and expoſing this Mixture upon a Cuppell to the violence of the fire, thereby ſeparates it into pure and refulgent Gold and Lead (which driven off together with the Droſs of the Gold is thence call'd Lithargyrium Auri) can any man doubt that ſees theſe two ſo differing ſubſtances ſeparated ſrom the Maſs, that they were exiſtent in it before it was committed to the fire. I ſhould (replies Carneaães) allow your Argument to prove ſomething, if,as Men ſee the Refiners commonly take before hand both Lead and Gold to make the Maſs you ſpeak of, ſo we did ſee Nature pull down a parcell of the Element of Fire, that is fancyd to be plac'd I know not how many thouſand Leagues off,contiguous to the Orb of the Moon, and to blend it with a quantity of each of the three other Elements, to compoſe every mixt Body, upon whoſe Refolution ſhe Fire preſents us with Fire, and Earth, and the reſt. And let me add, Philoponu, that 10 make your Reaſoning cogent,. it muſt be firſt prov'd, that the fire do's only take the Elementary Ingredients aſunder, without otherwiſe altering them. For elſe tis obvious, that Bodics may afford ſubſtances which were not pre- exiſtent in them; as Fleſth to long kept produces Magots, and old Cheeſe Mites, whichI ſuppoſe you will not affirm to be Ingredients of thoſe Bodies. Now that fire dos not alwayes barely ſeparate the Elementary parts, but metimes at leaſt alter alſo the Ingredients of Bodies, iſI did not expcęt ere long a better occaſion to prove ĩt, I might make probable out of your very Inſtance, wherein there is nothing Elementary ſeparated by the great violence of the efiners fire: the Gold and Lead which are the two Ingredients ſeparated upon the Analyſis being conſcſſedly yet perfectly mixe Bodies, and the Litharge being Lead indeed ; but ſuch Lead as is differing in conſiftence and other Qualities from what it was before. To which I muſt add that I have ſometimes ſeen, and ſo queſtionleſſe have you much oſtener, ſome parcells of Glaſe adhering to the Teſt or Cuppel, and this Glaſs though Emergent as well as the Gold or Litharge upon your Analyſis, you will not I hope allow to have been a third Ingredient of the Maſs out of which the fire producdiit. Both Philoponus and Themiſtius were about to reply, when Eleutherius apprehending that the Proſecution of this Diſputc would take up time, which might be better employd, thought fit to prevent them by ſaying to Carneades: You made at leaſt half a Promiſe, when you firſt propos’d this Objcection, that you would not (now at leaſt) inſiſt on it, nor indeed does it ſcom to be of ab ſolute neceſſity to your cauſe, that you ſmould. For though you ſhould gram that there are Elements, it would not follow that there mult be preciſely four. And therefore I hope you will proceed to acquaint us with your other and more conſiderable Objections againſt Themiſtius's Opinion, eſpecially ſince there is To great a Diſproportion in Bulke betwixt the Earth, Water and Air, on the one part, and thoſe little parcells of reſombling rates from Corcretes on the other part, that I can ſcarce think that you are ſerious, when to Ioſe no advantage againſi our Adverſary, you ſcom to denyit to ſo mtional to conclude thelſe great ſimple Bodies to be the Elements, and not the Products of compounded ones. Wonhat you alledge ( replies Carneades) of the Vaſtneſ; of the Earth and Woater, has long ſince made me willing to allow them to be the greateſt and chief Maſſes of Matter to be met with re below: But Ithink I could ſhew You, if You would give me leave, that this will prove only that the Elemenis, as You call them, are the chieſ Bodies that make up the neighbouring part of the World, but not that they are ſuch Ingredients as every mixt Body muſt conſiſt of. Bur ſince You challenge me of ſomething of a Promiſe, though it be not an entire one, Yet I ſhall willingly perform it. And indeed lintended not when I firſt mention d this Objc ction, to inſiſt on it at preſent againſt Themistius, as I plainly intimated in my way of propoſing it:) being only deſirous 1ò let you ſee, that though I diſcer'd my Advantages, yer I was willing to forego ſome of them, rather then appear a rigid Adverſary of a Cauſe ſo weak, that it may with ſaſety be favourably dealt with. ButI muſt here profeſs, and deſire You to take Notice of it, that though I paſs on to another Argument, it is not becauſe I think this firſt invalid. For You will find in the Progreſs of our Diſpute, that I had ſome reaſon to queſtion the very way of Probation imploy'd both by Peripateticks and Chymiſts, to cvince the being and number of the Elements. For that there are ſuch, and that they are wont to be ſeparated by the Analyſis made by Fire, is indeed taken for granted by both Parties, but has not ( for ought I know) been ſo much as plauſibly attempted to be proved by cither. Hoping then that when we come to that part of our Debate, wherein Conſiderations relating to this Matter are to be treated of, you will remember what I have now ſaid, and that I do rather for a while ſuppole, then abſolutely grant the truth of what I have queſtion'd, I will proceed to another Objection. And hereupon Eleutherius having mis'd him not to be unmindſull, when time ſhould ſerve, of whãt he had declar'd. I conſider then (ſayes Carneades) in the next place, that there are divers Bodies out of which 7hemiſtius will not prove in haſte, that there can be ſo many Elements as four extracted by the Fire. And I ſhould perchance trouble him if Iſhould ask him what Peripatetick can ſhew us, (Iſay not, all the four Elements, for that would be too rigid a Queſtion, but) anyone of them extracted out of Gold by any degree of Fire whatſoever. Nor is Gold the only Bodie in Nature that would puzzle an Ariſtotelian, that is no more to analyZe by the Fire into Elementary Bodies, ince, for ought IT have yet obſerv'd, both Silver and calcin’d Venetian Talck, and ſome other Concretes, not neceſſary here to be namd, are ſo fixt, that to reduce any of them into four Heterogeneous Subſtances has hitherto prov'd a Task much too hard, not only for the Diſciples of Ariſtotle, but thoſe of Vulcan, at leaſt, whilſt the latter have employd only Fire to make the Analjſis. The next Argument (continues CarD neades) that I ſmall urge againſt Themiſtin's Opinion ſhall be this, That as there are divers Bodies whoſeAnalyſis by Fire cannot reduce them into ſo many Heterogencous Subſtances or Ingregredients as four, ſo there are others which may be reducd into more, as the Blood (and divers other parts) of Men and other Animals, which yield when analyæd five diſtinct Subſtances, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and Earth, as Experience has fnewn us in diſtilling Mans Blood, Harts-Horns, and divers other Bodies that belonging to the Animal- Kingdom abound with not uneaſily ſequeſtrable Salt.

Am ( ſayes Carneades) ſo unwilling I to deny Eleutherius any thing, that though, before the reſt of the Company Iam reſolv'd to make good the partI have undertaken of a Sceptick;3 yet I ſhall readily, ſince you will have it ſo, lay aſide for a while the Perſon of an Adverſary to the Peripateticks and Chymiſts3 and before I acquaint you with my Objections againſt their Opinions, acknowledge to you what may be (Whether truly or not) tollerably enough added, in favour of a certain number of Principles of mixt Bodies, to that grand and known Argument from the Analyi of compound Bodies, which I may poſſibly hereafter be able to conſute. And that you may the more caſily Examine, and the better Judge of what l have to ſay, Iſall caſt ĩt into a pretty number of diſtinct Propoſitions, to which Iſhall not premiſe any thing; becauſe Itake it for granted, that you need not be advertisd, that much of what I am to deliver, whether for or againſt a determinate number of Ingredſents of mixd Bodies, may be indifferently applyd to the four Peripatetick Elements, and the three Chymical Principles, though divers of my Objections will more peculiarly belong to theſe laſt nam'd, becauſe the Chymical Hypotheſis ſeeming to be much more countenancd by Experience then the orher, it ill be expedient to inſiſt chicfly upon the diſproving of that; eſpecially ſince moſt of the Arguments that are imployd againſt it, may, bya little variation, be made to conclude, at leaſt as ſtrongly againſt the leſs plauſible, 7:ſtotelian Doctrine. To proceed then to my Propoſitions, I ſhall begin with this, That It ſeems not abſurd to conceive that at the first Production of mixt Bodies, the lniverſal Matter whereof they among other Paris of the Univerſe conſiſted, mas actually divided into little Particles of ſeveral ſizes and ſhapes variouſly m7. This (ſaycs Carneades) I ſuppoſe you will eaſily enough allow. For beſides that which happens in the Generation, Corruption, Nutrition, and waſting of Bodies, that which we diſcover partly by our Aicroſcopes of the extream littleneſſe of even the ſcarce ſenſible parts of Concretes; and partly by the Chymical Reſolutions of mixt Bodies, and by divers other Operations of Spagyrical Fires upon them, ſeems ſufficiently to- manifeſt their conſiſting of parts very minute and of differing Figures. And that there does alſo intervene a vatious local Motion of ſuch ſmall Bodies, will ſcarce be denied3 whether we chuſe to grant the Origine of Concretions aſignd by Epicurus, or that related by Moſes. For the firſt, as you well know, ſuppoſes not only all mixt Bodies, but all others to be producd by the various and caſual occurſions of Atomes, moving themſelves to and fro by an internal Principle in the Immenſe or rather Infinite Vacuum. And as for the inſpir d Hiſtorian, He, informing us that the great and Wiſe Author oſ Things did not immediately create Plants, Beaſts, Birds, &c. but produc'd them out of thoſe portions of the pre-exiſtent, though created, Matter, that he calls Water and Earth, allows us to conceive, that the conſtituent Particles whereof theſe new Concretes were to conſiſt, were variouſly moved in order to their being connected into the Bodies they were, by their various Coalitions and Textures, to compoſe. But (continues Carneades) preſuming that the firſt Propoſition needs not be longer inſiſted on, I will paſs on to the ſecond, and tell you that Neither is it impoſſile that of theſe minute Porticles divers of 1he ſmalleſt and neighbouring ones were here and there aſſociated into minute Maſſes or Cluſters, and did by their Coslitions conſtitute tions or Maſſes as were not eafily diſſpable into ſuch Particles as composd them. To what maybe deduc'd, in favour of this Aſſertion, from the Natre of the Thing it ſelf, Iwill add ſomething out of Experience, which though I have not known it uſed to ſuch a purpoſe, ſeems to me more fairly 30 make out that there May be Elementary Bodies, then the more queſtionable Experiments of Peripatecets and Chymiſts prove that there Are ſuch. I conſider then that Gold will mix and be colliquated not onlywith Silver, Copper, ſin and Lead but with Antimony, Regulis Martis and many other Minerals, ith which it will compoſc Bodies very differing both from Gold, and the other Ingredients of the reſulting Concretes. And the ſame Gold will alſo by common Agua Regis, and (I ſpcak it knowingly) by divers other Menſtruums be re ucd into a ſeeming Liquor, in ſo much that the Corpuſcles of Gold will, with thoſe of the Menſtruum, paſs through Cap-Paper, and with them alſo coagulate into a Cryſtalline Salt. And I ſave further uryd, that with a ſmall quantity of a certain Saline Subſtance I prepard, Ican eaſily enough ſublime Gold into the form of red Cryſtalls of a conſiderable length; and many other wayes may Gold be diſguis'd, and help to conſtitute Bodies of very differing Natures both from It and from one another, and nevertheleſſe be afterward redud to the ſelf-ſame Numerical, Yellow, Fixt, Ponderous and Malleable Gold it was before its commixture. Nor is it only the fixedſt of Metals, but the moſt ſugitive, that I may employ in favour of our Propoſition: for Qikſilver vill with divers Mctals compoſe an 4malgam, with divers Menſtruums it ſcoms to be turn d into a Liquor, with Aqua fortis it will be brought into either a red or white Powder or precipitate, with Oyl of Vitriol into a pale Yellow one, with Sulphur it will compoſe a bloodred and volatile Cinaber, with ſome Saline Bodies it ill aſcend in form of a Salt which will be diſſoluble in water3 with Regulus of Antimony and Silver I have ſcen it ſublimd into a kinde ef Cryſtals, ith another Mixture Ireducd it into a malleable Body, into a hard and brirtle Subſtance by another: And fome there are who aſfirm, that by proper Additaments they can reduce Quicſilver into Oyl, nay into Glaſs, to mention no more. And yet out of all theſe exotick Compounds, we may recover the very ſame running Mercury that was the main Ingredient oſ them, and was ſo diſguiſd in them. Now the Reaſon (procceds Carneades) that I have repreſented theſe things concerning Gold and Quickſilver, is, That it may not appear abſurd to conceive, that ſuch little primary Maſſes or Cluſters, as our Propoſition mentions, may remain undiſſipated, notithſtanding their entring into the compoſition of various Concretions, ſince the Corpuſcle of Gold and Mercury, though they be not primary Concretions of the moſt minute Particles of matter, bur confeſſcdly mixt Bodies, are able to concurre plentiſull to the compoſition of ſeveral very ait fering Bodies, without loſing their own Nature or Texture, or having their cohæſion violated by the divorce of their aſſociated parts or Ingredients. Give me leave to add (ſayes Eleutteriu) on this occaſion, to what you now obſervd, that as confidently as ſome Chymiſts, and other modern Innovators in Philoſophy are wont to object againſt the Peripateticks, That from the mixture of their four Elements there could ariſe but an inconſiderable variety of compound Bodies; yet if the Ariſtoteliars were but halſ as well versd in the works of Nature as they are in the Writings of their Maſter, the proposd Objection would not ſo calmly triumph, as for want of Experiments they are fain to ſuffer it to do, For if we aſſigne to the Corpuſcles, whereof cach Element conſiſts, a peculiar ſize and ſhape, it ma calily enough be manifeſted, That ſuch differingly figurd Corpuſcles may be minglcd in ſuch various Proportions, and may be connected ſo many ſcveral wayes, that an almoſt incredible number of variouſly qualified Concretes may be composd of them. Eſpecially ſince the Corpuſcles of one Element may barely, by being aſſociated among themſelves, make up little Maſſes of diffcring ſize and figure from their conſtituent parts: and ſince alſo to the ſtrict union of ſuch minute Bodies there ſeems oftentimes nothing requiſite, beſides the bare Contact of a great part cf their Surfaces. And ho great a variety of Phænomena the ſame matter, without the addition of any other, and only ſeveral ways diſpos d or contexed, is able to exhibit, may partly appear by the multitude of differing Engins which by the contrivances of silſul Mechanitians, and the dexterity of expert Workmen, may be madẽ of Iron alone. But in our pręſent caſe being allowd to deduce compound Bodies ſrom four very differently qualitied ſorts of matter, he who ſhall bur conũder what you ſreſhly took notice of concerning the new Concretes reſulting from the mixture of incorporated Minerals, will ſcarce doubt but that the four Elements mannagd by Natures Skill may aſford a multitude of differing Compounds. Iam thus far of your minde (ſayes Carneades) that the Aristotelians might ith probability deduce a much greater number of compound Bodies from the mixture of their four Elements, than according to their preſent Hypotheſis they can, if inſtead of vainly aſtempting to deduce the variety and Properties of all mixt Bodies from the Combinations and Temperaments of the four Elements, as they are (among them) endowd with the four ſirſt Qualities, they had endeavoured to do it by the Eulk and Figure of the ſmallelt parts of thoſe ſuppoſed Elements. For from theſc more Catholick and Fruitſull Accidents of the Elementary matter may ſpring a great variety of Textures, upon whoſe Account a multitude of compound Bodies may very much differ from one another. And what Inow obſerve touching the four Peripatetick Elements, may be alſo applyed, mætatis matandis, as they ſpeak) to the Chymical Princiles. But (to take notice of that by the v) both the one and the other, muſt, I fear, call in to their aſſiſtance ſomething that is not Elementary, to excite or regulate the motion of the parts of the matter, and diſpoſc them after the manner requũſite to the Conſtitution of particular Concretes. For thar orherwiſe they are like to give us but a very imperfoct account of the Origine of very many mixt Bodies, It would, I think, be no hard matter to perſwade you, if it would not ſpend time, and were no Digreſſion, to examine, what they are wont to alledge of the Origine ot the Textures and Qualities of mixt Bodies, from a certain ſubſtantial Form, whoſe Origination they leave more obſcure than what iĩt is aſſumd to explicate. But to proceed to a new Propoſition. I ſhall not peremptorily deny,that from moſi of ſuch mixt Bodies as partake either of Aninal or Vegetable Nature, there may by the Help of the Fire, te aſluallyobtaind a determinate number Grhether Three, Four or Five, or fewer or more) of Subſtances, worthy of differing Denominations. Of the Experiments that induce me to make this Conceſſion, Iam like to have occaſion enough to mention ſeveral in the proſecution of my Diſcourſe. And therefore, that I may not hereaſter be oblig]d to trouble You and my ſelf with needleſs Repetitions, I ſhall now only deſire you to take notice of ſuch Experiments, when they ſhall be mention'd, and in your thoughts reſerre them hither. To theſe three Conceſſions I have but this Fourth to add, That It najy likemiſe be granted, that thoſe distinẽt Sutſtances, which Concretes generallyeither afford or are made up of, may without very much Inconvenience be calld ihe Elements or Principles of them. Wreen I ſaid, ithout very muth Intonvenience, ] had in my Thoughts that ſober Admonition of Galen, Cum de re conſiat, de verbis non eſt Litigandum. And thereſore alſo I ſcruple not to ſay Elements or Priuciples, partlv becauſe the Chymiſts are wont to call the Ingredients of mixt Bodies, Principles, as the Aristotelians name them Elements; I would here exclude neither. And, partly, becauſe it ſeems doubtfull whether the ſame Ingredients may not be calld Principles 2 às not being compounded of any more primary Bodies: andElements, in regard that all mixd Bodies are compounded of them. But I thought it requiſite to limit my Conceſſion by premiſing the words, very much, to the word Inconvenience, becauſe that though the Inconvenience of calling the diſtinct Subſtances, mention'd in the Propoſition Elements or Principles, be not very great, yet that it is an Impropriety of Speech, and conſcquently in a matter oſ this moment not to be altogether overlook'd, You will perhaps think, as well as I, by that time you ſhall have heard the ſollowing part of my Diſcourſe, by which you will beſt diſcern what Conſtruction to put upon the former Propoſitions, and how far they may be lookd upon, as things that Iconcede as true, and how far as things I only repreſent as ſpecious enough tobe fit to be conſiderd. And now Eleutherius (continues Carneades) I muſt reſume the perſon of a Sceptick, and as ſuch, propoſe ſome part of what may be either diſliXt, orat leaſt doubted of in the common Hytleſis of the Chymiſts: which if Iexamine with a little the more freedom, I hope I need not deſire you a Perſon to whom I have the Happineſſe of being ſo well known) to Iook upon ir as ſomething more ſuitable to the Employment whereto the Company has, for this Meeting, doom'd me; then eĩther to my Humour or my Cuſtom. Now though I might preſent you many things againſt che Vulgar Chymical Opinion of the three Principles, and ihe Experiments wont to be alledgd as Demonſtrations oſ it, yet thoſe I ſhall at preſent offer you may be conveniently enough comprehended in four Capital Conſiderations3 touching all which I ſhall only premiſe this in gerieral, That ſince it is not my preſent Task ſo much to aſſerc an Hypotheſis of my own, as to give an Account wherefore I ſuſpect the Truth of that of the Chymiſis, it ought not to be expected that all my Objections ſould be of the moſt cogent ſort, ſince it is reaſon enough to Doubt of a propos'd Opinion, that there appears no cogent Reaſon for it. To come then to the Objections themſelves; I conſider in the firſt place, That notwithſtanding what common Chymiſts have provd or taught, it may reaſonably enough be Doubted, how far, and in what ſence, Fire ought to be eſteemd the genuine and univerſal Inſtrument oſ analyzing mixt Bodies. This Doubt, you may remember, was formerly mentiond, but ſo tranſiently diſcours d of, that it will now be fit to inſiſt upon it And manifeſt that it was not ſo inconſiderately proposd as our Adverſaries then imagind. But, before I enter any farther into this Diſquiſition, Icannot but here take notice, that it were to be wiſrd, our Chymiſts had cleaily informd us what kinde of Diviſion of Bodies by Fire muſt determine the number of the Elements: For it is nothing near ſo eaſy as many ſeem to think, to determine diſtinctly the Effects of Heat, as Icould eaſily manifeſt, if Ihad leaſure to ſhew you how much the Operations of Fire may be diverſifyd by Circumſtances. But not wholly to paſs by a matter of this Importance, Iill firſt take notice to you, that Guajacum (for Inſtance) burnt with an open Fire in a Chimney, is ſequeſtred into Aſhes and Soot, whereas the ſame Wood diſtilld in a Retort does yield far other Heterogeneities, (to uſe the Helmontian expreſſion) and is reſolvd into Oyl, Spirit, Vinager, Water and Charcoal3 the laſt of which to be reduc'd into Aſhes, requires the being farther calcin d then it can be in a cloſe Veſſel: Beſides having kindled Amber, and held a clean Silver Spoon, or ſome other Concave and ſmooth Veſſel over the Smoak of its Flame; I obſervd the Soot into which that. Fume condens'd, to be very diffeting ſrom any thing that I had obſerv d to proceed from the ſteam of Amber purpoſely (for that is not uſual) diſtilled per ſe in cloſe Velſels. Thus having, for Tryals ſake, kindled Camphire, and catcht the Smoak that copiouſly alcended out of the Flame, it condensd into a Black and unctuous Soot, which would not have been gueſo d by the Smell or other Properties to have proceeded from Camphire: whereas having (as I ſhall otherwhere more fully declare) exposd a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete to a entle heat in a cloſe Glaſs- Veſſel, it Rſblim⸗ up without ſeeming to have loſt any thing of its whitencſs, or its Nature, both which it retain'd, though aſterwards Iſo encreaſed the Fire as to bring it to Fuſion. And, beſides Camphire, there are divers other Bodies (that I elſewhere name) in which the heat in cloſe Veſſels is not wont to make any ſeparation of Heterogeneities, but only a comminution of Parts, thoſe that riſe firſt being Homoge neal with the others, though ſubdivided into ſmaller Particles: whence Sublimations have been ſtiled, The Pestles of the Chymiſls. But not here to mention what I elſewhere take notice of, concerning common Brimſtone once or twice ſublimd, that exposd to a moderate Fire in Subliming- Pots, it riſes all into dry, and almoſt taſtleſs, Flowers3 Whereas being expos'd to a naked Fire it affords ſtore of a Saline and Fretting Liquor : Not to mention this, I ſay, Iwill further obſerve to you, that as it is conſiderable in the Analjſis of mixt Bodies, whether the Fire act on them when they are exposd to the open Air, or ſhut up in cloſe Veſſels, ſo is the degree of Fire by which the Analyſis is attempted of no ſmall moment. ſ a milde Balneum will ſever unfermented Blood (for Inſtance) but into Phlegme and Caput mortuum, the later whereof (which I have ſometimes had) hard, brittle, and of divers Colours, ( tranſparent almoſt like Tortoiſe- ſhell) preſ”ã by a good Fire in a Retort yields a Spirit, an Oyl or two, and a volatile Salt, beſides a Caput mortuum. It may be alſo pertinent to our preſent Deſigne, to take notice of what happens in the making and diſtilling of Sope; for by one degree of Fire the Salt, the Warer and the Oyl or Greaſe, whereof that factitious Concrete is made up, being boyld up together are eaſily brought to mingle and incorporate iuto one Maſs; but by another and further degree of Heat the ſame Maſs may be again divided into an oleagenous, an aqucous, a Saline, and an Earthy part. And ſo we may obſcrve that impure Silver and Lead being exposd together to a moderate Fire, will thereby be colliquated into one Maſs, and mingle per minima, as they ſpeak, whereas a much vehementer Fire will drive or carry off the baſer Metals (I mean the Lead, and the Copper or other Alloy) from the Silver, though not, for ought appears, ſeparate thm ſrom one another. Beſides, when a Veetable abounding in fixt Salt is analyæ'd y a naked Fire, as one degree of Heat vill reduce it into Aſhes, (as the Chymiſts themſelves teach us) ſo, byonly a further degree of Fire, thoſe Aſhes may be simibed and turnd into Glaſs. I will not ſtay to examine how far a meere Chymiſt might on this occaſion demand, If it be lawſul ſor an Ariſtorelian to make Aſhes, (which he miſtakes ſor meere Earth) paſs for an Element, becauſe by one degree of Fire it may be producd, why a Chymiſt may not upon the lixe Principle argue, that Glaſs is one of the Elements of many Bodies, becauſe that alſo may be obtaind from them, barely by the Fire? I will not, I ſay, Ioſe time to examine this, but obſerve, that by a Method of applying the Fire, ſuch ſimilar Bodies may be obtain'd from a Concrete, as Chymiſts have not been able to ſeparate; either by barely burning it in an open Fire, or by barely diſtilling it in cloſe Veſſels. For to me it ſcems very conſiderable, and I wonder that men have taken ſo little notice of it, that Ihave not by any of the common wayes of Diſtillation in cloſe Veſſels, ſeen any ſeparation made of ſuch a volatile Salt as is afforded us by Wood, when that is firſt by an open Fire divided into Aſhes and Soot, and that Soot is afterwards plac'd in a ſtrong Retort, and compell'd by an urgent Fire to part with its Spirit, Oyl and Salt; for thoughI dare not peremptorily deny, that in the Liquors of Guajacum and other Woods diſtil'd in Retorts aſter the common manner, there may be Saline parts, which by reaſon of the Analogy may pretend to the name of ſome kinde of volatile Salts; yet queſtionleſs there is a great diſparity berixt ſuch Salts and that which we have ſometimes obraind upon the firſt Diſtillation of Soot (though ſor the moſt part it has not been ſeparated from the firſt or ſecond Rectification, and ſometimes not till the third) For we could never yet ſee ſeparated from Woods analyzd only the vulgar way in cloſe veſſels any volatile Salt in a dry and Saline form, as that of Soot, which we have often had very Cryſtalline and Geometrically figurd. And then, whereas the Saline parts of the Spirits of Guajacum, &c. appear upon diſtillation ſluggiſh enough, the Salt of Soot ſeems to be one o? the moſt volatile Bodies in all Nature3 and iſ it be well made vill readily aſcend with the milde heat of a Furnace, warmd only by the ſingle Wieck of a Lamp, to the top of the higheſt Glaſs Veſſels that are commonly made uſe of for Diſtillation: and beſides all this, the taſte and ſmell of the Salt of Soot are exceeding differing from thoſe of the Spirits of Guajacum, &c. and the former not only ſmells and taſtes much leſs like a vegetable Salt, than like that of Harts- horn, and ohor Animal Concretes; but in d vers other Properties ſeems more of Kinne to the Family of Animals,than to that of vegetable Salts, as I may elſlewhere (God permitting) have an occaſion more particularly to declare. I might likewiſe by ſome other Examples manifeſt, That the Chymiſts, to have dealt clearly, ought to have more explicitly and particularly declard by what Degree of Fire, and in what manner of Application of it, they would have us Judge a Diviſion made by tho Fire to be a true Analjſis into their Principles, and the Productions of it to deſerve the name oſ Elementary Bodies. Bur it is time that I procecd to mention the particular Reaſons that incline me to Doubt, whether the Fire be the true and univerſal Analyzer of mixt Bodies; of which Reaſons what has been already objected may paſs for one. In the next place I obſerve, That there are ſome mixt Bodies from which it has not been yet made appear, that any degree of Fire can ſeparate cither Saſt or Sulphur or Mercury, much leſs all the Three. The moſt obvious Inſtance of this Truth is Gold, which is a Body ſo fixd, and wherein the Elementary Ingredients ũi it have any) are ſo firmly united to cach other, that we finde nut in the operations wherein Gold is expos'd to the Fire, how violent ſoever, that it does diſcernably ſo much as loſe of its fixedneſſe or weight, ſo far is it from being diſſipated into thoſe Principles, whereof one at leaſt is acknowledged to be Fugitive enough; and ſo juſtſy did the Spagyricall Poct ſomewhere exclaim, Cunſia adeo miris illic compagibus herent. And I muſt not omit on this occaſion to mention to you, Eleutheriu, the memorable Experiment that I remember I met with in  Gaſto Claveu, who, though a Lawyer by Profeſſion, ſecms to have E had no ſmaſl Curioſity and Experience in Chymical affairs: He relates then, that having put into one ſmall Earthen Veſſel an Ounce of the moſt pure Gold, and into another the like weight of pure Silver, he plac'd them both in that part of a Glaſs- houſe Furnace wherein the Workmen keep their Metal, (as our Engli Artificers call their Liquid Glaſs) contiaually melted, and that having there hept both the Gold and the Silver in conſtant Fuſion for two Moneths together, he afterwards took them out oſ the Furnace and the Veſſels, and weighing both of them again, found that the Silver had not loſt above a 12th part of its weight, but the Gold had not of his loſt any thing at all. And though our Author endeavours to give us of this a Scholaſtick Reaſon, which  ſuppoſe you would be as little ſatisſied with, as I was when Iread it; yet for the matter of Fact, which will ſerve our preſent turne, he aſſures us, that though it be ſtrange, yet Experience it ſelf taught it him to be moſt true. And though there be not perhapsany other Body to be found ſo perfectly fixd as Gold, yet there are divers others ſo fix'd or composd, at leaſt of ſo ſtrictly united parts, that I have not yet obſervd the Fire to ſeparate from them anv one of the Chymiſts Principles. I need not tell you what Complaints the more Candid and Judicious of the Chymiſts themſelves are wont to make ot thoſe Boaſters that confidently pretend, that they have extracted the Salt or Sulphur of Quickſilver, when they have diſpuis'd ſembles the Concretes whoſe Names are given it 3 whereas by a skilfull and rigid Ex amen, it may be eaſly enough ſtript of its Diſguiſes, and made to appear again in the priſtine ſorm oſ running Mercury. The pretended Salts and Sulphurs being ſo far from being Elementary parts extracted out of the Bodic o Mercurie, that they are rather (to borrow a terme of the Grammarians) De- compound Bodies, made up of the whole Metal and the Monsiruan or other Additaments imployd to diſguiſe it. And as for Silver, I never could ſee any degree of Fire make it part with any of its three Principles. And though the Experiment lately mentioned from Claveus may beget a Suſpition that Silver may be diſſipated by Fire, provided it be extreamly violent and very laſting: yet it will not neceſſarily follow, that becauſe the Fire was able at length to make the Silver loſe a little of its weight, it was thereſore able to diſſipate itinto its Principles. For ſirſt I might alledge that I have obſervd little Grains of Silver to lie hid in the ſmall Cavities (perhaps glas'd over by a viriſying heat) in Crucibles, wherein Silver has been long kept in Fuſion, whence ſome Goldſmiths of my Acquaintance make a Benefit by grinding ſuch Crucibles to powder, to recover out of them the latent particles of Silver. And hence I might argue, that perhaps Claveus was miſtaken, and imagind that Silver to have been driven avay by the Fire, that indecd lay in minute parts hid in his Crucible, in whoſe pores ſo ſmall a quantity as he miſt of ſo ponderous a Bodie might very well lie conccald. But Secondly, admirting that ſome parts of the Silver were driven away by the violence of the Fire, what proof is there that it was cither the Salt, the Sulphur, or the Mercury of the Metal, and not rather a part of it homogeneous to what remaind? For beſides, that theSilver that was leſt ſeem d not ſenſibly alter'd, which probably would have appear'd, had ſo much of any one of its Principles been ſeparated from it: We finde in other Mineral Bodies of a leſs permanent nature than Silver, that the Fire may divide them into ſuch minute parts, as to be able to carry them away with its ſelf, without at all deſtroying their fining of Silver, the Lead that is mixd with it (to carry away the Copper or other ignoble Mineral that embaſes the Silver) will, if it be let alone, in time evaporate away upon the Teſt; but if Cas is moſt uſual amongſt thoſe that refine Jreas quantities of Metals together) the Lead be blown off from the Silver by Bellowes, that which would elſe have gone away in the Form of unheeded ſteams, will in great part be collected not far from the Silver, in the Form of a darkiſh Powder or Calx, which, becauſe it is blown off from Silver, they call Litharge of Silver. And thus A4ricola in divers places informs us, when Copper, or the Oare of it is colliquated by the violence of the Fire with Caãnia, the Sparks that in great multitudes do fly upwaras do, ſome of them, ſtick to the vaulted Rooſs of the Furnaces, in the form of little and (for the moſt part) Wiite Bubbles, which therefore the Greeks, and, in Imitation of them, our Drugſters call Pompholix : and others more heavy partly adhere to the ſides of the Furnace, and partly (eſpecially if the Covers be not kept upon the Pots)fallto the Ground, and by reaſon of their Aſby Colour as well as Weight were called by the ſame Greeks æ, which, I need not tell you, in their Language ſignifies Aſhes. I might add, that I have not found that from Venetian Talck (Iſay Venetian, becauſe I have found other kinds of that Mineral more open) from the Lapis Oſſifragus, (which the Shops call oꝶiocolla) ſrom Muſcovia Glaſs, from pure and Fuſible Sand, to mention now no other Concretes; thoſe of my Acquaintance that have try'd have been ãble by the Fire to ſeparate any one of the Hypoſtatical Principles, which you will the leſs ſcruple to believe, if you conſider that Glaſs may be made by the bare Colliquation ol the Salt and Earth remaining In the Aſhes of a burnt Plant, and that yet common Glaſs, once made, does ſo far ręſiſt the violence of the Fire, that moſt Chymiſis think it a Body more undeſtroyable then Gold it ſell. For if the Artificer can ſo firmly unite ſuch comparative groſs Particles às thoſe of Earth and Salt that make up common Aſhes, into a Body indiſſoluble by Fire; why may not Nature aſſociate in divers Bodies the more minute Elementary Corpuſcles ſhe has at hand too firmly to let them be ſeparable by the Fire ? And on this Oalion, Eleutheriu, give me ]eave to mention to you two or three ſleight Experiments, which will, Ihope, be found more pertinent to our preſent Diſcourſe, than at firſt perhaps they will appear. The firſt is, that, having (for Tryals lake) put a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete, Camphire, into a Glaſs Veſſel, and placd it in a gentle Heat, I found it (not leaving behinde, according to my Eſtimate, not ſo much as one Grain) to ſublime to the Top of the Veſſel into Flowers: which in Whiteneſs, Smell, 8c. ſcemd not to differ from the Camphire it ſelf. Another Experiment is that oſ Helmont, who in ſeveral places aſfirms, That a Coal kept in a Glaſs exactly clos d will never be calcin d to Aſhes, though kept never ſo long in a ſtrong Fire. To countenance which I ſhall tell you this Tryal of my own, That having ſometimes diſtilled ſome Woods, as particularly Box, whilſt our Caput mortuum remaind in the Retort, it continued black like Charcoal, though the Retort were Earthen, and kept redhot in a vehement Fire; but as ſoon as ever it was brought out of the candent Veſſel into the open Air, the burning Coals did haſtily degenerate or fall aſunder, without the Aſſiſtance of any new Calcination, into pure white Aſhes. And to theſe two I ſnall add but this obvious and known Obſervation, that common Sulphur ſif it be pure and freed trom its Vinager) being leaſurely ſublimd in cloſe Veſſels, riſes into dry Flowers, which may be preſently melted into a Bodie of the ſame Nature with that which afforded them. Though if Brimſtone be burnt in the open Air it gives, you know, a penetrating Fume, which being caught in a Glaſs- Bell condenſes into that acid Liquor called Oyl of Sulphur per Campanam. The uſe I would make of theſc Experiments collated with what Ilately told you out of Agricola is this, That even among the Bodies that are not fixt, there are divers of ſuch a Texture, that it will be hard to make it appcar, how the Fire, as Chymiſts are wont to imploy it, can reſolve them into Elementary Subſtances. For ſome Bodies being of ſuch a Texture that the Fire can drive them into the cooler and leſs hot part of the Veſſels wherein thev are included, and if need be, remove them from place to place to fly the greateſt heat, more ealily than ĩt can divorce their Elements (eſpecially without the Aſſiſtance of the Air) we ſee that our Chymiſts cannot Analyze them in cloſe Veſſels, and of other compound Bodies the open Fire can as little ſeparate the Elements. For what can a naked Fire do to Analyze a mixt Bodie, if its component Principles be ſo minute, and ſo ſtrictly united, that the Corpuſcles of it need leſs heat to carry them up, than is requiſite to divide them into their Principſes. So that of ſome Bodies the Fire cannot in cloſe Veſſels make any Analyſis at all, and others will in the open Air fly away in the Forms of Flowers or Iiquors, before the Heat can prove able to divide them into their Principles. And this may hold, whether the various ſimilar parts of a Concrete be combin'd by Nature or by Art; For in factitious Sal Armoniack we finde the common and the Urinous Salts ſo well mingled, that both in the open Fire, and in ſubliming Veſſels they riſe together as one Salt, which ſeems in ſuch Veſſels irreſoluble by Fire alone. For I can ſhew you Sal Armoniack which after the ninth Sublimation does ſtill retain its compounded Nature. And indeed ſcarcc know any one Mineral, from which by Fire alone Chymiſts are wont to ſever any Subſtance ſimple enough to deſcrve the name of an Element or Principle. For though out of native Cinnaber they diſtill Quicſilver, and though from many of thoſe Stones that the Ancients called Pyrites they ſublime Brimſtone, yet both that Quiſilver and this Sulphur being very otten the ſame with the common Minerals that are ſold in the Shops under thoſe names, ate themſelves too much compounded Bodies to paſs for the Elements of ſuch. And thus much, Eleutherius, for the Second Argument that belongs to my Firſt Conſideration; the others I ſhall the leſſe inſiſt on, becauſc I have dwelt fo long upon this. Proceed we then in the next place to conſider, That there are divers Separations to be made by other means, which cither cannot at all, or elſe cannot ſo well be made by the Fire alone. When Gold and Silver are melted into one Maſs, it would lay a great Obligation upon Reſiners and Goldſmiths to teach them the Art of ſeparating them by the Fire, without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to ſever them. Whereas they may be very caſily parted by the Affuſion ot Spirit of Nitre or Aqua fortis (which the French therefore call Eau de Depart:) ſo likeviſe the Metalline part of Vitriol will not be ſo eaſily and conveniently ſeparated from the Saline part even by a violent Fire, as by the Affuſion of certain Alkalizate Salts in a liquid Form upon the Solution of Vitriol made in common water. For thereby the acid Salt of the Vitriol, leaving the Copper it had corroded to joyn with the added Salts, the Metalline part will be precipitated to the bottom almoſt like Mud. And that I may not give Inſtances only in De- compeund Bodies, Iwill add a not uſeleſs one of another kinde, Not only Chymiſts have not been able (for ought is vulgarly known) by Fire alone to ſeparate true Sulphur from Antimony; but though you may finde in their Books many plauſible Proceſſes of Extracting it, ver he that ſhall make as many fruitleſſe Tryals as I have done to obrain it by, moſt of them will, Iſuppoſe, be caſily perſwaded, that the Productions of ſuch Proceſſes are Antimonial Sulphurs rather in Name than Nature. But though Antimony ſublimd by its ſelf is reducd bur to a volatile Powder, or Antimonial Flowers, of a compounded Nature like the Mineral that affords them: yet I remember that ſome years ago I ſublimd out of Antimony a Sulphur, and that in greater plenty then ever Iſaw obtain'd from that Mineral, by a Method which I ſnall therefore acquaint you with, becauſe Chymiſts ſcem not to have taken notice of what Importance ſuch Experiments may be in the Indagation of the Nature, and eſpecially of the Number of the Elements. Having then purpoſely for Tryals ſake digeſted eight Ounces of good and well powderd Antimony with twelve Ounces of Oyl of Vitriol in a well ſtopt Glas-Veſſel for abour ſix or ſcven Weeks3 and having caus'd the Maſs (grown hard and brittle) to be diſtill'd in a Retort placd in Sand, with a ſtrong Fire3 we found the Antimony to be ſo opened, or alter'd by the enſtruum wherewith it had been digeſted, That whereas crude Antimony, ford up by the Fire, ariſes only in Flowers, our Antimony thus handled afforded us partly in. the Receiver, and partly in the Neck and at the Top of the Retort, about an Ounce of Sulphur, yellow and brittle like common Brimſtone, and of ſo Sulphureous a ſmell, that upon the unluting the Veſſels it infected the Room with a ſcarce ſupportable ſtink. And this Sulphur, beſides the Colour and Smell, had the perfect Inflamability of common Brimſtone, and would immediately kindle (at the Flame of a Candle) and burn ble like it. And though iſt ſeemd that the long digeſtion whereIn our Antimony and Menſtruum were detain'd, did conduce to the better unlocking of the Mincral, yet if you have not the leaſure to make ſo long a Digeſtion, you may by incorporating with powder'd Antimony a convenient Quantity of Oyl ol Vitriol, and committing them immediately to Diſtillation, obtain a Iittle Sulphur like unto the common one, and more combuſtible than perhaps you will at firſt take notice of, For I have obſerv'd, that though (aſter its being firſt kindled) the Flame would ſometimes go out too ſoon of its ſelf, if the ſame Lump of Sulphur were held again to the Flame of a Candle, it would be rekindled and burn a pretty while, not only aſter the ſecond, but after the third or fourth accenſion. You, to whom I think I ſhewed my way of diſcovering ſomething of Sulphureous in Oylof Vitriol, may perchance ſuſpect, Eleutherius, either that this Subſtance was ſome Venereal Sulphur that lay hid in that Liquor, and was by this operation only reduc'd into a manifeſt Body; or elſe that it was a compound of the unctuous parts of the Antimony, and the Saline ones of the Vitriol, in regard that (as Gusther informs us) divers learned men would have Sulphur to be nothing but a mixture made in the Bowels of the Earth of Vitriolate Spirits and a certain combuſtible Subſtance. But the Quantity of Sulphur we obtaid by Digeſtion was much too great to have been latent in the Oyl of Vitriol. And that Vitriolate Spirits are not neceſſary to the Conſtitution of ſuch a Sulphur as ours, I could ealily manifeſt, if I would acquaint you with the ſeveral wayes b which Ihave obtaind, though not in uch plenty, a Sulphur of Antimony, colour'd and combuſtible like common Brimſtone. And though Iam not now minded to diſcover them, yet I ſhall tell you, that to ſatisfic ſome Ingenious Men, that diltill'd Vitriolate Spirits are not neceſſary to the obtaining of ſuch a Sulphur as we have been conſidering, I did by the bare diſtillation of only Spirit of Nitre, from its weight of crude Antimony ſeparate, in a ſhort time, a yellow and very inflamable Sulphur, which, for ought I know, deſerves as much the name of an Element, as any thing that Chymiſts are wont to ſeparate from any Mineral by the Fire. I could perhaps tell you of other Operations upon Antimony, whereby That may be extracted from it, which cannot be fordd out of it by the Fire3 but I ſhall reſerve them for a fitter Opportunity, and only annex at preſent this ſleight, but not impertinent Experiment. That whereas I lately obſerved to you, that the Urinous and common Salts whereof Sal Armoniack conſiſts,remaind unſeverd by the Fire in many ſucceſſive Sublimations, they may be eaſily ſeparated, and partly without anyFire at all, by pouring upon the Concrete finely powderd, a Solution of Salt of Tartar, or of the Salt of WoodAſhes; for upon your diligently mixing of theſe you will ſinde your Noſe invaded with a very ſtrong ſmell of Urine, and perhaps too your Eyes ſorc'd to water, by the ſame ſubtle and piercing Body that produces the ſtink; both theſe etfects proceeding from hence, that by the Alcalizate Salt, the Sea Salt that enter'd the compoſition of the Sal Armoniack is mortiſyd and made more fixt,and thereby a divorce is made between it and the volatile Urinous Salte, which being at once ſet at liberty, and put into motion, begins preſently to fly avay, and to ofſend the Noſtrils and Eyes it meets witli by the way. And if the operation of theſe Salts be in convenient Glaſſes promoted by warmth, though but by that of a Bath, the aſcending Steams may caſily be caught and reduc'd into a penetrant Spirit, Bbounding with a Salt, which I have ſometimes found to be ſeparable in a Cryſtalline Form. I might add to theſe Inſtances, that whereas Sublimate, conſiſting, as you know, of Salts & Quickſilver combind and carried up together by Heat, may be Sublimd, Iknow not how often, by a like degree of Fire, without ſuffering any divorce of the component Bodies, the Mercury may be ea4 ſily ſeverd ſrom the adhering Salts, if the Sublimate be diſtil'd from Salt of Tartar, Quick Lime, or ſuch Alcalizate Bodies. but I will rather obſerve to you, Eleutherim, what divers ingenious men have thought ſomewhat ſtrange; that by ſuch an Additament that ſeems but only to promote the Separation, there may be eaſily obtain'd ſrom a Concrete that byihe Fire alone ĩs eaſily diviſible into all the Elements that Vegetables are ſupposd to conſiſt of, ch a ſimilat Subſtance as differs in many reſpects from them all, and conſequently has by many of the moſt Intelligent Chymiſts been denied to be containd in the mixt Body. For I know a way, and have practisd it, whercby common Tartar, without the addition of any thing that is not perſectly a Mineral except Saltpetre, may by one Diſtillation in an Earthen Retort be made to afford good ſtore of real Salt, readily diſſoluble in water, which I found to be neither acid, nor of the ſmell of Tartar, and to be almoſt as volatile as Spiri of Wine it ſelf, and to be indecd of ſo differing a Nature from all that is wont to be ſeparated by Fire ſrom Tartar, that divers Learned Men, with whom I diſcoursd of it, could hardly be brought to beleeve, that ſo fugitive a Salt could be afforded by Tartar, tillI aſſurd it them upon my own Knowledge. And if I did not think you apt to ſuſpect me to be rather too backward than too forward to credit or affirm unlikely things, Icould convince you by what I have yet lying by me of that anomalous Salt. The Fourth thing that I ſhall alledge to countenance my firſt Conſideration is, That the Fire even when it divides a Body into Subſtances of divers Conſiſtences, does not moſt commonly analyze it into Hypoſtatical Principles, but only diſpoſes its parts into new Textures, and thereby produces Concretes ofa new indeed, but yet of a compound Naure. This Argument it will be requiſite for me to proſccute ſo fully hereaſter, that I hope you will then confeſs that tis not for want of good Prooſs that I deſire leave to ſuſpend my Prooſs till the Series of my Diſcourſe ſhall make it more proper and ſcaſonable to propoſe them. It may be ſurther alledęd on the behalf of my Firſt Conſideration, That taind ſrom ſome Concretes without Fire, as deſerve no leſs the name of Elementary, than many that Chymiſls extort by the Violence of the Fire. We ſee that the Inflamable Spirit, or as the Chymiſts eſteem it, the Sulphur of Wine, may not only be ſeparated ſrom it by the gentle heat of a Bath, but may be diſtild either by the help of the Sun-Beams, or even of a Dunghill, being indeed of ſo Fugitive a Nature, that it is not eaſy to keep it from flying aay, even without the Application of external heat. I have likewiſe obſerv'd that a Veſſel full of Urine being placd in a Dunghill, the Putrefaction is wont aſter ſome wecks ſo to open the Body, that the parts disbanding the Saline Spirit, will within no very long time, iſf the Veſſel be not ſtopt, fly away of it ſelf; Inſomuch that from ſuch Urine I have been able to diſtill little or nothing elſe than a nauſeous Phlegme, inſtead of the active and piercing Salt and Spirit that it would have afforded, when fitſt exposd to the Fire, if the Veſſel had been carefully ſtopt. Andthis leads me to conſider in the Fiſth place, That it will be very hard to prove, that there can no other Body or way be given which will as well as the Fire divide Concretes into ſeveral homogeneous Subitances, which may conlequently be calld their Elements or Principles, as well as thoſe ſeparated or producd by the Fire. For ſince we have lately ſeen, that Nature can ſucceſſeſully employ other Inſtruments than the Fire to ſeparate diſtinct Subſtances ſrom mixt Bodies, how know we, but that Nature has made, or Art may make, ſome ſuch Subſtance as may be à fit Inſtrument to alyze mixt Bodies, or that ſome ſuch Method may be found by Humane Induſtry or Luck, by whoſe means compound Bodies may be reſolvd into other Subſtances, than ſuch as theyare wont to be divided into by the Fire. And why the Products of ſuch an Aualyſis may not as juſtly be calld the component Principles of the Bodies that afford them, it will not be eaſy to ſnew, eſpecially ſince I ſhall hereaſter make it evidenr, that the Subſtances which Chymiſts are wont to call the Salts, and Sulphurs, and Mercuries of Bodies, are not ſo pure and Elementaty as they preſume, and as their Hypotheſis requires. And this may therefore be the more ſreely preſs'd upon the Chymiſts, becauſe neither the Paracelſians, nor the Helmontians can reject it without apparent Injury to their reſpective Maſters. For Helmont do's more than oncę Inform his Readers, that both Paracelſus and Himſelf were Poſſeſſors of the famous Liquor, Altabest, which for ĩts great power in reſolving Bodies irreſoluble by Vulgar Fires, he ſomewhere ſeems to call Ignis Gebennæ. To this Liquor he aſcribes, (and that in reat part upon his own Experience) hch wonders, that if we ſuppoſe them all true, I am ſo much the more a Friend 10 Knowledge than to Wealth, that I ſhould think the Alkahest a nobler and more deſireable Secret than the Philoſophers Stone it ſelf. OF this Univerſal Diſſolvent he relates, That having digeſted with it for a competent time a piece of Oaken Charcoal, it was thereby reduc'd into a couple of new and diſtinct Liquors, diſcriminated from each other by their Colour and Situation, and that the whole body of the Coal was reduc'd into thoſe Liquors, both of them ſeparable from his Immortal Menſtruum, ons as before. And he moreover tells us in divers places oſ his Writings, that by this powerful, and unwearied Agent, he could diſſolve Metals, Marchaſites, Stones, Vegetable and Animal Bodies of what kinde ſoever, and even Glaſs ĩt ſelf (firſt reduc'd to powder,) and in a word, all kinds of mixt Bodies in the World into their ſeveral ſimilar Subſtances, without any Reſidence or Cã.t mortuum, And laſtly, e may gather this ſurther from his Informations, That the homogeneous Subſtances obtainable from compound Bodies by his piercing Liquor, were oftentimes different enough both as to Number and as to Nature, from thoſe into which the ſame Bodies are wont to be divided by common Fire. Of which I ſhall need in this place to mention no other proof, then that whereas we know that in cur common Araliſis of a mixt Body, there remains a ereſtiial and very ſixt Subſtance, oftentimes aſſociated. with a salt as fixt; Our Author tells us, that by his wav he could Diſtill over all Concretes without any Cæu: mortuam, and conſequently could make thoſe parts of the Concrete volatile, which in the Vulgar Analjſis wonld ave been fixt. So that if our Chymiſts will not reject the ſolemn and repeated Teſtimony ofa Perſon, who cannot but be acknowledęgd for one of the greateſt Spagyriſts that they can boaſt of, they muſt not deny that there is to be found in Nature another Agent able to Analyze compound Bodies leſs violently, and both more genuinely and more univerſally than the Fire. And for my own part, though I cannot but ſay on this Occaſion what (you know) our Friend Mr. Boyle is wont to ſay, when he is askt his Opinion of any ſtrange Experiment; That He that hath ſeen it batl more Reaſon to beleeve it, than He that hath rot; yerl have found Helmont ſo faithſul a Writer, even in divers of his improbable Experiments (I alwayes except thatExtravagant Treatiſe DeMagnetica Vulnerum Curatione, which ſome of his Friends affirm to have been firſt publiſn'd by his Enemies) that Ithink it ſomewhat harſh to give him the Lye, eſpecially to what he delivers upon his own proper Tryal. And I have heard from very credible Eyewitneſſes ſome things, and ſeen ſome others my ſelf, which argue ſo ſtrongly, that a circulated Salt, or a Menftruum (ſuch as it maybe) may by being abſtracted ſrom compound Bodies, whether Mineral, Animal, or Vegetable, leave them more unlockt than a wary Naturaliſt would eaſily beleeve, that I dare not confidently meaſure the Power of Nature and Art by that of the enstruums, and other Inſtruments that eminent Chymiſts themſelves are as yet wont to Empoly about the Analyzing of Bodies3 nor Deny that a Menſtruum may at leaſt from this or that particular Concrete obtain ſome apparently ſimilar Subſtance, differing from any obtainable from the ſame Body by any degree or manner of Application of the Fire. And Iam the more backward to deny peremptorily, that there may be ſuch Openers of compound Bodies, becauſe among the Experiments that make me ſpeak thus warily, there wanted not ſome in which it appeard nor, that one of the Subſtances not ſeparable by common Fires and Menſtruums could retain any thing of the Salt by which the ſeparation was made. And here, Eleutheris, (ſayes Carneades) I ſhould conclude as much of my ſideration I proposd, but that I ſoreſee, that what I have delivered will appear liable to two ſuch ſpecious Objections, that Icannot ſafely proceed any further till I have examind them. And fſirſt, one ſort of Oppoſers will be forward to tell me, That they do not pretend by Fire alone to ſeparate out of all compound Bodies theit Hypostatical Principles; it being ſufficient that the Fire dividẽs them into ſuch, though aſterwards they employ other Bodies to collect the ſimilar parts of the Compound; astis known, that though they make uſe of water to collect the Saline parts of Aſhes from the Terreltrial wherewith they are blended, yet it is the Fire only that Incinerates Bodies, and reduces the fix'd part of them into the Salt and Earth, whereoſ Aſhes are made up. This Objection is not, Iconſeſs, inconſiderable, and I might in great part allow of it, without granting it to make againſt me, if I void content my ſelf to anſwer, that it is not againſt thoſc that make it that I have been diſputing, but againſt thoſe Vulgar Chymiſts, who themſclves believe, and would fain make others do ſo, That the Fire is not only an univerſal, but an adæquate and ſſficient Inſtrument to analyZe mixt Bodies with. For as to their Practice of Extracting the fixXd Salt out of Aſhes by the Affuſion of Warer,tis obvious to alleadge, that the Water does only aſſemble together the Salt the Fire had before divided ſrom the Earth : as a Sieve does not further break the Corn, bur oniy bring together into two diſtinct heaps the Flour and the Bran; whoſe Corpuſcles before lay promiſcuouſly blended together in the Meal. This Iſay I might alleadge, and thercby exempr my ſelf ſrom the need of taking any farther notice of the proposd Objection. But not to loſe the Riſe it may afford me of Illuſtrating the matter under Conſideration, I am content briefly to conſider it, as far forth as my preſent Diſquiſition may be concernd in it. Not to repeat then what has been already anſwerq, I ſay farther, that though Iam ſo civil an Adverſary, that I will allow the Chymiſts, after the Fire has done all its work, the uſe of fair Water to make their Extractions with, in ſuch caſes wherein the Water does not cooperate with the Fire to make the AnaG liſis;yet ſince I Grant this but upon Suppoſition that the Water does only waſh off the Saline Particles, which the Fire Alonc has Before Extricated in the Analyz'd Body, it will not be Reaſonable, that this Conceſſion ſhould Extend to other Liquors that may Add to what they Diſſolve, nor ſo much as to other Caſes than thoſe Newly Mentioned: Wrhich Limitation I Delire You would be Pleas’d to Bear in Mind till I ſhall Anon have Occaſion to make Uſe of it. And This being thus Premis'd, I ſhall Procced to Obſerve, Firſt, That Many of the Inſtances I Proposd in the Preceding Diſcourſe are Such, that the Objection we are Conſidering will not at all Reach Them. For Fire can no more with the Aſſiſtance of Water than without it Separate any of the Three Principles, cither from Gold, Silver, Mercury, or ſome Others of the Concretes named Above. Hence We may Inferre, That Fire is not an Univerſal Analyzer of all Mixt Bodies, ſince of Metals and Minerals, wherein Chymiſts have moſt Exercis'd Themſelves, there Appear ſcarce Any which they are able to Aanlyze by Fire, Nay, from which they can Unqueſtionably Separate ſo much as any One of their Hypoſtatical Principles; Which may well Appear no ſmall Diſparagement as well to their Hypotheſis as to their Pretenſions. It will alſo remain True, notwithſtanding the Objection, That there may be Other Wayes than the wonted Analyſis by Fire, to Separate from a Compound Body Subſtances as Homogeneneous as thoſe that Chymiſts Scruple not to Reckon among their Tria Prima ( as ſome of them, for Brevity Sake, call their Three Principles.) And it Appears, That by Convenient Additaments ſuch Subſtances may be Separated by the Help of the Fire, as could not be ſo by the Fire alone: Witneſs the Sulphur of Antimony. And Laſtly, I muſt Repreſent, That ſince it appears too that the Fire is but One of the Inſtruments that muſt be Employd in the Reſolution of Bodies, We may Reaſonably Challenge the Liberty of doing Two Things. For when ever any Menstruum or other Additament is Employd, together with the Fire to Obtaina Sulphur or a Salt ſrom a Body, We may well take the Freedom to Examine, whether or no That Merſtruam do barcly Help to Separate the Principle Obtain d by It, or whether there Intervene not a Coalition of the Parts of the Body Wrought upon with Thoſe of the Menſlruum, whereby the Produc d Concrete may be Judgd to Reſult from the Union of Both. And it will be farther Allowable for Us to Conſider, how far any Subſtance, Separated by the Help of ſuch Additaments, Ought to paſs for one of the Tria Prima; ſince by Onc Way of Handling the ſame Mixt Body it may according to the Nature of the Additaments, and the Method of Working upon it, be made to Afford differing Subſtances from thoſe Obtainable from it by other Additaments, and another Method, nay and (as may appear by what I Formerly told You about Tartar) Differing from any of the Subſtances into which a Concrete is Diviſible by the Fire without Additaments, though perhaps thoſe Additaments do not, as Ingredients, enter the Compoſition of the Obtained Bodyv, but only Diverſify the Operation of the Fire upon the Concrete; and though nat Concrete by the Fire alone may be Divided into a Number of Differing Subſtances, as Great as any oſ the Chymiſts that l have met with teach us that of the Elements to be. And having ſaid thus much (ſayes Carneades) to the Objection likely to be Proposd by ſome Chymiſts, I am now to Examine that which I Foreſece will be Confidently preſsd by Divers Peripateticks, who, to Prove Fire to be the true Analyzer of Bodies, will Plead, That it is the very Definition of Heat given by Ariſtuile, and Generally Received, Congregare Homogenea, & Heterogenea Segregare, to Aſſemble Things of a Reſcmbling, and Disjoyn thoſe of a Differing Nature. To this I anſwer, That this Effect is far from being ſo Eſſential to Heat, astis Generally Imagind ; for it rather Seems, that the True and Genuine Property of Heat is, to ſet a Moving, and thereby to Diſſociate the parts of Bodies, and Subdivide them into Minute Particles, without regard to their being Homogeneous or Heterogeneous, as is apparent in the Boyling of Water, the Diſtillation of Quickſilver, or the Expoſing of Bodies to the action of the Fire, whoſe Parts elther Are not (at leaſt in that Deęree of Heat Appear not) Diſſimilar, where all that the Fire can do, ĩs to Divide the Body into very Minute Parts which are of the ſame Nature with one another, and with their Totum, as their Reduction by Condenſation Evinces. And even when the Fire ſeems moſt ſo Congregare Homogenea, & Segregare Heterogenea, it Produces that Effect but by Accident; For the Fire does but Diſſolve the Cement, or rather Shatter the Frame, or Ltructure that kept the Heterogeneous Parts of Bodies together, under one Common Form; upon which Diſſolution the Component Particles ol the Mixt, being Freed and ſet at Liberty, do Nauraſly, and oftentimes without any Operation of the Fire, Aſſociate themſelves each with its Like, or rather do take thoſe places which their Scveral Degrees of Gravity and Levity, Fixedneſs or Volatility (either Naturãl, or Adventitious from the Impreſſion of the Fire) Aſſigne them. Thus in the Diſtillation (for Inſtance) of Mans Blood, the Fire dos Firſt begin to Diſſolve the Nexiu or Cement of the Body; and then the Water, being the moſt Volatile, and Eaſy to be Extracted, is either by the Igneous Atomes, or the Agitation they are put into by the Fire, firſt carried up, till Forſaken by what carried it up, its Weight ſinks it down into the Receiver: but all this while the other Principles of the Concrete Remain Unſever'd, and Require a ſtronger Degree of Heat to make a Separation of its more Fixt Elements3 and therefore the Fire muſt be Increas'd which Carries over the Volatile Salt and the Spirit, they being, though Beleevd to be Differing Principles, and though Really of Different Conſiſtency, yet of an almoſt Equal Volatility. After them, as leſs Fugitive, comes over the Oyl, and leaves behinde the Earth and the Aleali, which being of an Equal Fixedneſſe, the Fire Severs them not, for all the Definition of the Schools. And if into a Red-hot Earthen or Iron Retort you caſt the Matter to be Diſtill'd, You may Obſerve, as I have oſten done, that the Predominant Fire will Carry up all the Volatile Elements Conſuſedly in one Fume, which will aſterwards take their Places in the Receiver, either according to the Degree of their Gravity, or acG cording to the Exigency of their reſpective Texiures; the Salt Adhering, for the moſt part, to the Sides and Top, and the Phlegme Faſtening it ſelf there too in great Drops, the Oyle and Spirit placing themſelves Under, or Above one another, according as their Ponderouſneſs makes them Swim or Sink. For 'tis Obſervable, that though Oyl or Liquid Sulphur be one of the Elements Separated by this Fiery Analyſis, yet the Heat which Accidentally Unites the Particles of the other Volatile Principles, has not alwayes the ſame Operation on this, there being divers Bodies which Yield Two Oyls, whereof the One ſinks to the Bottom of that Spirit on which the other Swims; as I can ſhew You in ſome Oyls oſ the ſame Deers Blood, which are yet by Me: Nay Ican ſhiew you Two Oyls carefully made of the ſame Parcel of Humane Blood, which not only Differ extreamly in Colour, but SWim upon one another without Mixture, and if by Agitation Confounded ill of themſeſves Divorce again. And that the Fire doth oftentimes divide Bodies, upon the account that ſome of their Parts are more Fixt, and ſome more Volatile, how far ſoever either of theſe Two may be from a pure Elementary Nature is Obvious enough, if Men would but heed it in the Burming of Wood, which the Fire Difſipates into Smoake and Aſhes: For not only the latter of theſe is Confeſſedly made u of two ſuch Differing Bodies as Eart and Salt3 but the Former being condensd into that Soot which adheres to our Chimneys, Diſcovers it ſelf to Contain both Salt and Oyl, and Spirit and Earth, (and ſome Portion of Phlegme too) which being, all almoſt, Equally Volatile to that Degree of Fire which Forces them up, (the more Volatile Parts Helping perhaps, as well as the Urgency of the Fire, to carry up the more Fixt ones, as I have often Tryd in Dulcifyd Colcothar, Sublimd by Sal Armoriack Blended with it) are carried Up together, but may alterwards be Separated by other Degrees of Fire, whoſe orderly Gradation allowes the Diſparity of their Volatileneſs to Diſcover it ſelf. Beſides, if Differing Bodies United into one Maſi be both ſufficiently Fixt, the Fire finding no Parts Volatile enough to be Expell'd or carried up, makes no Separation at all; as may appear by a Mixture of Colliquated Silver and Gold, whoſe Component Metals may be eaſily Sever'd by Aqua Fortis, or Aqua Regis (according to the Predominancy of the Silver or the Gold) but in the Fire alone, though vehement, the Metals remain unſever'd, the Fire only dividing the Body into ſmaller Particles (whoſe Littleneſſec may be arg'd ſrom their Fluidity) in which cither the little nimble Atoms of Fire, or its brisk and numberleſs ſtrokes upon the Veſſels, hinder Reſt and Continuity, without any Sequeſtration of Elementary Principles. Moreover, the Fire ſometimes does not Separate, ſo much as Unite, Bodies of a differing Nature; provided they be of an almoſt reſembling Fixedneſs, and have in the Figure of their Parts an Aptneſs to Coalition, as we ſee in the making of many Plaiſters, Oyntments, &c. And in ſuch Metalline Mixtures as that made by Melting together two parts of clean Braſs with one of pure Copper, of which ſome Ingenious Trades-men caſt ſuch curious Patterns (for Gold and Silver Works) as I have ſometimes taken great Pleaſure to Look upon. Sometimes the Bodies mingled by the Fire are Differing enough as to Fixidity and Volatility, and yet are ſo combind by the firſt Operation of the Fire, that it Telf does ſcarce atterwards Separate them, but only Pulverize them; whereof an Inſtance is afforded us by the Common Preparation of Mercurims Dulcis, where the Saline Particles of the Vitriol, Sca Salt, and ſometimes Nirre, Employd to make tſie Sublimate, do ſo unite themſelves with the Mercurial Particles made uſe of, firſt to Make Sublimate, and then to Dulcifie it, that the Saline and Metalline Parts ariſe together in many ſucceſſive Sublimations, as if they all made but one Body. And ſometimes too the Fire does not only not Sever the Differing Elements of a Body, but Combine them ſo firmly, that Nature her ſelf does verv ſeldom, if ever, make Unions leſs Diſſoluble. For the Fire meeting with ſome Bodies excecdingly and almoſt equally Fixt, inſtcad of making a Separation, makes an Union ſo ſtrict, that it ſelf, alone, is unable to lizate Salt and the Terreſtrial Reſidue of the Aſhes are Incorporated with pure Sand, and by Vitrification made one permanent Body, (I mean the courſe or greeniſh ſort of Glaſs) that mocks the greateſt Violence of the Fire, which though able to Marry the Ingredients of it, yet is not able to Divorce them. I can ſhew you ſome pieces of Glaſs which I ſaw flow down from an Earthen Crucible purpoſely Exposd for a good while, with Silver in it, toa very vehement Fire. And ſome that deal much in the Fuſion of Metals Inſorme me, that the melting of a great part of a Crucible into Glaſs is no great Wonder in their Furnaces. I remember, Ihave Obſerv'd too in the Melting of great Quantities of Iron out of the Oar, by the Help of ſtore of Charcoal (for they Aſſirm that Sea- Coal will not yield a Flame ſtrong enough) that by the prodigious Vehemence of the Fire, Excited by vaſt Bellows (made to play by great Wrheels turmd about by Water) part of the Materials Exposd to it was, inſtead of being Analvæd, Colliquated, and turnd into a Dark, Solid and very tity, that in ſome places I have ſeen the very High wayes neer ſuch Iron-works, mended with Heaps of ſuch Lumps of Glaſſe, inſtead of Stones and Gravel. And I have alſo Obſerv'd, that ſome kind of Fire-ſtone it Self, having been employd in Furnaces whereiri it was exposd to very ſirong and laſting Fires, has had all its Fixt Parts ſo Wroughton by the Fire, as to be Perfectly Vitrifid, which Ihave tryd by Forcing from it Pretty large Pieces of Perfect and Tranſparent Glaſs. And leſt You might think, Eleatherius, that the Queſtiond Definition of Heat may be Demonſtrated, by the Definition which is wont to be given and Acquieſcd in, of its contrary Quality, Cold, whoſe property is taught to be tam Homogenea, quam Heterogenea congregare;3 Give me leave to repreſent to You, that neither is this eſinition unqueſtionable; for not to Mention the Exceptions, which a Logician, as ſuch, may Take at it, I Conſider that the Union of Heterogeneous Bodies which is Supposd to be the Genuine Production of Cold, is not Performd by every Degree of Cold. For we ſee for Inſtance that in the Urine of Healthy Men, when the Liquor has been Sufferd a while to ſtand, the Cold makes a Separation of the Thinner Part ſfrom the Groſſer, which Subſides to the Bottom, and Growes Opacous there 3 whereas if the Urinal be Wamie, theſe Parts readily Mingle again, and the whole Liquor becomes Tranſparent asbeſore. And when, by Glaciation, Wood, Straw, Duſt, Water, &c. are Supposd to be United into one Lump of Ice, the Cold does not Cauſe any Real Union or Adunation, (if I may ſo Speak) of theſe Bodies, but only Hardening the Aqueous Parts of the Liquor into Ice, the other Bodies being Accidentally Preſent in that Liquor are frozen up in it, but not Really Unitedl. And accordingly if we Expoſe a Heap of Mony Conſiſting of Gold, Silver and Copper Coynes, or any other Bodies of Differing Natures, which are Deſtitute om Aqueous Moiſture, Capable of Congelation, to never ſo intenſe a Cold, we find not that theſe Differing Bodies are at all thereby ſo much as Compacted, much leſs United together; and even in Liquors Themſclves we find Phænomena which Induce us to Queſtion the Definition which we are examining. If Paracelſus his Authority were 1o be ]ookt upon as a Sutſicient Proof in matters of this Nature, I might here inſiſt on that Proceſs of his, whereby he Teaches that the Eſſence of Wine may be Sever'd ſrom the Phlegme and Ignoble Part by the Aſſiſtance of Congelation: and becauſe much Weight has been laid upon this Proceſs, not only by Paracelſians, but other Writers, ome of whom ſeem not to have perus d it themſelves, Iſhall give You the entire Paſſage in the Authors own Words, as I lately found them in the ſixth Book of his Archidoxis, an Extract whereof I have yet about me; and it ſounds thus. De Vino ſciendum eſt, fæcem phlegmaque ejus eſſe Mineram, & Vini ſubstantiam eſſe corpus in quo conſervatur Eſſentia, prout auri in aure latet Eſſentia. Juxta quod Praficam nobis ad Memoriam ponimis, ut noœ obliviſcamur, ad hunc modum: Recipe Vinum vetustiſſimum & optimum quod habere poteris, calore ſaporeque ai placitum, hoc in vas vitreum infundas ut tertiam ejus partem impleat, & ſigillo Hermetis occluſum in equino ventre menſibus quatuor, & in coutinuato colore teneatur qui non deficiat. Quo percẽto, Hyeme cum frigus & gelu maxime ſæviunt, his per menſem exponatur ut congeletur. Ad hunc modum frigus vini ſpiritum una cum ejus ſubstantia protrudit in vini centrum, ac ſeparat a phlegmate : Congelatum abjice, quod vero congelatum non est, id Spiritum cum ſubstantia eſſe judicato, Hunc in Pelicanum poſitum in arenæ digestione non adeo calida per aliquod tempus manere ſinito; Polmodum eximito vini Magiſterium, de quo locuti ſumus. But I dare not Eleu. lay much Weight upon this Proceſs, becauſe I have found that if it were True, it would be bur ſeldom Practicable in this Country upon the beſt Wine: for Though this preſent Winter hath been Extraordinary Cold, yet in very Keen Froſts accompanied with laſting Snowes, I have not been able in any Meaſure to Freeze a thin Vial full of Sack; and even with Snow and Salt Jcould Freeæe little more then the Surface of it3 and I ſuppoſe Elex.. that tis not every Degree of Cold that is Capable of Comgealing Liquors, if I may ſocall it) of them by Separating their Aqueous and Spirituous Parts; for I have ſometimes, though not often, ſreZen ſeverally, Red-wine, Urine and Milk, but could not Obſerve the expected Separation. And the Duich-Men that were fordd to Winter in that Icie Region neer the Artick Circle, calld Nova Zembla, although they relate, as we ſhall ſee below, that there was a Separation of Parts made in their ſrozen Beer about the middle of November, yet of the Freezing of their Back in December following they give but this Account: Tea and our Sack, which is ſo hot, was Frozen very hard, ſo that when me were every Man to have his part, we were fordd to meli it in the Fire; hich we ſvara every ſecond Day, about half a Pinte for a Man, wherewith we ere fordd to ſiilain our ſelves. In which words they imply not, that their Back was divided by the Froſt into differing Subſtances, after ſuch manner as their Beer had been. All which notwithſtanding, Elea. ſuppoſe that it may be made to appear, that even Cold ſometimes may Cosgregare Homogenea, & Heterogenea Segregare:and to Manifeſt poſely cauſe to be Decocted in ſair Water a Plant abounding with Sulphureous and Spirituous Parts, and having expos'd the Decoction to a keen NorthWind in a very Froſty Nignt, I obſerv'd, that the more Aqueous Paris of it were tur'd by the next Morning into Ice, towards the innermoſt part of which, the more Agile and Spirituous parts, as I then conjecturd, having Retreated, to ſhun as much as might be their Environing Enemy, they had there preſerv'd themſelves unſrozen in the Form of a high colourd Liquor, the Aqueous and Spitituous parts having been ſo ſleightly (Blended rather than) United in the Decoction, that they were eaſily Sepatable by ſuch a Degree of Cold as would not have been able to have Divorœd the Parts of Urine or Wine, which by Fermentation or Digeſtion are wont; as Tryal has informd me, to be more intimately aſſociated each with other.But I have already intimated, Eleutherius, that I ſhall not Inſiſt on this Experiment, not only becauſe, having made it but once I may poſſibly have Been miſtaken init but alſo (and that principally) becauſe of that much more ſull and eminent Experiment of the Separative Virtue of extream Cold, that was made, againſt their Wills, by the forementiond Dutch men that Winter'd in Nova Zembla; the Relation of whoſe Voyage being a very ſcarce Book, it will not be amiſs to give you that Memorable part of it which concerns our preſent Theme, as I causd the Paſſage to be extracted out of the Engliſhed Voyage it ſelf. s Gerard de Veer, John Cornelyſon and  Others, ſent out of Amſterdam, s Anno Dom. 1596. being forœd by uns ſeaſonable Weather to Winter in Nos va Zembla, neer Ice-Haven; on the sc thirteenth of Otober, Three of us s (ſayes the Relation) went aboard the sc Ship, and laded a Sled with Beer; s but when we had laden it, thinking ec to go to our Houſe with it, ſuddenl c there aroſe ſuch a Winde, and ſo sc great a Storm and Cold, that we sc were ſorcd to go into the Ship again, sc becauſe we were not able to ſtay withs out 3 and we could not get the Beer s into the Ship again, but were forc d sc to let it ſtand without upon the Sled: sc the Fourteenth, as we came out of s the Ship, we found the Barrel of Beer c ing upon the Sled, but it was faſt fros zen at the Heads; yet by reaſon of s the great Cold, the Beer that purgæd c out froze as hard upon the Side of  the Barrel, as if it had been gld  thereon: and in that ſort we drew  jt to our Houſe, and ſet the Barrel an s end, and drank it up; but firſt we were sc ſord to melt the Beer, for there was c ſcarce any unſrozen Beer in the barrel;  but in that thick Yieſt that was un-  frozen lay the Strength of the Beer, ' ſo that it was too ſtrong todrink alone,  and that which was frozen taſted like  Water; and being meited we Mixd  one with the other, and ſo drank ec jt3 but it had neĩther Strength nor c Talte. And on this Occaſion I remember, that having the laſt very Sharp Winter purpoſely tryd to Freeze, among other Li quors, ſome Beer moderately ſtrong, in Glaſs Veſſels, with Snow and Salt, I obſerv'd, that there came out of the Neck a certæin thick Subſtance, which, it ſeems, was much better able then the r eſt of the Liquor (that I found turn'd into Ice) to reſiſt a Froſt, and which, feſtly enough to be Yieſt, whereat, I conteſs, I ſomewhat marvailid, becauſe Idid not either diſcerne' by the Taſte, or find by Enquiry, that the Beer was at all too New to be very fit to be Drank. Imight confirm the Dutchmens Relation, by what happend a while ſince to a neerẽ Friend of mine, who complained to me, that having Brewd ſome Beer or Ale for his own drinking in Holland (where he then dwelt) the Keenneſs of the late bitter Winter ſroze the Drink ſo as to reduce it into Ice, and a ſmall Proportion of a very Strong and Spirituous Liquor. But I muſt not entertain you any longer concerning Cold, not onely becauſe you may think I have but loſt my way into a Theme which does not directly belong to my preſent Undertaking; but becauſe I have already enlarg'd my ſelf too much upon the firſt Conſideration I proposd, though it appears ſo much a Paradox, that it ſeemd to Require that I ſhould ſay much to keep it from being thought a meere Extravagance; yet ſince I Undertook but to make the common Aſſumption of our Chymiſts and Aristotelians appear Queſtionable, I hope I have ſo Perſormd that Task, that I may now Proceed to my Following Conſiderations, and Inſiſt leſſe on them than I have done on the Firſt. San aꝶRRnOa AS  R S tocct)ſ **ærꝶ1°-35a35ũ⸗ THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Second Part. He Second Conſideration I Deſire to have Notice Taken of, is This, That it is not ſo Sure, as Both Chymiſts and Ariſtotelians are wont to Think it, that every Seemingly Similar or Diſtinct Subſtance that is Separated ſrom a Bodyby the Help of the Fire, was Pre exiſtent in it as a Principle or Element of it. That I may not make this Paradox a Greater then I needs muſt, I will Firſt Briefly Explain what the Propoſition means, before I proceed to Argue forit. And I ſuppoſe You will ealily Believe That I do not mean that any thing is ſeparable ſrom a Body by Fire, that was not Marerially pre- exiſtent in it3 for it Far Exceeds the power of Meerly Naurall Agents, and Conſequenty of the Fire, i0 produce anew, ſo Much as one Atome of Matter, which they can but Modifie and Alter, not Create; which is ſo Obvious a Truth, that almoſt all Sects of Philoſophers have Denyd the Power of producing Matter to Second Cauſes3 and the Epicureans and ſome Others have Done the Like, in Reference to their Gods themſelves. Nor does the Propoſition peremptorily Deny but rhat ſome Things Obtaid by the Fire from a Mixt Body, may have been more then barely Materially pre-exiſtent in it, ſince there are Concretes, which before they be Exposd to the Fire afford us ſeveral Documents of their abounding, ſome with Salt, and Others with Sulphur. For it will ſerve the preſent Turn, if it appear that diverſe things Obtaind from a Mixt Body expos'd to the Fire, were not its lngredients Before: for if this be nough to ſuſpect that Chymiſts may Decieve themſelves, and Others, in concluding Reſolutely and Univerſally, thoſe Subſtances to be the Elementary Ingredients of Bodies barely ſeparated by the Fire, of which it yet may be Doubted Whether there be ſuch or No; at leaſt till ſome other Argument then that drawn from the Analjſis be Brought to reſolve the Doubx. That then which IMean by the Propoſition I am Explaining, is, That it may without Abſurdity be Doubted whether or no the Diftering Subſtances Obtainable from a Concrete Diſſipated by the Fire were ſo Exſiſtent in ir in that Forme (atleaſt as to their minute Parts) wherein we find them when the Analyſis is over, that the Fire did only Dis- joyne and Extricate the Corpuſcles of one Principle ſrom thoſe of the other wherewith before they were Blended. Having thus Explaind my Propoſition, I ſnhall endeavour to do two things, to prove it3 The firſt of whichis to ſhew rthat ſuch Subſtances as Chymiſts call Principles May be produc'd De novo (as they ſpeak.) And the other is to make it probable that by the Fire we may Actually obtain from ſome Mixt Bodies ſuch Subſtances as were not in the Newly Expounded ſence, pre- exiſtent in them. To begin then with the Firſt of theſe, I Conſider that if it be as true astis prœpablc, that Compounded Bodies iffer from One Another but in the Various Textures Reſulting from the Bigneſs, Shape, Motion, and contrivance of their ſmal parts. It will not be Irrationall to conceive that one and the ſame parcel of the Univerſal Matter may by Various Alterations and Contextures be brought to Deſerve the Name, ſomtimes of a Sulphureous, and ſometimes of a Terrene, or Aqueous Body. And this T could more largely Explicate, but that our Friend Mr. Bojle has promis'd us ſomething about Qualities, wherein the Theme ſ now willingly Reſign him, Will T Queſtion not be Studiouſly Enquired into. Wherefore what I ſhall now advance in favour of what Ihave lately Deliverd ſmall be Deduc'd from Experiments made Divers Years ſince. The firſt of which would have been much more ſiderable, but that by ſome intervening Accidents Iwas Neceſſitated to loſe the beſt time of the year, for a trial of the Nature of that Ideſignd; it being about he middle of a;3 before I was able to begin an Experiment which ſnould have then been two moneths old; but ſuch as it was, it will not perhaps be impertinent 10 Give You this Narrative of it. At the rime newly Mention'd, Icausd My Gardiner (being by Urgent Ocaſions Hinder d from being preſent myſelſ) to dig cut a convenient quantity of good Earth, and dry it well in an Oven, to weighit, to put it in an Earthen pot almoſt evel with the Surſace of the ground, ænd to ſet init a ſelected ſeed he had before received from me, for that purpoſe, of Squaſh, whichis an Indian kind of Pompion, that Growes apace; this ſced I Ordered Him to Water only with Rain or Spring Water. I did not ( when my Occaſions permitted me to viſit it) without delight behold how ſaſt it Grew, thoughunſeaſonably ſown; but the Haſtning Winter Hinderd it from artaining any thing neer its due and Wonted magnitude ( for I found the ſame Autumn, in my Garden, ſome of thoſe plants, by Meaſure, as big about as my Middle) and made me order the having it taken Up;3 Which about the Middſe of Otober was carefully Done by the ſame Gardiner, who a while aſter ſent me this account of it3 I have eighed the Pompion with the Stalk and Leaves, all whico weighed three pound wanting a quarter; Then I took the Earth, baed it as formerly, and found it just as much as Idid at Firſt, hich made me think Ibad not dryd it Sufficiently: then I put it into the Oven twice More, after the Bread was Drawn, and Weighed it ihe Second time, but found it Shrint little or nothing. But to deal Candidly with You, Eleutherius, I muſt not conceal ſrom You the Event of another Experiment of this Kind made this preſent Summer, wherein the Earth ſeems to have been much more. Waſted3 as may appear by the following account, Lately ſent me by the ſame Gardiner, in theſe Words. To give You an Account of your Cucumbers, I have Gaind two Indiſſerent Fair Ones, the weight of them is ten Pound and a Halfe, the Branches with the Roots weighed four Pounds wanting two Ounces 3 and uwhen I had weighed them I took the Earth, and bak d it in ſeveral ſmall Earthen Diſhes in an Oven ; and when I had ſo done, I found the Earth wanted a Pound and a halfe of what it was formerly; yet I was not ſatisd, doubting the Earth was not dry: Iput it into an Oven the Second Time, afiter the Bread was drawn) and aſter I had taten it out and weighed it, I found it to be the Same weight : So Suppoſe there was no Moiſture leſt in the Earth. Neither do I think that the Pourd and Halfe that was wanting as Drawn away by the Cucumter but a great Part of it in the Ordering was in Duſt and the like) waſted : (the Cucumbers are hept by themſelves, leſt Tou ſbould ſend for them) But yet in this Tryal, Eleutherius, it appears that though ſome of the Earth, or rather the diſſoluble Salt harbourd in it, were waſted, the main Body of the Plant conſiſted of Tranſmuted Water. And I might add, that a year aſter I causd the formerly mentioned Experiment, touching large Pompions, to be reiterated, with ſo good ſucceſs, that if my memory does not much miſ-inform me, it did not only much ſurpaſs an that I made before, but ſeemd ſtrangely to conclude what I am pleading for though (by reaſon I have unhappily loſt the particular Account my Gardiner writ me up of the Circumſtances) Idare not inſiſt upon them. The like Experiment may be as conveniently tryd with the ſeeds of any Plant, whoſe growth is haſty, and its ſize Bulky. IF Tobacco will in Theſe Cold Climates Grow well in Earth undung?d, it would not be amiſs to make a Tryal with it3 fortis an annual Plant, that ariſes where it proſpers, ſometimes as high as a Tall Man; and Ihave had leaves of it in my Garden neer a Foot and a Halfe broad. But the next time ITry this Experiment, it ſhall be with ſeveral ſeeds of the ſame ſort, in the ſame pot of Earth, that ſo the event may be the more Conſpicuous. But becauſe every Body has not Conveniency of time and place for this Experiment neither, I made in my Chamber, ſome ſhorter and more Expeditions Tryals. I took a Top of Spearmint, about an Inch Long, and put ĩt into a good Vial full of Spring water, ſo as the upper part of the Mint was above the neck o the Glaſs, and the lower part Immers'd in the Water3 within a few Dayes this Mint began to ſhoot forth Roots into the Water, and to diſplay its Leaves, and aſpire upwards 3 and in a ſhort time ithad numerous Roots and Leaves, and theſe very ſtrong and fragrant of the Odour of the Mint: but the Heat of my Chamber, as I ſuppoſe, killd the Plant when it was grown to have a pretty thick Stalk, which with the various and ramified Roots, which it ſhot into the Water as if it had been Earth, preſented in iĩts Tranſparent Flower-pot a Spectacle not unpleaſant to behold. The like I tryyd with ſweet Marjoram, and I tound the Experiment ſucceed alſo, though ſomewhat more ſlowly, with Balme and Peniroyal, to name now no other Plants. And one of theſe Vegetables, cheriſh d only by Water, having obtaid a competent Growth, I did, for Tryals ſake, cauſe to be Diſtill'd in a ſmall Retort, and thereby obtaind ſome Phlegme, a little Empyreumaticall Spirir, a ſmall Quantity of aduſt Oyl, and a Caput mortuæm ; which appearing to be a Coal concluded it to conſit of Salt and Earth: bur the Quantity of it was ſo ſmall that I forbore to Calcine it. The Water I usd to nouriſh t his Plant was not ſhiſted nor renewed; and I choſe Springwater rather than Rain- water, becauſe the latter is more diſcernably a kinde of rmiula, which, though it be granted to be freed from groſſer Mixtures, ſeems yet to Contain in it, beſides the Steams of ſeveral Bodies wandering in the Air, which may be ſuppos d to impregnate it, a certain Spirituous Subſtance, which may be Extracted out of it, and is by ſome miſtaken for the Spirit of the World Corporifyd, upon what Grounds, and with what Probability, I may elſewhere perchance, but muſt not now, Diſcourſe to you. But perhaps I might have ſav'd a great part of my Labour. For I finde that Helmont (an Author more conſiderable for his Experiments than many Learned men are pleasd to think him) having had an Opportunity to proſecute an Experiment much of the ſame nature with thoſe I have been now ſpeaking of, for five Years together, obtaind at the end of that time ſo notable a Quantity of Tranſmuted Waeer, that I ſnould ſcarce Think it fit to have his Experiment, and Mine Mentiond together, were it not that the Length of Time Requiſile to this may deterr the Curioſity of ſome, and exceed the leaſure of Others;and partly, that ſo Paradoxical a Truth as that which theſc Experiments ſecm to hold forth, needs to be Confirmd by more Witneſſes then one, eſpecially ſince the Extravagancies and Untruths to be met with in Heloxts Treatiſe of the Magnetick Cure of Wounds, have made his Teſtimonies ſuſpected in his other Writings, though as to ſome of the Unlikely matters of Fact he delivers in them, Imight ſafely undertake to be his Compurgator. But that Experiment of his whichI was mentioning to You, he ſaycs, was this. He took 200 pound of Earth dryd in an Oven, and having put it into an Earthen Veſſcl and moiſtend it with Raine water he planted in it the Trunk ofa VVillow tree of five pound VVeight; this he Vaterd, as need required, with Rain or with Diſtill'd VVater3 and to keep the Neighbouring Earth ſrom getting into the Veſſcll, he employd a plate of Iron tind over and perI forated with many holes. Five years being effluxd, he took out the Tree and weighed: it, and (with computing the leaves that fell during four Autumnes) he found it to weigh 169 pound, and about three Ounces. And Having again Dryd the Earth it grew in, he found it want of its Former VVeight of 200 Pound, about a couple only of Ounces; ſo that 16 pound oſ the Roots, VVood, and Bark, which Conftituted the Tree, ſeem to have Sprung from the VVater. And though it appears not that Helmost had the Curioſity to make any Analyſis of this Plant, vet what I lately told Yon I did to One of the Vegetables I nouriſh'd with VVater only, willl ſuppoſe keep You from Doubtmg that if he had Diſtill'd this Tree, it would have afforded him the like Diſtinct Subſtances as another Vegerable of the ſame kind. T need not Subjoyne that I had it alſo in my thoughts to try how Experiments to the fame purpoſe with thoſe I related to You would ſucceed in other Bodies then Vegetables, becauſe importunate Avocations having hitherto hinderd me ſrom putting my Deſign in Practiſe, I can yet ſpeak but Confecturally of the Succeſs: but the beſt is, that the Experiments already made and mention'd to you need not the Aſſiſtance of new Ones, to Verifie as much as my preſent task makes it concern me to prove by Experiments of this Nature. One would ſuſpcct (ſayes Eleutherius after his long ſilence) by what You have been diſcourſing, that You are not far from Helmonts Opinion about the Origination of Compound Bodies, and perhaps too diſlike not the Arguments which he imployes to prove it. VVhat Helmontias Opinion, and what Arguments do you mean (askes Carneades.) VVhat Yon have been Newly Diſcourſing ( replies Eleutherius) tells us, that You cannot but know that this bold and Acute Spagyriſt ſcruples not to Aſſert that all mixt Bodies ſpring from one Element; and that Vegetables, Animals, Marchaſites, Stones, Metalls, &c. are Matcrially but ſimple Vater diſguis'd into theſe Various Formes, by the plaſtick or Formative Virtue of thceir ſeeds. And as for his Reaſons you may find divers of them ſcatterd up and down his writings 3 the conſiderablſt of which ſeem to be theſe thee; The Uliimate Reduction of mixt Bodies into Inſipid Vater, the Viciſſitude of the ſuppoſed Elements, and the production of perſectiy mixt Bodies out of ſimple VVater. And firſt he affirmes that the Sal circulatus Paracelſi, or his Liquor Aleabeſt, does adæquately reſolve Plants, Animals, and Mincralls into one Liquor or more, according to their ſeveral internall Diſparitics of Parts (without Caput Mortuum”; or the Deſtruction of their ſominal Virtues3) and that the Altaheſt being abſtracted from theſe Liquors in the ſame weight and Virtue wherewith it Diſſolv'd them, the Liquors may by frequentCohobations from chalke or ſome other idoneous matter, be Totally deprivd of their ſeminal Endowments, and return at laſt to their ſirſt matter, Inſipid VVater; ſome other wayes he propoſes here and there, to diveſt ſome particular Bodies of their borrowd ſhapes, and make them remigrate to their firſt Simplicity. The ſecond. Topick whenca Helmont drawes his Arguments, to prove Vater to be the Material cauſe of Mixt Bodies, Itold You was this, that the other ſupposd Elements may be tranſmuted into one another. But the Experiments by him here and there produc'd on this Occaſion, are ſo uncalie to be made and to be judgd of, that I ſtall not inſit on them; not to mention, that if they were granted to be true, his Inference from them is ſomewhat diſputable;and therefore Iſhall paſs on to tell You, That as, in his Firſt Argument, our Paradoxical Author endeavours to prove Water the Sole Element of Mixt Bodies, by their Ultimate Reſolution, when by his Altaheſt, or ſome other conquering Agent, the Seeds have been Deſtroy'd, which Diſguis'd them, or when by time thoſe ſeeds are Wearid or Exantlated or unable to Act their Parts upon the Stage of the Univerſe any Longer: So in his Third Argument he Endeavours to evince the ſame Concluſion, by the conſtitution of Bodies which he aſſeris to be nothing but Water Subdud by Seminal Virtues. Of this he gives here and there in his Writings ſeveral Inſtances, as to Plants and Animals; but divers of them being Difficult either to be try'd or to be Underſtood, and others of them being not altogether Unobnorious to Exceptions, Ithink you have ſingſ'd out the Principalnnd leſs Queſtionable Experiment when you lately mention'd that of the. Willow Tree. And having thus, Continues Eleutherius, to Anſwer your Queſtion, given Jo1 a Summary Account of whar I am Gonfident You know bettr then Ido, I ſhall be very glad to receive Your Sence of it, it the giving it me will not too much Divert You ſrom the Proſecution of your Diſcourſe. That If (replies Carneades) was not necdleſly annexd: for thorowly to examine ſuch an Hypoihefis and ſuch Arguments would ręquire ſo many Conſiderations, and Conſequently ſo much timo, that Iſhould not now have the Lieſure to perſfect ſusha Digreſſion, and much leſs to ſiniſh my Principle Diſcourſe. Yet thus much I (hall tell You at preſent, that you need not feav my rejecling this Opinionifor its Novelty; ſince, however the Helmontians may in complement to their Maſter pretend it to bo a new Diſcovery, Yer though the Arguments be for the moſt part his, the ogenes Laertius and divers other Authors ſheat of Thales, as the firſt among theGræcians that made diſquiſitions upon nature. And of this Thales, I Remember, Tally informes us, that he taught all things were at firſt made of Water. And it ſeems by Plutarch and Justin Mortyr, that the Opinion was Ancienter then he: For they tell us that he us'd to defend his Tene tby the Teſtimony of Homer. And a Greek Author, (the Scholioqt of Apollonius) upon theſe Words EEE iC65| 25 dumn The Earth of Slime was made, Affirms (out of Zeno) that the Chass, whereof all things were made, was, according to Heſiod, Water3 which, ſettling firſt, became Slime, and then condensd into ſolid Earth. And the ſame Opinion about the Generation of Slime ſeems to have been entertain'd by Orpheus, out of whom one oſ the Antients cites this Teſtimony, Ex aẽ 7durot iavi nætięn. It ſeems alſo by what is delivered in Strobo out of another Author, concerning the Indians, Tnat they likewiſe held that all things had differing Beginnings, but that of which the World was made, was Woater. And rhe like Opinion has been by ſome of the Antients aſcribd to the Phœnicians, ſfrom whom Thales himſelf is conceivd to have borrowd it; as probably ihe Greeks did much of their Thelogie, and, as I am apt to ihink, of their Philoſophy too; ſince the Deviſing of the Atomical Hypotheſis commonly aſcribbd to Lucippus and his Diſciple Democritus, is by Learmed Men attributed to one Moſchus a Phænician. And poſſibly the Opinion is yet antienter than ſo; For tis known that the Pbænicians borrow'd moſt of their Learning from the Hebrews. And among thoſe that acknowledge the Books of Mcſes, many have been inclid to think Water to have been the Primitive and Univerſal Matter, by peruſing the Beginning of Geneſis, where the Waters ſeem to be mentiond as the Material Cauſe, not only of Sublunary Compounded Bodies, but of all thoſe that make up the Univerſe; whoſc Component Parts did orderly, as it were, emerge ous of that vaſt Abyſſe, by the Operation of the Spirit of God, who is ſaid to have been moving Himſelf as hatching Femates do ſas the Original nD v, Meracephet is ſaid to Im- I port, and as it ſeeins to ſignifie in one? of the two other places, wherein alone I have met with it in the Hebrew Bible) 3 upon the Face of the Waters; which being, as may be ſuppos'd, Divinely Impregnated with the ſeeds oſ all things, were by that productive Incubation quãlifyd to produce them. Bur you, I prèſume, Expect that I ſould Diſcourſe of this Matter like a Naturaliſt, not a Philologer. Whereſfore I ſhall add, to Countenance Helmont's Opinion, That whereas he gives not, that Iremember, any Inſtance of any Mineral Body, nor ſcarce of any Animal,generated of Water, a French Chymiſt, Monſieur de Rochas, has preſented his Readers an Experiment, which if it were punctually ſuch as he has deliverd it, is very Notable. He then, Diſcoui ſing of the Gencration of things according to certain Chymical and Metaphorical Notions (which I confeſs are not to me Intelligible) ſets down, among divers Speculations not pertinent to our Subject, the following Narrative, which I ſhall repeat to you the ſence of in Engliſh, with as little variation from the Literal ſence of the French words, as my memory will enable me. Having (ſayes he) diſcernd ſuch great wonders by the Natural Operation of water, 1 would lnow what may be done with it by Art Imitating Nature. wherefore I took water which I well knew not to be compounded, nor to be mixd pith ony other thing than that Spirit of Life (whereof he had ſpoken before;) ond ith a Heat Artificial, Continual and Proportionate, I prepard and diſposd it bythe above mention'd Graduations of Coagulation, Congelation, and Fixation, untill it was turnd into Earth, which Earth produc d Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, I tell not what Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, for that is reſerv for amther Occaſion: but the Animals did Move of themſelves, Eat, c. and by the true Anatomie I made of them, I found that they mere composd of much Sulphur, litile Mercary, and leſi Salt. Ihe Minerals teganto grow and encreaſe by converting into their ovn Nature one part of the Earth thereunto diſposd ; they were ſolid and heavy. And by this truly Demonſtrative Science, namely Chymiftry, I found that they were composd of much Salt, litile Sulphur, and leſs Mercur. But (ſayes Carneades) I have ſome Suſpitions concerning this ſtrange Relation, which make me unwilling to Declare an Opinion of it, unleſs I were ſatisſicd concerning divers Material Citcumſtances that our Author has leſt unmentioned; though as for the Generation of Living Creatures, both Vegetable and Senſitive, it needs not ſeem Incredible, ſince we ſinde that our common water (which indeed is often Impreꝶnated with Variety of Seminal Principles and Rudiments) being long kept in a quiet place will putrifie and ſtink, and then perhaps too produce Moſs and little Worms, or other Inſects, according to the nature of the Seeds that were lurking in it. I muſt likewiſe deſire you to take Notice, that as Helmont gives us no Inſtance of the Production of Minerals out of Water, ſo the main Argument that he employs to prove that tfiey and other Bodies may be reſold into water, is drawn from the Operations of his Altahest, and conſequently canno be ſatisfactorily Examind by You and Me. Yet certainly (ſayes Eleutherims) You cannot but have ſomewhat wonderd as well as I, to obſerve how great a ſhare of Woater goes to the making up of Divers Bodies, whoſe Diſguiſes promiſe nothing neere ſo much. The Diſtillation o? Eeles, though it yielded me ſome Oyle, and Spirit, and Volatile Salt, beſides the Capat mortuum, yet were all theſe ſo diſproportionate to the Phlegm rhat came ſfrom them (and in which at ſirſt they boyld as in a Por of Water) that they ſeemd to have bin nothing but coagulated Phlegm, which does likewiſe ſtrangely abound in Vipers, though they are eſteemd very hot in Operation, and vill in a Convenient Aire ſurvive ſome dayes the loſs of their Heads and Hearts, ſo vigorous is their Vivacity. Mans Bloud it ſelſ as Spirituous, and as Elaborate a Liquor astis reputed, does ſo abound in Phlegm, that, the other Day, Diſtilling ſome of it on purpoſe to try the Experiment (as I had formerly done in Deers Bloud) out of about ſeven Ounces and a half of pure Bloud we drew neere ſix Ounces of Phlegm, before any of the more operative Principles began to ariſe, and Invite us to change the Receiver. And to ſatisſie my ſelſ that ſome of theſe Animall Phlegms were void enough of Spirit to deſerve that Name, I would not content my ſelf to taſte them only, but fruitleſly pourd on them acid Liquors, to try if they containd any Volatile Salt or Spirit, which (had there been any there) would probably have diſcoverd ĩt ſelf by making an Ebullition with the affuſed Liquor. And now I mention Corroſive Spirits, I am minded to Inſorme you, That though they ſeem to be nothing elſe but Fluid Salts, yet they abound in Water, as you may Obſerve, if either you Entangle, and ſo Fix their Saline Part, by making them Corrode ſome idoneous Body, or elſe if you mortifie it with a contrary Salt; as I have very maniſeſtly Obſervd in the making a Medecine ſomewhat like Helmom's Balſamus Samech, with Diſtill'd Vinager inſtead of Spirit of Wine, wherewith he prepares it: For you would ſcarce Beleeve (what I have lately Obſerv'd) that of that acid Spirit, the Salt of Tartar, from which taining the acid Salt turn into worthleſs Phlegm neere twenty times jts weight, before it be ſo ſully Impregnated as to rob no more Diſtilld Vinager of its Salt. And though Spirit of Wine Exquiſitely rectify d ſeem of all Liquors 1o be the moſt free ſrom Water, it being ſo Igneous that it will Flame all away without Icaving the leat Drop behinde it, yet even this Fiery Liquor is by Helmmt not improbably affirmd, in caſe what he relates be True, to be Materially Water, under a Sulphureous Diſguiſe: For, according to him, in the making that excellent Medecine, Paracelſus lis Balſamus Samech, (which is nothing but Sal Tartari dulcifyd by Diſtilling from it Spirit of Wine till the Salt be ſufficiently glutted with ĩts Sulphur, and ſuffer the Liquor to be dravn off, as ſtrong as it was pourd on) when the Salt of Tartar ſrom which it is Diſtill'd hath retaid, or deprivd it of the Sulphureous parts of the Spirit of Wine, the reſt, which is incomparably the greater part of the Liquor, will remigrate into Phlegm. Iadded that Clauſe [ In caſe what he Relaes be True] becauſc I have not as yet ſufficiently try'd ſelf. But not only ſomething of Experiment keeps me from thinking it, as many Chymiſts do, abſurd, ( thoughI have, as well as they, in vain try'd it with ordinary Salt of Tartar:) but beſides that Helmont often Relates it, and draws Conſequences from it 3 A Perſon noted for his Soberneſſe and Skill in Spagyrical Preparations, having been askt by me, Whether the Experiment might not be made to ſucceed, if the Salt and Spirit were prepard according to a way ſuitable to my Principles, he affirmd to me, that he had that way I proposd made Helmonts Experiment ſucceed very well, without àdding any thing to the Salt and Spirit. But our way is neither ſhort nor Eaſie. I have indeed (ſayes Carneades) ſometimes wonderd to ſee how much Phlegme may be obraid ſrom Bodies by the Fire. But concerning that Phlegme I may anon have Occaſion to note ſomething, which Itherefore ſhall not now anticipate. But to return to the Opinion of Thales, and of Helmont, l conſider, that ſuppoſing the Alkahest could reduce all Bodies into water, yet whether mentary, may not groundleſly be doubted; For I remember the Candid and Eloquent Petris Laurembergius in his Notes upon Sala's Aphoriſmes affirmes, that he ſaw an inſipid Aenstruum that was a powerſull Diſſolvent, and (if my Memory do not much miſ- informe me) could diſſolve Gold. And the water which may be Drawn from Quickſilver without Addition, though it be almoſt Taſtleſs, You will I believe think of a differing Nature from ſimple Water, eſpecially if you Digeſt in it Appropriated Mineralls. To which Iſhall add but this, that this Conſideration may be further extended. For I ſee no Neceſſity to conceive that the Water mention'd in the Beginning of Geneſis, as the Univerſal Matter, was ſimple and Elementary VVater; ſince though we ſhould Suppoſe it to have been an Agitated Congeries or Heap conſiſting of a great Variety of Seminal Principles and Rudiments, and of other Corpuſcles fi? to be ſubdud and Faſhiond by them, it might yet be a Body Fluid like Vater, in caſe the Corpuſcles it was made up of, were by their Creator made ſmall enough, and put into ſuch an actuall Motion as might make them Glide along one another. And as we now ſay, the Sea conſiſts of VVater, notwithſtanding the Saline, Terreſtrial, and other Bodies mingſd with it,) ſuch a Liquor may well enough be called VVater, becauſe that was the greateſt ofthe nown Bodies whereunto it was like3 Though, that a Body may be Fluid enough to appear a Liquor, and yet contain Corpuſcles of a very differing Nature, You will eaſily believe, if You but expoſe a good Quantity of Vitriol in a Itrong Veſſel to a Competent Fire. For although it contains both Aqucous, Earthy, Saline, Sulphureous, and Metalline Corpuſcles, yet the whole Maſs vill at firſt be Fluid like water, and boyle like a ſeething pot. I might eaſily ( Continues Carneades) enlarge my ſelf on ſuch Conſiderations, if Iwere Now Oblignd to give You my Judgment of the Thaleſian, and Helmontian, Hypotheſis. But Whether or no we conclude that all things were at firſt Generated of Water, I may Deduce from what I have tryd Concerning the Growth of Vegetables, nouriſnd with water, all that I now proposd to my Selt or need at preſcnt to prove, namely that Salt, Spirit, Earth, andev'n Oyl (though that be thought oſ all Bodies the moſt oppoſite to Water) may be producd out i Water ; and conſequently that a Chymical Principle as well as a Peripatetick Element, may (inſome caſes) be Generated anew, or obtaind from ſuch a parcel of Matter as was not endow'd with the form of ſuchaprinciple orElement before. And having thus, Eleutheriis, Evincd thattis poſſible that ſuch Subſtances as thoſe that Chymiſts are wont to call their Tria Prima, may be Generated, anew: Imuſt next Endeavour to make it Probable, that the Operation of the Fire does Actually (ſometimes) not only divide Compounded Bodies into ſmal Parts, but Compound thoſe Parts after a new Manncr;3 whonce Conſcquently, for ought we Know, there may Emerge as well Saline and Sulphureous Subſtances, as Bodies of other Textures. And perhaps it will aſſiſt us in our Enquiry after the Effects of the Operations of the Fire upon other Bodies, to Conſider a little, what it does to thoſe Mixtures which being Productions ol the Art of Man, We beſt know the Com; poſition of. You may then be pleasd to take Notice that though Sope is made up by the Sope-Boylers of Oyle or Greaſe, and Salt, and Water b ligently Incorpora.ed togethe?, yet if You expoſe the Maſs they Conititute to a Graduall Fire in a Retort, You ſhall then indeed make a Separation, but not of the ſame Subſtances that were United into Sope, but of others of a Diſtant and yet not an Elementary Nature, and eſpecially of an Oyle very ſharp and Fætid, and of a very Differing Quality from that which was Employd to make the Sope: ſo if you Mingle in a due Proportion, Sal Armoniack with Quick- Lime, and Diſtill them by Degrees of Fire, You ſhall not Divide the Sal Armoniack from the Quick- Lime, though the one be a Volatile, and the other a Fix'd Subſtance, but that which will aſcend will be a Spirit much more Fugitive, Penetrant, and ſtinking, then Sal Armoniact 3 and there vill remain with the Quick- Lime all or very near all the Sea Salt that concurrd to make up the Sal Armoniack; concerning which Sea Salt I ſhall, to ſatisſie You how well it was United to the Lime, informe You, that Ihave by making the Fire at length very Vehement, caus'd both the Ingrcdients to melt in the Retort it ſelf into one Maſs and ſuch Maſſes are apt to Relent in the Moiſt Air. If it be here Objected, that theſe Inſtances are taken from factitious Concretes which are more Compounded then thoſe which Nature produces; I ſallreply, that beſides that I have Mention'd them as much to Illuſtrate what I propos'd, as to prove it, it will be Diſſicult to Evince that Nature her ſelf does not make Decompound Bodies, I mean mingle together ſuch mixt Bodies as are already Compounded of Elementary, or rather of more ſimple ones. For Vitriol (for Inſtance) though I have ſometimes taken ĩt out of Minerall Earths, where Nature had without any aſſiſtance of Art prepard it to my Hand, is really, though Chymiſts are pleasa to reckon it among Salts, a De-compounded Body Conſiſting  as I ſhall have occaſion to declare anon )of a Terreſtriall Subſtance, of a Metal, and alſo of at leaſt one Saline Body, of a peculiar and not Elementary Nature. And we ſee alſo in Animals, that theit blood may be compos'd of Divers very Differing Mixt Bodies, ſince we find it obſervd that divers Sea- Fowle taſt rank of the Fiſhon which they ordinarily feed; and Hipocrates himſel? Obſerves, that a Child may be purgd by the Milke of the Nurſe, if ſe have taken Elaterium 3 which argues that the purging Corpuſcles of the Medicament Concurr to make up the Milke of the Nurſe and that white Liquor is generally by Phyſitians ſuppos’d to be but blanchd and alterd Blood. AndI remember I have obſerv'd, not farr from the Alps, that at a certain time of the Year the Butter of that Country was very Offenſive to ſtrangers, by reaſon of the rank taſt of a certain Herb, whereon the Cows were then wont plentiſully to feed. But (proceeds Carneades) to give you Inſtances of another kind, to ſhew that things may be obtain'd by the Fire ftom a Mixt Body that were not Pre-exiſtent in it, let Me Remind You, that from many Vegetables therę may without any Additionbe Obtaind Glaſs, a Body, which I preſume You vill not ſay was Pre-exiſtent in it, but produd by the Fire. To which Iſhall add but this one Example more, namely that by a certain Aruificial way of handling Quickſilver, You may without Addition ſeparate from it at leaſt a 5th. or 4th.part of a clear Liquor, which with an Ordinary Peripatetick would paſs for VWater, and which a Vulgar Chymiſt would not ſcruple to call Phlegme, and which, for ought I have yet ſeen or heard, is not reducible into Mercury aain, and Conſcquently is more then a ſguiſe of it. Now beſides that divers Chymiſts will not allom Mercury to have any or at leaſt any Conſiderable Quantity of either of ihe Ignoble Ingredients, Earth and Vater3 Beſides this, Iſay, the great Ponderouſneſs of Quickſilver makes it very unlikely that it can have ſo much Water in it as may be thus obtaind from it, ſince Mercury weighs 12 or 14 times as much as wãter of the ſame Bulk. Nay for a further Confirmation oſ this Argument, I will add this Strange Relation, that two Friends oſ mine, the one a Phyſitian, and the other a Mathematician, and both of them Perſons of unſuſpected Credit, have Solemnly aſſured me, that aſter many Tryals chey made, to reduce Mercury into Water, in Order to a Philoſophicall Work, upon Gold (which yet, by the way, Iknow prov'd Unſuccesſull) they did once by divers Cohobations reduce a pound of Quickſilver into almoſt a pound of Water, and this without the Addition of any other Subſtance, but only by preſſing the Mercury by a Skillfully Managd Fire in purpoſely contrivd Veſſels. But of theſe Experiments our Friend (ſayes Carxeades, pointing at the Regiſter of this Dialogue) will perhaps give You a more Particular Account thenit is neceſſary for me to do: Since what Ihave now ſaid may ſufficiently evince, that the Fire may ſometimes as well alter Bodies as divide them, and by it we may obtain from a Mixt Body what was not Pre-cxiſtent in it. And how are we ſure that in no other Body what we call Phlegme is barely ſeparated, not Producd by the Action of the Fire: Since ſo many other Mixt Bodies are of a much leſs Conſtant, and more alterable Nature, then Mercury, by many Tricks it is wont to put upon Chymiſts, and by the Experiments I told You of, abour an hour ſince, Appears to be. But becauſe I ſhall ere long have Occaſion to reſume into Conſideration the Power of the Fire to produce new Concretes, Ifall no longer inſiſt on this Argument at reſent; only I muſt mind You, that. if bou will not dis-believe Helmonts Relations, You muſt confeſs that the Tria Prima are neither ingenerable nor incoruptible Subſtances; ſince by his Altabest ſome of them may be producd of Bodies that were before of another Denomination; and by the ſame powerſull Menstruum all of them maybe reduc'd into inſipid Water. Here Carneades was about to paſs on to his Third Conſideration, when Eleutherius being deſirous to hear what he could ſay to clear his ſecond General Conſideration from being repugnant to what he ſeemd to think the true Theory of Miſtion, prevented him by telling him, I ſomewhat wonder, Carreades, that You, who are in ſo many Points unſatisſicd with the Peripatetick Opinion touching the Elements and Mixt Bodies, ſhould alſo ſeem averſe to that Notion touching the manner of Miſtion, wherein out knowing that they do ſo) agree with moſt of the Antient Philoſophers that preceded Aristotle, and that for Reaſons ſo conſiderable, that divers Modern Naturaliits and Phyſitians, in other things unfavourable enough to the Spagyriſis, do in this caſe ſide with them againſt the common Opinion of the Schools. If you ſhould ask me (continues Eleutheris) what Reaſons Imean? I ſhould partly by the Writings of Seænertus and other learncd Men, and partly by my own Thoughts, be ſupplyd with more, then twere at preſent proper for me to Inſiſt largely on. And therefore I ſhall mention only, and that briefly, threc or four. Of theſe, Iſnhall take the Firſt from the ſtate of the Controverſie it ſelf, and the genuine Notion of Miſtion, which though much intricated by the Schoolmen, Itake in ſhort to be this. Ariſtotle, at leaſt as many of his Interpreters expound him, and as indeed he Teaches in ſome places, where he profeſſedly Diſſonts from the Antients, declares Miſtion to be ſuch a mutual Penetration, and perſect Union of the mingſd Elements, that there is no Portion of the mixt Body, how Minute ſoever, which does not contain All, and Every of the Four Elements, or in which, if you pleaſe, all the Elements are not. And Iremember, that he reprehends the Miſtion taught by the Ancients, as too ſleight or groſs, for this Reaſon, that Bodies mixt according to their Hypothe ſis, though they appear ſo to humane Eyes, would not appear ſuch to the acute Eyes of a Ly, whoſe perfecter Sight would diſcerre the Elements, if they were no otherwiſe mingled, than as his Predeceſſors would have it, to be but Blended, not United; whereas the Antients, though they did not all Agree about what kind of Bodies were Mixt, yet they did almoſt unanimouſly hold, that in a compounded Bodie, though the Miſtibilia, whether Elements, Principles, or whatever they pleas'd to call them, were aſſociated in ſuch ſmall Parts, and with ſo much Exactneſs, that there was no ſenſible Part of the Maſs but ſeen?d to be of the ſame Nature with the reſt, and with the whole; Yet as to the Atomes, or other Inſenſible Parcels of Matter, whereof each of the Miſcibilia conſifted, thev retain'd eachof them its own Nature, being ted with the reſt into one Bodie. So that although by virtue of this compoſition the mixt Body did perhaps obtain Divers new Qualities, yet ſtill the Ingredients that Compounded it, retaining their own Nature, were by the Deſtruction of the Compoſitum ſeparable from each other, the minute Parts diſingag d from thoſe of a differing Nature, and aſſociated with thoſe of their own ſort returning to be again, Fire, Earth, or Water, as they were before they chanc'd to be Ingredients of that Compoſitum. This may be explaind (Continues Eleatherius,) by a piece of Cloath made of white and black threds interwoven, wherein though the whole iece appear neither white nor black, ht of a reſulting Colour, that is gray, yet each of the white and black threds that compoſe it, remains what it was before, as would appear if the threds were pullPd aſunder, aod ſorted each Colour by it ſelf. This ( purſues Eleatherius) being, as I underſtand ir, the State of the Controverſie, and the Aristoteliuns afier their Maſter Commonly Defining, that Miſtion is Miſcitilium alieratorum Unio, that ſeems to comport much better with the Opinion of the Chymiſts, then with that of their Adverſaries, ſince according to that as the newly ment ond Example declares, there is but a Juxta-poſition of ſeparable Corpuſcles, retaining each its own Nature, whereas according to the Ariſiotelians, when what they are pleasd to calla mixt Body reſults from the Concourle of the Elements, the Miſcibilia cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be Alterd, as Deſtroyd, ſince there is no Part in the mixt Body, how ſmall ſoever, that can be calld cither Fir, or Air, or Water, or Earth. Nor indeed can I well underſtand, how Bodies can be mingl'd other wayes then as I have declard, or at leaſt how they can be mingl'd, as our Peripateticks would have it. For whereas Ariſtotle tells us, that if a Drop of Wine be put into ten thouſand Meaſures of Water, the Wine being Overpowerd by ſo Vaſt a Quantity of Water vill be turnd into it, he ſpeaks to my Apprehenſion, very improbably; For though One ſhould add to that Quantity of Woater as many Drops of Wine as would a Thouſand times exceed it all, yet by his Rule the whole Liquor ſhould not be a Crama, a Mixure of Wine and Water, wherein the Wine would be Predominant, but VVater only 3 Since the Wine being added but by a Drop at a time would ſtill Fall into nothing but Vater, and Conſequently would be turd into it. And if this would hold in Metals too, twere a rare ſecret for Goldſmiths, and Refiners; For by melting a Maſs of Gold, or Silver, and by but caſting into it Lead or Antimony, Grain after Grain, they might at pleaſure, within a reaſonable Compaſs of time, turn what Quantity they deſire, of the Ignoble into the Noblè Metalls. And indeed ſince a Pint of wine, and a pint of water, amount to about a Quart of Liquor, it ſeems maniſeſt to ſenſe, that theſe Bodies doe not Totally Penetrate one another, as one would have it3 but that each retains its own Dimenſions; and Conſequently, that they are by being Mingſ'd only divided into minute Bodies, that do but touch one another with their Surfaces, as do the Grains, of VVheat, Rye, Barley, &c. in a heap of ſeverall ſorts of Corn: And unleſs we ſay, that as when one meaſure of wheat, for Inſtance, is Blended with a hundred meaſures of Barley, there happens only a Juxta-poſition and Superficial Contact betwixt the Grains of wheat, and as many or thereabouts of the Grains of Barley. So when a Drop of wine is mingl'd with a great deal of water, there is but an Appoſition of ſo many Vinous Corpuſcles to a Correſpondent Number of Aqueous ones; Unleſs Iſay this be ſaid, I ſee not how that Abſurdity will be avoyded, whereunto the Stoical Notion of miſtion (namely by ou-ie, or Conſuſion) was Liable, according to which the leaſt Body may be co-extended with the greateſt: Since in a mixt Body wherein before the Elements were Mingſd there was, for Inſtance, but one pound of water to ten thouſand of Earth, yet according to them there muſt not be the leaſt part of that Compound, that Conſiſted not as well of Earth, as water. Bur I inſiſt, Perhaps, too long ( ſayes Eleutherius) upon the prooſs afforded me by the Nature of Miſtion: Wherefore I willbut name Two or Three other Arguments whereof the firſt mallbe, that according to Aristotle himſelf, the motion of a mixt Body ſollowes the Nature of the Predominant Element, as thoſe wherein the Earth prevails, tend towards the Centre of heavy Bodies. And ſince many things make it Evident, that in divers Mixt Bodies the Elementary Qualities are as well Active, though not altogether ſo much ſo as in the Elements Hhemſclves , it ſeems not reaſonable to deny the actual Exiſtence of the Elements in thoſe Bodies wherein they Operate. To which I ſhall add this Convincing Argument, that Experience manifeſts, and Ariſtotle Confeſſes it, that the Miſcibilia may be again ſeparated from a mixt Body, as is Obvious in the Chymical Reſolutions of Plants and Animalls, which could not be unleſs they did actually retain their formes in it? For ſince, according to Aristoile, and I think according to truth, there is but one common Maſs of all things, which he has been pleas'd to call Materia Prima 3 And ſince tis not therefore the Matter but the Forme that Conſtitutes and Diſcriminates Things, to ſay that dy, according to their Formes, but according to their Matter, is not to ſay that they remain there at all; Since although thoſe Portions of Matter were Earth and water, &c.beſore they concurr'd, yet the reſulting Body being once Conſtituted, may as well be ſaid to be ſimple as any oſ the Elements, the Matter being confeſſledly of the ſame Nature in all Bodies, and the Elementary Formes bein according to this Hpotheſis periſi'd an aboliã. And laſtly, and if we will Conſulte Chymical Experiments, we ſhall find the Advantages of the Chymical Doctrine above the Peripatetick Title little leſs then Palpable. For in that Operation that Refiners call Quartation, which they employ to purifie Gold, although thrẽe parts of Silver be ſo exquiſitely mingſd by Fuſion witha fourth Partof Gold ( Whence the Operation is Denominated) that the reſulting Maſs acquires ſeverall new Qualities, by virtue of the Compoſition, and that there is ſcarce any ſenſible part of it that is not Compos'd of both the metalls; Yet if You caſt this mixture into Aqua Fortis, the Silver will be diſſolvd in the Menſtruum, and the Gold like a dark or black Powder will fall to the Bottom ot it, and cither Body may be again reducd into ſuch a Metal as it was before, which ſhews: that it retaind its Nature, notwithſtanding its being mixt ꝑer Minima with the other: We likewiſe ſce, that though one part of pure Silver be mingled with cight or ten Parts, or more, oſ Lead, yet the Fire will upon the Cuppel eaſily and perfectly ſeparate them again. And that which IT would have you peculiarly Conſider on this Occaſion is, that not only in Chymicall Anatomies there is a Separation made of the Elementary Ingredients, but that ſome Mixt Bodies afford a very much greater Quantity of this or that Element or Principle than of another; as we ſee, that Turpentine and Amber yield much more Oyl and Sulphur than they do Water, whereas Wine, which is confeſs'd to be a perſectly mixt Bodie, yields but a little Inflamable Spirit, or Sulphur, and not much more Earth; but affords a vaſt proportion of Phlegm or water: which could not be, if as the Peripateticks ſuppoſe, every, even of the minuteſt Particles, vere of the ſame nature with the whole, and conſequently did contain both Earth and Watcr, and Aire, and Fire;3 Wherefore as to what Ariſtorle principally, and almoſt only Objects, that unleſs his Opinion be admirted, there would be no true and perfct Miſtion, but onely Aggregates or Heaps of contiguous Corpuſcles, which, though the Eye of Man cannot diſcerne, yet the Eye of a Lynx might perceive not to be of the ſame Nature with one another and with their Totum, as the Nature of Miſtion requires, if he do not beg the Queſtion, and make Miſtion to conſiſt in what other Naturaliſts deny to be requiſite to it, yet He at leaſt cbjocts That as a great Inconvenience which I cannot take ſor ſuch, till he have brought as Conſiderable Arguments as I have proposd to prove the contrary, to evince that Nature makes other Miſlions than ſuch as I have allowed, wherein the Miſcibilia are reducd into minuto Parts, and United as farr as ſenſe can diſcerne: which if You will not grant to be ſufficient for a true Miſtion, he muſt have the ſame Quarrel with Nature her ſelf, as with his Adverſaties. Wrherefore (Continues Eleutherius) I cannot but ſomewhat marvail that Carneades ſhould oppoſe the Doctrine of the Chymiſt in a Particular, whercin they do as well agree with his old Miſtreſs, Nature, as diſſent ſfrom his old Adverſary, Arittotle. Imuſt not Creplies Carneades) engage my ſelf at preſent to cxamine thoroWl the Controverſies concerning Miſtion: And if there were no third thing, but that I were reduc'd to embrace abſolutely and unreſervedly either the Opinion of Aristotle, or that of the Philoſophers that went before him, Iſhould look upon the latter, which the Chymiſts have adopted, as the more defenſible Opinion: But becauſe differing in the Opinions about the Elements from both Parties, Ithink I can take a middle Courſe, and Diſcourſe to you of Miſtion after a way that does ncither perfectly agree, nor perfectly diſagree with either, as Ivill not peremptorily define, whether there be nor Caſes whercin ſome Phænomena of Miſtion ſeemto favour the Opinion that the Chymiſts Patrons borrow'd of the Antients, I ſhall onſy endeavour to ſhew You that there are ſome caſes which may keep the Doubt, which makes up my ſecond General Conſideration ſrom being unreaſonable. I ſhall then ſreely acknowledge to You ( ſayes Carneades) that Iam not over well ſatisfi'd with the Doctrine that is aſcribed to Aristotle, concerning Miſtion, eſpecially ſince it teaches that the four Elements may again be ſeparated ſrom the mixt Body; whereas if they contind not init, it would not be ſo much a Separation as. a Production. And Ithink the Ancient Philoſophers that Preceded Arislotle,and Chymiſts who have ſince receivd the ſame Opinion, do ſpeak of this matter more intelligibly, if not more probably, then the Peripateticks: but though they ſpeak Congruouſly enough, to their believing, that there are a certain Number of Primogeneal Bodies, by whoſe Concourſe all thoſe we call Mixis are Generated, and which in the Deſtruction of mixt Bodies do barely part company, and recede ſrom one another, juſt ſuch as they were when they came together; yet I, who meet with very few Opinions that Ican entirely Acquieſce in muſt confeſs to You that I am inclin'd to differ not only from the Aristotelians, but from the old Philoſophers and the Chymiſts, about the Nature of Miſtion: And if You will give me leave, I ſhall Briefly propoſe to you my preſent Notion of it, provided you will look upon it, not ſo much as an Aſſertion as an Hypotheſis ; in talking of which Ido not nõw pretend to propoſe and debate the whole Doctrine of Miſtion, but to ſhew thattis not Improbable, that ſometimes mingſa ſubſtances may be ſo Itrictly urited, that it doth not by the uſuall Operations of the Fire, by which Chymiſts are wont to ſuppoſe themſelves to have made the Analyſes of mixt Bodies, ſufficiently appear, that in ſuch Bodies the Miſiibilia that concurrd to make them up do each of them retain its own peculiar Nature: and by the Spagyriſis Fires may be more eaſily exricated and Recoverd, than Alterd, either by a Change of Texture in the Parts oſ the ſame Ingredient, or by an Aſſociation ith ſome parts of another Ingredient more ſtrict than was that of the parts oſ this or that Miſcibile among themſelves. At theſe words ELex. having preſvd him to do what he pioposd, and promis'd to do wha: hæ deſirds; Iconſider then ( reſumes Carseades) that, not to mention thoſe improper Kinds of miſtion, wherein Honmogeææoxs Bodies are Joyn'd, as when Water is mingld with water, or two Veſſels ſull of the fame kind of Wine with one another, the miſtion Iam now to Diſcourſe of ſeems, Generally ſpeaking, to be but an Union per Minima of any two or more Bodies of differing Denominations;3 as when Aſhes and Sand are Colliquated into Glaſs or Antimony, and Iron into Regulus Martis,or Wine and Water are mingPd, and Sugar is diſſolv'd in the Mixture. Now in this general notion of Miſtion it does not appear clearly comprehended, that the Miſtibilia or Ingredients do in their ſmall Parts ſo retain their Nature and remain diſtinct in the Compound, that they may thence by the Fire be again taken aſunder: For though I deny not that in ſome Miſtions of certain permanent Bodics this Recovery of the ſame Ingredients may be made, yet Iam not coninc'd that it will hold in all or even in moſt, or that micall Experiments, and the true Notion of Miſtion. To explain this a little, l aſſume, that Bodies may be mingſd, and that very durably, that are not Elementary or reſolvd into Elements or Principles that they may be mingd; as is evident in the Regulis of Colliquated Antimony, and Iron newl mention'd; and in Gold Coyne, whic laſts ſo many ages;Wherein generally the Gold is alloyd by the mixture ofa quantity, greater or leſſer, ſin our Mints they uſe about a 12th. part) ofeither ſilver, or Copper, or both. Next, I conſider, that there being but one Univerſal matter of things, as tis known that the Aviſtotelians themſelves acknowledge, who call it Materia Prima ( about which nevertheleſs I like not all their Opinions,) the Portions of this matter ſeem to differ from One Another, but in certain Qualities or Accidents, fewer or more; upon whoſe Account the Corporeal Subſtance they belong to receives its Denomination, and is referſd to this or that particular ſort of Bodies ;3 ſo that ifit come to loſe, or be deprivd of thoſe Qualities, though it ceaſes not to be a Body, yet it ceaſes ſfrom being that kind of Bodyas a Plant, or Animal, or Red, Green, Sweet, Sowre, or the like. Iconſider that it very often happens that the ſmall arts of Bodies cohere together but by immediate Contact and Reſt; and that however, there are ſew Bodies whoſe minute Parts ſtick ſo cloſe together, to what cauſe ſoever their Combination be aſcribd, but that it is poſſible to meet with ſome other Body, whoſe ſmall Parts may get between them, and ſo dis- joyn them; or may be fitted to cohere more ſtrongly with ſome of them, then thoſe ſome do with the reſt; or at leaſt may be combind ſo cloſely with them, as that neither the Fire, nor the other uſual Inſtrumęnts of Chymical Anatomies will ſeparate them. Theſe things being promisd, IWill not peremptorily deny, but that there may be ſome Cluſters of Particles, wherein the Particles are ſo minute, and the Coherence ſo ſtrict, or both, that when Bodies of Differinig Denominations, and conſiting of ſuch durable Cluſters, happen to be mingl'd, though the Compound Body made up of them may be very Differing from eſther o the Ingredients, yet each of the little Maſſes or Cluſters may ſo retãin its own Nature, as to be again ſeparable, ſuch as it was before. As when Gold and Silver being melted together in a Due Proportion ( for in every Proportion, the Refiners will tell Yoũ that the Experiment will not ſucceed) Aqua Fortis will diſſolve the Silver, and ſeave the Gold untoucht; by which means, as you lately noted, both the Metalls may bo recover'd ſrom the mixed Maſs. But ( Continues Carneades) there are other Cluſters wherein the Particles ſick not ſo cloſe together, but that they may meet with Corpuſcles of another Dènomination, which are diſposd to be more cloſely United with ſome of them, then theywere among themſelves. And in ſuch caſe, to thus eombining Corpuſcles loſing that Shape, or Size, or Motion, or orther Accident, upon whoſe Account they were endow d with ſuch a Determinate Quality or Nature, each ofthem really ceaſcs to be a Corpuſcle of the ſamè Denomination it was beſore ; and from the Coalition of theſe there may emerge a new Body, as really one, as either of the Corpuſcles was before they were mingſd, ot, if you pleaſe, Confounded: Since this Concretion is really endow'd with its own Diſtinct qualities, andcan no more bythe Fire, or any oher known way of nalyſis, be divided again into the Corpuſcles that at firſt concurrd to make it, than eĩthèr of them could by the ſame means be ſubdivided into other Particles. But (ſayes Eleutherius) to make this more intelligible by particular examples; If you diſſolve Copper in Aqua Fortis, or Spirit of Nitre, (for I remember not which Ius'd, nor do Ithink it much Material) You may by Cryſtalizing the Solution Obtain a goodly Vitriol; which though by Virtue of the Compoſition it have maniſfeſtly diverſe Qualities, not to be met with in either of the Ingredients, yet it ſeems that the Nitrous Spirits, or at leaſt many of them, may in this Compounded Maſs retain their former Nature; for having for tryal ſake Diſtill'd this Vitrioll Spirit, there came over ſtore of Red Fumes, which by that Colour, by their peculiar ſtinke, and by their Sourneſs, manifeſted themſelves to be, Nitrous Spirits; and that I ſuppoſe youl eaſily beleeve. But if ou diſſolve Minium, whichis but Lead bouder d by the Fire, in good Spirit of Vinager, and Cryſtalize the Solution, you ſhall not only have a Saccharine Salt exceedingly differing ſrom both its Ingredients; but the Union of ſome Parts of the Menſtruum with ſome of thoſe of the Metal is ſo ſtrict, that the Spirit of Vinager ſeems to be, as ſuch, deſtroyd, ſince the Saline Corpuſcles have quite loſt that acidity, upon whoſe Account the Liquor was calld Spirit of Vinager; nor can any ſuch Acid Parts as were put to the Minium be Separated by any known way from the Saæcharum Saturni reſulting ſfrom them both; for not only there is no Sowrneſs at all, but an admirable Sweetneſs to be taſted in the Concretion; and not only I found not that Spirit of Wine, which otherwiſe will immediately hiſs when mingſd with ſtrong Spirit of Vinager, would hiſs being pourd upon Saccharum Saturni, wherein yet the Acid Salt of Vinager, did it Survive, may ſeem to be concentrated; but upon the Diſtillation of Saccharum Saturni by its netrant; but not at all Acid, and differing as well in ſmell and other Qualities, as in taſt, from the Spirit o? Vinager; which likewiſe ſeemd to have leſt ſome of its Parts very firmly united to the Caput Mortuum, which though of a Leaden Nature was in ſmell, Colour, &c. differing from Minium 3 which brings into my mind, that though two Powders, the one Blew, and the other Yellow, may appear a Green mixture, without either of them loſing its own Colour, as a good Microſcope has ſometimes informd me; yet having mingid Minium and Sal Armoniack in a requifite Proportion, and exposd them in a Glaſs Veſſel to the Fire, the whole Maſs became White, and the Red Corpuſcles were deſtropd; ſor though the Calcin'd Lead was ſeparable from the Salt, yet youl eaſily beleeve it did not part from it in the Forme of a Red Powder, ſuch as was the Minium, when it was put to the Sal Armoniach. Ileave it alſo to be conſider'd, whether in Blood, and divers other Bodies, it be probable, that each of the Corpuſcles that concurr to make a Compound Body doth, though ſome of them in ſome Caſes may, retain its own Nature in it, ſo that Chymſts may Extricate cach ſort of them from all the others, wherewith it concurrd to make a Body of one Denomination. I know there may be a Diſtinction betwixt Matter Immanent, when the material Parts remain and retain their own Nature in the things materiated, as ſome of the Schoolmen ſpeak, (in which ſence Woodq, Stones and Lime are the matter of a Houſe, )and Tranſient,which in the materiated thing is ſo alter'd, as to receive a new Forme, without being capable of re-admitting again the Ol. In which ſence the Friends of this Diſtinction ſay, that Clyle is the matter of Blood, and Blood that of a Humane Body, of all whoſe Partstis preſumd to be the Aliment. I know alſo that it may be ſaid, that of material Principles, ſome are common to all mixt Bodies, as Aristotles four Elements, or the Chymiſts Tria Prima; others Peculiar, which belong to this or that ſort of Bodies; as Butter and a kind of whey may be ſaid to be the Proper Principles of Cream: and I deny not, bur that theſc Diſlinctions may in ſome Caſes be of Uſe; but partly by what I have ſaid already, and partly by what I am to ſay, You may eaſily enough gueſs in what ſence I admit them, and diſcerne that in ſuch a ſence they will eĩther illuſtrate ſome of my Opinions, or at leaſt will not overthrow any of them. To proſecute then what I was ſaying beſore, Iwill add to this purpoſe, That ſince the Major part of Chymiſts Credit, what thoſe they call Philoſophers aſfirme of their Stone, I may repreſent to them, that though when Common Gold and Lead are mingled Together, the Lead may be ſever d almoſt un-alterd from the Gold; yet if inſtead of Gold a Tanillum of the Red Elixir be mingled with the Saturn, their Union will be ſo indiſſoluble in the perfect Gold that will be producd by it, that there is no known, nor perhaps no poſſible way of ſeparating the diffusd Elixir from the fixed Lead, but they both Conſtitute a moſt permanent Body, wherein the Saturne ſeems to have quite loſt its Properties that made it be call'ld Lead, and to have been rather tranſmuted by the Elixir, then barely aſſociated wayes neceſſary, that the Bodies that are put together per minima, ſhould each retain its own Nature; So as when the Maſs it Selfis diſſipated by the Fire, to be more diſpos'd to re- appear in its Priſtine Forme, then in any new one, which by a ſtricter aſſociation of its Parts with thoſe ofjſome of the other Ingredients of the Compoſitum, then with one another, it may have acquired. And if ĩt be objected, that unleſs the Hypotheſis I oppoſe be admitted, in ſuch Caſes as Ihave propoſed there would not be an Union but a Deſtruction of mingled Bodies, which ſeems all one as to ſay, that of ſuch Bodies there is no miſtion at all; Ianſwer, that though the Subſtances that are mingſd remain, only their Accidents are Deſtroyd, and though we may with tollerable Congruity call them Miſiibilia, becauſe they are Diſtinct Bodies before they are put together, however aſterwards they are ſo Confounded that I ſhould rather call them Concretions, or Reſulting Bodies, than mixt ones; and thosgh, perhaps, ſome other and better Account may be proposd, upon which the name (160) oſ miſiion may remain; yet if what I have ſaid be thought Reaſon, l ſhall not wrangle about Words, though I think it ſitter to alter a Terme of Art, then reject a new Truth, becauſe it ſuits not vithit. If it be allo Objected that this Notion of mine, concerning mixtion, thoughit may be allowd, when Bodies already Compounded are put to be mingd, yet itis not applicable to thoſe mixtions that are immediately made of the Elements, or Principles themſelves; I Anſwer in the firſt place, that I here Conſider the Nature of mixtion ſomewhat more Generally, then the Chymiſts, who yet cannot deny that there are oftentimes Mixuures, and thoſe very durable ones, made of Bodies that are not Elementary. And in the next place, that though it maybe probably pretended that in thoſe Mixtures that are made immediately of the Bodies that are call'd Principles or Elements, the mingſd Ingredients may better retain their own Nature in the Compounded Maſs, and be more eaſily ſeparated from thence; yet, beſides that it maybe doubted, whether there be any ſuch Primary Bodies, Iſee not why the reaſon I alleadę'd, of the deſtructibility of the Ingredients of Bodies in General, may not ſometimes be Applicable to Salt Sulphur or Mercury; till it be ſhewn upon what account we are to believe them Priviledgedl. And however, (if you pleaſe but to recall to mind, to what purpoſe I told you at Firſt, Imeant to ſpeak of Miſtion at this Time) you will perhaps allow that what Ihave hitherio Diſcourſed about it may not only give ſome Light to the Naure of it in general (eſpecially when I ſhall have an Opportunity to Declare to Jou my thoughts on that ſubject more fully) but may on ſome Occaſions alſo be Serviccable to me in the Inſuing Part of this Diſcourſc. But, to look back Now to that part of our Diſcourſe, whence this Excurſion concerning Miſtion has ſo long diverted us, though we there Deduca, ſrom the differing Subſtances obtained from a Plant nouriſhed only with Water, and from ſome other things, that it was not neceſſary that nature ſhould alwaies compound a Body at firſt of all ſuch difering bodies as the fire could afterwards make it afford3 yet this is not all that may be collected from thoſe ExperiM ments. For ſrom them there ſeems alſo Deducible ſomething that Subverts an other Foundation of the Chymical Doctrine. For ſince that Cas we have ſten) out of fair Water alone, not onl Spirit, but Oyle, and Salt, and Eorih may be Produced3 It will follow that Salt and Sulphur are not Primogeneal Bodies, and principles, ſince they are every Day made out oſ plain Water by the Texture which the Sced or Seminal principle oſ plants puts it into. And this would not perhaps ſcem ſo ſtrange, if through pride, or negligence, We were not Wont to Overlook the Obvious and Familiar Workings of Nature; For if We conſider what ſlight Qualities they are that ſcrve to denominate one of the Tria Prima, We ſhall find that Nature dos frequently enough work as great Alterations in divers parcells of matter: For to be readily diſſoluble in water, is enough to make the body that is ſo, paſſe fora Salr. And yer I ſee not. Why from a new ſhufling and Diſpoſition of. the Component Particles of a body, it ſhould be much harder for Nature to compoſe a body diſſoluble in Water, of a portion of Water that was not ſo before, then of the Liquid ſubſtance of an Egę, which will eaſily mx with Vater, to produce by the bare warmth ofa hatching Hen, Membrans, Feathers, Tendons, and other parts, that are not diſſoluble in VVater as that Liquid Subſtance was: Nor is the Hardneſs and Brittleneſs of Salt more difficult for Nature to introduce into ſucha yielding body as VVater, then it is for her to make the Bones of a Chick out of the tender Subſtance of the Liquors of an Egę. But inſtead ol proſecuting this conſideration, as Ieaſily might, Iwill procced, as ſoon as I have taken notice of an objection that lies in my Way. ForI caſily foreſce it will be alledged, that the above mentioned Examples are all taken from Plants, and Animals, in whom the Matter is Faſhioned by the Plaſtick power of the ſeed, or ſomething analoouS thereuntoo. Whereas the Fire os not act like any o? the Seminal Principles, but deſtroyes them all, hen they come within its Reach. But to this Iſnall need at preſent to make but this eaſy Anſwer, That whether it be a Seminal Principle, or any other which faſhions that Matter aſter thoſe various manncrs I have mentioned to You, yet tis Evident, that either by the Plaſtick principle Alone, or that and Heat Together, or by ſome Other cauſe capable to contex the matter, ĩt is yet poſſible that the matter may be Anew contrivd into ſuch Bodies. Andtis only for the Poſſibility of this that I am now contending. The THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Third Part. Hat I have hitherto Diſcoursd, Eleutherius, ( ſayes his Friend to Him) has, Ipreſume, ſiewn You, that a Conſidering Man may very well queſtion the Truth of thoſe very Suppoſitions which Chymiſts as well as Peripateticks, without proving, take for granted; and upon which Depends the Validity of the Inferences they draw from theit Experiments. Wherefore having diſpach't that, which though a Chymiſt Perhaps will not, yet I do, look upon as the moſt Important, as well as Difſficult, part of my Task, it will now be Seaſonable for me to proli ceed to the Conſideration of the Experiments themſelves, wherein they are wont ſo much to Triumph and Glory. And theſe will the rather deſerve a ſerious Examination, becauſe thoſe that Alledge them are wont to do it with ſo much Confidence and Oſtentation, that they have hitherto imposd upon almoſt all Perſons, without excepting Philoſophers and Phyſitians thomſelves, who have read theit Books, or heard them talk, For ſome learned Men have been content rather to beleeve what they ſo boldly Affirm, then be at the trouble and charge, to try whether or noĩt be True. Others again, who have Curioſity enough to Examine the Truth of what is Averrd, want Skill and Opporunity to do what they Deſire. And the Generality even of Learned Men, ſecing the Chymiſis (not contenting themſelves with the Schools to amuſe the World with empty words) Actually Performd divers ſtrange things, and, among thoſe Reſolve Compound Bodies into ſeveral Subſtances not known by former Philoſophers 1o0 be containd in them: Men Iſay, ſccing theſe Things, and Hearing with what Confidence Chymiſts Averr the Subſtances Obtaind ſrom Compound Bodies by the Fire to be the True Elements, or, (as they ſpeak) Hypoſtaticall Principles of them, are forward to think it but Juſt as well as Modeſt, that according to the Logicians Rule, the Scilſull Artifts ſhould be Credited in their own Art; Eſpecially when thoſe things whoſe Nature they ſo Confidently take upon them to teach others are not only Productions of their own Skill, but ſuch as others Know not elſe what to make of, But thHough (Continues Carneades) the Chymiſts have been able upon ſome or other of the mentiond Acounts, not only to Delight but Amaze, and almoſt to bewitch cven Learned Men; yet ſuch as You and I, who are nor unpractis'd in the Trade, muſt not ſuſfer our Selves to be imposd upon by hard Names, or bold Aſſertions;nor to bę daæd by that Light which ſhould but aſſift us to diſcern things the more clearly. It is one thing to be able to help Nature t6 produce things, and another thing to. Underſtand well the Nature oſ the things producd. As we ſee, that many Perſons that can beget Children, are for all that as Ignorant of the Number and Nature of the parts, eſpecially the interpal ones, that Conſtitute a Childs Body, as they that never were Parents. Nor do I Doubt, but you'l excuſe me, if as Ithank the Chymiſts for the things their Analyſis ſncws me, ſo I take the Liberty to conſider how many, and what they are, without being aſtoniſid at them; as if, whoſoever hath Skill enough to ſhew men ſome new thing of his own making, had the Right to make them believe whatſoever he pleaſes to tell them concerning it. Wrereſore I will now proceed tę my Third General Conſideration, whichiis, That it docs not appear, that Three is precilely and Univerſally the Number of the Diſtinct Subſtances or Elements, whercinto mixt Bodies are reſoluble by the Fire3 I mean that tis not provd by Chymiſts, that all the Compound Bodies, which are granted 10 be perſectly mixt, are upon their Chymical Analyſis diviſible each of them ther more nor leſs, which are wont to be lookt upon as Elementary, or may as well be reputed ſo as thoſe that are ſo reputed. Wihich laſt Clauſe I ſubjoyne, to prevent your Objecting, that ſome of the Subſtances I may have occaſion to mention by and by, are not perfectly Homogeneous, nor Conſequently worthy of the name of Principles. For that which Iam now to conſider, is, into how many Differing Subſtances, that may plauſioly paſs for the Elementary Ingredients of a mixd Dody, it may be Analyæ'd by the Fire3; but whether each of theſe be un- compounded, Ireſerve to examine, when ſhall come to the next General Conſideration; where I hope to evince, that the Subſtances which the Chymiſts not only allow, but aſſert to be the Component Principles of the Body reſolvd into them, are not wont to be uncom-. pounded, Now there are two Kind of Arguments (purſues Carneades) which may be brought to make my Third Propoſition ſeem probable; one ſort of them being of a more Speculative Nature, rience. To begin then with the firſt of theſe. But as Carneades was going to do as he had ſaid, Eleutherius interrupted him, by ſaying with a ſomewhat ſmiling countenance; If you have no mind I ſhould think, that the Proverb, That Good wits have bcd Memories, is Rational and Applicable to You, You muſt not Forget now you are upon the Speculative onſiderations, that may relate to the Number oſ the Elements; that your Self did not long ſince Deliver and Concede ſome Propoſitions in Favour of the Chymical Doctrine, which I may withour diſparagement to you think it uneaſe, even for Carneades to anſwer. I have not, replies he, Forgot the Conceſſions you mean3 but I hope too, that you have not forgot neither with what Cautions they were made, when I had not vet aſſumed the Perſon I am now ſuſtaining. But however, I ſhall to content You, ſo diſcourſe of my Third general conſideration, as to let You ſee, That I am not Unmindful of the things you would have me remember. To talk then again according to ſuch priuciples as I then made uſe of, Iſhall repreſent, that if it be granted rational to ſuppoſe, as Ithen did, that the Elements conſiſted at firſt of certain ſmall and primary Coalitions of the minute Particles oſmatter into Corpuſcles very numerous, and very like each other, It will not be abſurd to conceive, that ſuch primary Cluſters may be of far more ſorts then three or five; and conſequently, that we need not ſuppoſe, that in cach of the compound Bodies we are treating of there ſhould be found juſt three ſorts of ſuch primitive Coalitions, as we are ſpeaking of. And if according to this Notion we allow a conſiderable number of differing Elements, I may add, that it ſeems very poſſible, that to the conſtitution of one ſort of mixt Bodies two kinds of Elementary ones may ſuffice (as I lately Exempliſy’d to you, in that moſt durable Concrete, Glaſs,) another ſort of Mixts maybe compos'd of three Elements, another of four, another of five, and another perhaps of many more. So that according to this Notion, there can be no determinate number aſfignd, as that of the Elements, oſ all ſorts of compound Bodies whatſoever, it being very probable that ſome Concretes conſiſt of fewer, ſome of more Elements. Nay, it does not ſeem Impoſſible, according to theſe Principles, but that there may be two ſorts of Mixts, whereof the one may not have any of all the ſame Elements as the other conſiſtsof; as we oftentimes ſee two words, whereoſ the one has not any one of the Letters to be met with in the other; or as we often meet with diverſe Electuaries, in which no Ingredient ( excep: Sugar) is common to any two of them. I will not here debate whether there may not be a multitude of theſe Corpuſcles, which by reaſon of their being primary and ſimple, might be called Elementary, if ſeveral ſorts of them ſhould convene to compoſe any Body,which are as yet free, and neither as yet contex'd and entangl'd with primary Corpuſcles of orher kinds, but remains liable to be ſubdd and faſhiond by Seminal Principles, or the like powerful and Tranſmuting Agent, by whom they may be ſo connected among themſelves, or with the parts of pound Bodies, whoſe Ingredients they are, reſoluble into more, or other Elements then thoſe that Chymiſts have hitherto taken notice of. To all which Imay add, that ſince it appears, by what Iobſerv'd to you of the permanency of Gold and Silver, that even Corpuſcles that are not of an Elementary but compounded Nature, may be of ſo durable a Texture, as to remain indiſſol ble in the ordinaty Analyſis that Chymiſts make of Bodies by the Fire Tis not impoſſible but chat, though there were but three Elements, yet there may be a greater number of Bodies, which the wonted wayes of Anatomy will not diſcover to be no Elementary Bodies. But, ſayes Carneades, having thus far, in compliance to you, talkt conjecturally of the number of the Elements,tis now time to conſider, not of how many Elements it is poſſible that Nature ma compound mix'd Bodies, but (at lea as farr as the ordinary Experiments of Chymiſts will informe us) of how many ſhe doth make them up. I ſay chen, that it does not by theſe ſuſficiently appear to me, that ihere is any one determinate number of Elements to be uniformly met with in all the ſeveral ſorts of Bodies allow'd tobe perſectly mixt. And for the more diſtinct proof of this Propoſition, Iſhall in the firſt place Repreſent, That there are divers Bodies, whichI could never ſee by fire divided into ſo many as three Elementary ſubſtances. Iwouſd fain(as I ſaid lately to Philoponus) ſee that fixt and noble Metal we call Gold ſeparated into Salt, Sulphur and Mercury: and if any man will ſubmit to a competent forſeiture in caſe of failing, I ſall willingly incaſe of proſperous ſucceſſe pay both tor the Materials and the charges of ſuch an Experiment. Tis not, that aſter what I have try'd my ſelf I dare peremptorily deny, that there may out of Gold be extracted a certain ſubſtance, whichI cannot hinder Chymiſts from calling its Tincture or Sulphur; and which leaves the remaining Body deprivd of its onted colour. Nor am I ſure, that there cannot be drawn out of the ſame Metal a real quick and running Mercurv. But for the Salt of Gold, I never could either ſee it, or be ſatisfied ted, in rerum natura, by the relation of any credible eye witneſſe. And for the ſeveral Proceſſes that Promiſe that effect, the materials that muſt be wrought upon are ſomewhat too pretious and coſtly to be waſted upon ſo groundleſſe adventures, of which not only the ſucceſſe is doubtſul, but the very poſſibility is not yet demonſtrated. Yet that which moſt deterres me from ſuch tryalls, is not their chargeableneſſe, but their unſatisfactorine ſſe, though they ſhould ſucceed. For the Extraction of this golden Salt being in Chymiſts Proceſſes preſcribed to be effected by corroſive Menſtruums, or the Intervention of other Saline Bodies, it will remain doubtſul to a wary perſon, whether the Emergent Salt be that of the Gold it ſelf; or of the Saline Bodies or Spirits employd to prepare it3 For that ſuch diſguiſes of Metals do often impoſe upon Artiſts, I am ſure Eleutherius is not ſo much a ſtranger to Chymiſtry as to ignore. I would likewiſe willingly ſee the three principles ſeparated ſrom the pure ſort of VirginSand, from Oſteocolla, trom refined Silver, from Quickſilver, freed ſrom its adventitious Sulphur, ſrom Venetian Talk, which by long detention in an extreme Reverberium, I could but divide into ſmaller Particles, (not the conſtituent principles,) Nay, which, when I cauſed it to be kept, I know not how long, in a Glaſſe- houſe fire, came out in the Figure i's Lumps had when put in, though alter'd to an almoſt Amethyſtine colour3 and from divers other Bodtes. which ĩt were now unneceſſary to enumerate. For though Idare not abſolutely aſfirme it to be impoſſible to Analyze theſe Bodies into theit Tria Prima; yet becauſe, neither my own Experiments, nor any competent Teſtimony. hath l i-herto either taught me how ſuch an Analyſisma be made, or ſatisſy’d me, that it hat been ſo, Imuſt take the Liberty to reſrain ſrom believing it, till the Chymiſts prove it, or give us intelligible and practicable Proceſſes to performe what they pretend. For whilſt they affect that ænigma ical obſcurity with which they are wont topuæzle the Readers of their divulgd Proceſſes concerning the Analyticall Preparation of Gold or Mercury, they leave wary perſons much unſatisſyed whether or no the differing Subſtances, they promiſe to produce, be iroly the Hypoſtatical Principles, or only ſome intermixtures of the divided Bodics with thoſe cmployd to work upon them, as is Evident in the ſcoming Cryſtalls of Silver, and thoſe of Mercury 3 which though by ſome inconſiderately ſuppoſed to be the Salts of thoſe Metalls, are plainly but mixtures of the Metalline Bodies, with the Saline paris of Aqua fortis or other corroſive Liquors; as is evident by their being reducible into Silver orQuickſilver, as they were before. I cannot but Confeſſe (ſaith Eleutherius) that though Chymiſts may upon probable grounds afſirm themſelves Able to obtain their Tvia Prima, from Animals and Vegetables, yet I have often wondred that they ſhould ſo confidently pretend alſo to reſolve all Metalline and other Mineral bodies into salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. For tis a ſaying almoſt Proverbial, among thoſe Chymiſts themſelves that are accounted Philoſophers; and our famous Countryman Roger Bacon has particularly adoptedit; that Facilius est aurum facere quam deſtruere. And fear, with You, that Gold is not the onlyMineral from which Chymiſts arc wont ſruitleſly to attempt the ſeparating of their three Principles. I know indeed (continues E leutherius) that the Learned Sennertus, even ĩin that book where he takes not upon him to play the Advocate for the Chymiſts, but the Umpier betwixt them and the Peripãteticks, expreſſes himſelfroundly, thus; Salemomnibus ineſſe (mixtis ſcilicet) & ex iis fieri peſſe onnibus in reſolutionibus Chymicis verſatis notiſſimum est. And in the next Page, Quod de ſale dixi, ſaies he, Idem dẽ Sulphure dici potest: but by his favour ſmuſt ſce very good proofs, before I believelſuch general Aſſertions, how boldly ſocver made; ànd he that would convince me of their truth, muſt firſt tcach me ſome true and practicable way of ſeparating Salt and Sulphur from Gold, silver, and thoſe many different ſort of Stones, that a violent Fire does not bring to Lime, but to Fuſion; and not only I, for my own part, never ſaw any of thoſe newly nam?d Bodies ſo reſolved 3 but Helmont, who was much better vers'd in the Chymical Anatomizing of Bodies theneither Sennertus or I, has ſomewhere this reſolute paſſage; Scio (ſaies he)ex arena, ſilitibus & ſuxir, vium trahi poſſe ; Nay Quercetanus himſclf, though the grand ſtickler for the Tria Prima, has this Conſeſſion of the Irreſolubleneſs of Diamonds 3 Adamas (ſaith he) omnium fatius Lapidum ſolidiſſimus ac duri ſomus ex arctiſſima videlicet trium principiorum unione ac Cohærentia, quæ nulla arte ſeparationis in ſolutiorem principiorum ſuorum ſpiritualium diſjungi poteſt. And Indeed, purſues Eleatheriu, Iwas not only glad, but ſomewhat ſurprized to find you inclined to Admit that there maybe a sulphur and a runnin Mercury drawn ſrom Gold; for unle ſi you do (as your expreſſion ſeemd to intimate) take the word Sulphur in a very looſe ſence, I muſt doubt whether our Chymiſts can, ſeparate a Sulphur from Gold: For when Iſaw you make the experiment that Iſuppoſe invited you to ſpeak as you did, Idid not judge the golden Tincture to be the true principle of Sulphur extracted from the body, tut an aggregate of ſome ſuch highly colourd arts of the Gold, asa Chymiſt would 1ave called a Sulphur ircombuſlible, which in plain Engliſh ſeems to be little better than to call ĩt a Sulphur and no Sulphur. And as for Metalline Mercuries, I had not wondred at it, though you had expreſſed much more ſeverity in ſpeaking of them: For I remember that having once met an old and famous Aruſt, who had ]ong been (and ſtill is) Chymiſt  a great Monarch, the repute he had of a very honeſt man invited me to. deſire him to tell me ingenuouſly whether or no, among his many labours, he had ever really extracted a true and running Mercu& out of Metalls 3 to which queſtion he reely replycd, that he had never ſeparated a true Mercury ſrom any Metal; nor had ever ſeen it really done by any man elſe. And though Gold is, of all Metalls, That, hoſe Mercury Chymiſts have moſt endeavoured to extract, and which they do the moſt brag they have extracted; yet the Experiencod Angels Sala, in his Spagyrical account of the'ſeven Terreſtrial Planets (that is the ſcven metalls) affords us this memorable Teſtimony, to our preſent purpoſe; Quanquam ( ſaies he) &c. experientia tamen (quam fſtultorum Magiſtrum vocamus) certe Comprobavit, Mercarium auri adeo fixum, maturum;& arcte cum reliquis ejuſdem corporis ſubſtantiis conjungi, ut nullo modo retrogredi pſũt. To which he ſub- Joyies that he himſelſhad ſeen much Labour ſpent upon that Deſign, but could never ſec any ſuch Mercury producd thereby. And Ieaſily beleeve what he anncxes; that he had often ſeen Deteũted many tricks and Impostures of Cheatin Alchymiſts. For,the moſt part of thoſe that are fond of ſuch Charlatans, being unskilfull or Credulous, or both, tis very eaſie for ſuch as have ſome Skill, much craft, more boldneſs, and nmo Conſcience, to impoſe upon them; and therefore, though many profeſsd 4lehymists, and divers Perſons of Quality have rold me that they have made or cen the Mercury of Gold, or oſ this or that other Metal; yet I have been ſtillapt to fear that eĩther theſe perſons have had a Deſign to deceive others3 or have not hadskill and circumſpection enough to keep themſelves from being deceivedl. You recall to my mind (ſayes Carreades) a certain Experiment I once devis'd, innocently to deceive ſome perſons, and let them and others ſee how little is to be built upon the affirmation of thoſe that are either unsxillfull or unwary, when they tell us they have ſcen Alehymists make the Mercury of this or that Metal; and to make this the more evident, I made my Experiment much more Slight, Short and Simple, than the Chymiſis uſuall proccſſes to Extract Metalline Mercuries; which Operations being commonly more Elaborate and Intricate, and requiring a much more longer time, give the Alchymiſis a greater opportunity to Cozen, and Conſequently are more Obnoxious to the Spectators ſuſpicion. And that wherein I endeavourd to make my Experiment look the more like a True Analyſis, was, thatI not only pretended as well as others to extract a Mercury from the Metal I wrought upon, but likewiſe to ſeparate à large proportion of maniſeſt and inflamablè Sulphur. I take then, of the filings of Copper, about a Drachme or two, of common ſublimate, powderd, the like Weight, and Sal Armsniack near about as much as of Sublimate; theſe three being well mingl'd together I put into a ſmall Vial with a long neck, or, which I find better, into a Glaſs Urinall, which (having ſirſt ſtopped it with Cotton) to mo the Noxious Fumes, Iapproach by depreos to a competent Fire of well indled coals, or ( which looks better, but more endangers the Glaſs) to the Flame of a candle; and aſter a while the bottom of the Glaſs being held Juſt upon the Xindled Coals, or in the flame, You may in abour a quarter of an Hour, or perchance in halfe that time, perceive in the Bottom of the Glaſs ſome running Mercury; and if then You take away the Glaſs and break it, You ſhall find a Parcel of Quickſilver, Perhaps altogether, and perhaps part of it in the pores of the Solid Maſs; You ſhall find too, that the remaining Lump being held to the Flame of the Candle uit readily burn with a greeniſh Flame, and after a little while (perchance preſently) will in the Air Acquire a Greeniſh Blew, which being the Colour that is aſcribd to Copper, when its Body is unlocked, Tis eaſie to perſwade Men that this is the True Sulphur of Venus, eſpecially ſince not only the Salts may be Supposd partly to be Flown away, and partly to be Sublimd to the upper part of the Glaſs, whoſe inſide ( will Commonly appear Whitened by them) but the Metal ſeems to be quite Deſtroyd, the Copper no longer appearing in a Metalline Forme, but almoſt in that of a Reſinous Lump; whereas indeed the Caſe is only this, That the Saline parts of the Sublimate, together with the Sal Armoniack, being excited and actuated by the Vehement heat, fall upon the Copper, (Which is a Metal they can more eaſily corrode, than ſilver) whereby the ſmall parts of the Mercury Eeing ſrecd ſrom the Salts that kept them aſunder, and being by the heat tumbled up and down after many Occurſions, they Convene into a Conſpicuous Maſs of Liquor; and as for the Salts, ſome of the more Volatile of them Subliming to the upper part of the Glaſs, the others Corrode the Copper, and uniting themſelves with it do ſtrangely alter and Diſguiſe its Metallick Form, and compoſe with it a new kind of Concrete inflamable like Sulphur; concerning which I ſnall not no ſay any thing, ſince I can Referr You to the Diligent Obſervations which I remember Mr. Boyle has made concerning this Odde kind of Verdigreaſe. But Continues Carneades ſmiling, you know Iwas not cut out for a Mountebank, and therefore I will haſten to reſume the perſon of a Sceptick, and take up my diſcourſe where You diverted me from proſecuting it. In the next place, then, I conſider, that, as there are ſome Bodies which yield not ſo many as the three Principles; ſo there are many others, that in their Reſolution Exhibite more principles than three; and that therefore the Ternary Number is not that of the Univerſal and Adequate Principles of Bodies. If you allow of the Diſcourſe I ately made You, touchin the primary Aſſociations of the ſmal Particles of matter, You will ſcarce think it improbable, that of ſuch Elementary Corpuſcles there may be more ſorts then either three, or four, or five. And if you will grant, what will ſcarce be deny’d, that Corpuſcles of a compounded Nature may in all the wonted Examples of Chymiſts paſs for Elementary, Iſee not, why you ſnould think it impoſſible, that as Aqua Fortis, or Aqua Regis will make a Separation of colliquated Silver and Gold, though the gent found out ſo ſubtile and ſo powerfull, at leaſt in reſpect of thoſe particular compounded Corpuſcles, as to be able to reſolve them into thoſe more ſimple ones, whereof they conſiſt, and conſequently encreaſe the number of the Diſtinct Subſtances, whereinto the mixt Body has been hitherto thought reſoluble. And if that be true, whichI recited to you a while ago out of Helmont concerning the Operations of the Altahest, which divides Bodies into other Diſtinct Subſtances, both as to number and Nature, then the Fire doces; it will not a little countenance my Conjecture. But confining our ſclves to ſuch wayes of Analyzing mixd Bodies, as are alrcady not unknown to Chymiſts, it may without Abſurditybe Queſtion'd, whether beſides thoſe groſſer Elements of Bodies, which they call Salt Sulphur and Mercury, there may not be Ingredients of a more Subtile Nature, which being extreamly little, and not being in themſclves Viſible, may eſcape unhceded at the Junctures of the Deſtillatory Veſſels, though never ſo carefully Luted. For let me obſerve to you one thing, which though hot taken notice of by Chymiſts, may be a notion of good uſ in divers Caſes to à Naturaliſt, that we may well ſuſpect, that there may be ſeverall Sorts of Bodies, which are not Immediate Objects of any one of our ſenſes; ſince we See, that not only thoſe little Corpuſcles that iſſue out of the Loadſtone, and perform the Wonders for which it is juſtly admired; Bur the Effiuviums of Amber, Jet, and other Electricall Concretes, though by their effeqts upon the particular Bodies diſpos'd to receive their Action, they ſeem to fall under the gnizance of our Sight, yet do they not as Electrical immediãtely' Afect any of our ſenſes, as do the bodiĩes, whether minute or greater, that we See, Feel, Taſte, &c. But, continues Carneades, becauſe you may expect I ſhould, as the Chymiſts do, conſider only the ſenſible Ingredients of Mixt Bodics, let us now ſee, what Experience will, even as to theſe, ſuggeſt to us. It ſcems then queſtionable enough, Whether from Grapes variouſly orderd there may not be drawn more diſtinẽt Subſtances by the help of the Fire, then from moſt other mixt Bodies. For the Grapes themſelves being dryed into Rayſins and diſtill'd, will (beſides Alcali, Phlegm, and Earth) yield a conſiderable quantity of an Empyreumatical Oyle, and a Spirit of a very different nature from that o? Wine. Alſo the unfermented Juice of Grapes affords other diſtiPd Liquors then Wine doth. The Juice of Grapes after fermentation will yvield a Spiritus Ardens ; hich if competently rectifyed will all burn away without leaving any thing remaining. The ſame fermented Juice degenerating into Vinager, yields an acid and corroding Spirit. The ſame Juice turn'd up, armes it ſelf with Tartar; out of which may be ſeparated, as out of other Bodies, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and Earth: not to mention what Subſtances may be drawn from the Vine it ſelf, probably differing ſrom thoſe which are ſeparated from Tartar, which isa body by it ſclf, that has few reſemblers in the World. And I will further conſider that what force ſoever you will allow this inſtance, to evince that there are ſome Bodies that vield more Elements then others, it can ſcarce be denyd but that the Major part ments, yield more then three. For,beſides thoſe which the Chymiſts are pleaſed to name Hypoſtatical, moſt bodies contain two others, Phlegme and Earth, which concurring as well as the reſt to the conſtitution of Mixts, and being as generally, if not more, found in their Analyſis, I ſee no ſufficient cauſe why they ſhould be excluded from the number of Elements. Nor will it ſuffice to object, as the Paracelſians are wont to do, that the Tria prima are the moſt uſeful Elements, and the Earth and Water but worthleſſe and unactive; ſor Elements being calld ſo in relation to the conſtituting of mixt Bodies, it ſould be upon the account of ĩts Ingrediency, not of its uſe, that any thing ſhould be affirmed or denyed to be an Element: and as for the pretended uſeleſsneſs of Earth and Water, it would be conſiderd that uſefulneſſe, or the want of it, denotes only a Reſpect or Relation to us; and therefore the preſence, or abſence of it, alters not the Intrinſick nature of the thing. The hurtſul Teeth of Vipers are for ought I know uſeleſs to us, and yet are not to be denyd to be parts of their Bodies 3 and it were hard to ſhes of what greater Uſe to Us, then Phlegme and Earth, are thoſe Undiſcernd Stars, which our New Teleſcopes diſcover to Us, in many Blanched places of the Sky; and yet we cannot but acknowledge them Conſtituent andConſiderably great parts of the Univerſe. Beſides that whether or no the Phlegme and Earth be immediately Uſeful, but neceſſary to conſtitute the Body whence they are ſeparated; and conſequently, if the mixt Body be not Uſeleſs to us, thoſe conſtituent parts, without which it could not have been That mixt Body, may be ſaid not to be Unuſeful to Us: and thoughthe Earth and Water be not ſo conſpicuouſly Operative ( after ſeparation) as the other three more active Principles, yet in this caſe it will not be amiſs to remember the luckyFable of enemius Agrippa, of the dangerous Sedition of the Hands and Legs, and other more buſie parts of the Body, againſt the ſeemingly unactive Stomack. And to this caſe alſo we may not unſitly apply that Reaſoning of an Apoſtle, to another purpoſe3 If the Ear ſball ſay, becauſe I am not the Eye, I am not of the Body ; Is it therefore not of the Body? If the whole Bodymere Eye, where were the Heorigg? If the whole were for hearing, where the ſmelling? In a word, ſince Earth and water appear, asclearly and as generally as the other Principles upon the reſolution of Bodies, to be the Ingredients whereof they are made up3 and fince they are uſeful, if nor immediately to us, or rather to Phyſitians, to the Bodies they conſtitute, and ſo though in ſomewhat a remoter way, are ſerviceable to us;to exclude them out of the number of Elements, is not to imitate Nature. But, purſues Carneades, though I think it Evident, that Earth and Phlegme are to be reckon'd among the Elements of moſt Animal and Vegetable Bodies, yettis not upon that Account alone, that I think divers Bodies reſoluble into more Subſtances then three. For there are two Experiments, that I have ſometimes made to ſhew, that at leaſt ſome Mixts are diviſible into more Diſtinct Subſtances then five. The one of theſe Experiments, thoughtwill be more ſeaſonable for me to mention it fullv anon, yet in the mean time, Iſhall tell you thus much of it, That out of two Diſtillld Liquors, which paſs for Elements of the Bodies whence they are drawn, I can without Addition make a true Yellow and Inflamable Sulphur, notwithſtanding that the two Liquors remain aſterwards Diſtinct. Of the other Experiment, which perhaps will not be altogether unworthy your Notice, I muſt now give you this particular Account. Ihad long obſerv'd, that by the Deſtillation of divers Woods, both in Ordinary, and ſome unuſuall ſorts of Veſſels, the Copious Spirit that came over, had beſides a ſtrong taſt, to be met with in the Empyreumaticall Spirits of many other Bodies, an Acidity almoſt like that of Vinager: Wherefore I ſuſpected, that though the ſowriſh Liquor Diſtill'd, for Inſtance, ſrom Box- Wood, be lookt upon by Chymiſts as barely the Spirit of it, and therefore as one ſingle Element or Principle; yet it does really conſiſt of two Diſfering Subſtances, and may be diviſible into them; and conſequently, that ſuch Woods and other Mixts as abound with ſuch a Vinager, may be ſaid to conſiſt of one Element or Principle, more then the Chymiſts as yet my ſelf, how the ſeparation of theſe two Spirits might be made, I Quickly found, that there were ſeveral wayes o Compaſſing it. But that of them which I ſhall at preſent mention, vas this, Having Deſtill'd a Quintisy of Box-Wood ſer ſe, and ſlowly rectifyd the ſowriſh Spirit, the better to ſree it both from Oyle and Phlegme, Icaſt into this Rectity.d Liquor a convenient Quantity of Powderd Coral, expecting that the Acid part of the Liquor would Corrode the Coral, and being aſſociated with it would be ſo retaid by it, that the other part of the Liquor, which was not of an acid Nature, nor fit to faſten upon the Corals, would be permitted to aſcend alone. Nor was I deceivd in my Expectation; For having gently abſtracted the Liquor from the Coralls, there came over a Spirit of a Strong ſmell, and of a taſt very piercing, but without any ſourneſs; and which was in diverſe qualities maniſeſtly different, not only from a Spirit of Vinager, but from ſome Spirit of the ſame Wood, that purpoſely kept by me without depriving it of its acid Ingredient. And to ſatisty you, that thel? two Subſtances were of a very differing Nature, I might informe youòf ſeveral Tryals that I made, but muſt not name ſome of them, becauſe I cannot do ſo without making ſome unſeaſonable diſcoveries. Yet this I ſhall tell you at preſent, that the ſowre Spirit of Eox, not only would, as I juſt now related, diſſolve Corals, which the other would not faſten on, but being pour d upon Salt of Tartar would immediatelv boile and hiſs, whereas the other oud lye quietly upon it. The acid Spirit pourd upon Ainium made a Sugar of Lead, which Idid not find the other to do; ſome drops of this penetrant ſpirit being mingſd with ſome drops of the blew Syrup of Violets ſeemd rather to dilute then otherwiſe alter the colour; whereas the Acid Spirit turn'd the ſyrup of a reddiſh colour, and would probably have made it of as pure a red as Acid Salts are wont to do, had not its operation been hindered by the mixture of the other Spirit. Afew drops of the compound Spirit being Shaken into a pretty quantity of the infuſion of Lignum Nephriticum, preſently deſtroyed all the blewiſh colour, whereas the other Spirit would nos take it avay. To all which it might be added, that having for tryals ſake pourd fair water upon the Corals that remained in the bottom of the glaſs wherein I had rectifyed the double ſpirit Cif I may ſocall it) that was ſirſt drawn ſrom the Box, Iſound according to my expectation that the Acid Spirit had really diſſolved the Corals, and had coagulated ith them. For by the affuſion of fair Water, IObtaind a Solution, which (to note that ſingularity upon thebye) was red, whence the Water being evaporated, there remained a ſoluble Subſtance much like the Ordinary Salt of Coral, as Chymiſts are pleas'd to call that Magiſtery of Corals, which they make by diſſolving them in common ſpirit of Vinager, and abſtracting the Menſtruum ad Siccitatem. I know not whether I ſhould ſubjoine, on this occaſion, that the ſimple ſpirit of Box, if Chymiſts will have it therefore Saline becauſe it has a ſtrong taſt, will furniſh ns with a new kind of Saline Bodies, differing ſfrom thoſe hitherto taken notice of. For whereas of the three chief ſoris of salits, the Acid, the Alcalizate, and the Sulphureous, there is none that ſcems to be friends with borh the other two, as Imay,ere it be long, have occaſion to ſew; Idid not find but that the ſimple ſpirit of Box did agree very well (at leaſt as farr as I had occaſion to try it) both with the Acid and the other Salis. For though it would lye very quiet with ſalt of Tartar, Spirit of Urine, or other bodies, whoſe salts were either of an Alcalizate or fugitive Nature;3 vet did not the mingling of Oyle of Vitriol it ſelf produce any hiſſing orEfferveſcence, which you know is wont to enſue upon the Aftuſion of that highly Acid Liquor upon eit her oſthe Bodies newly mentioned. I think my ſelf, ſayes Eleutheriu, beholden to you, for this Experiment; not only becauſe I forſee you will make it helpful to you in the Enquiry you are now upon, but becauſe ĩt teaches us a Method, whereby we may prepare a numerous ſort of new ſpirits, which though more ſimple then any that are thought Elementary, are maniſfeſtly endowd with peculiar and powerſull qualities, lome of which may probably be of conſiderable uſe in Phyſick, as well alone, as aſſociated with other things; as one may hopeſully guels by the redneſs of that Solution your ſour Spirit made of Corals, and by ſome other circumſtances of your Narrative. And ſuppoſe (purſues Eleutherius) that you are nor ſo confin'd, for the ſeparation of the Acid parts of theſe compound Spirits from the other, to employ Corals; but that you may as well make uſe of any Alcalizate Salt, or of Pearls, or Crabs eyes, or any other Body, upon which common Spirit of Vinager will eaſily work, and, to ſpeak in an Helmontian Phrale, Exantlate it ſelf. I have not yet tryed, ſayes Carneades, of whatuſe the mentiond liquors may be in Phyſick,either as Medicines or as Aexstruums : But I could mention now (and may another time) divers o? the tryals that I made to ſatisfy my ſelf of the difſerence of theſe two Liquors. But that, as Iallow your thinking what you newly told me about Corals, Ipreſume you will allow me, from what Ihave ſaid already, to deduce this Corollary; That there are divers compound bodies, which may be reſolvd into four ſuch differing Subſtances, as may as well merit the name of Principles, as thoſe to which the Chymiſts freely give it. For ſince they ſcruple not to reckon that which I callthe compound Spirit of Box, for the ſpirit, or as others would have it, the Mercury of that Wood, I ſee nor, why the Acid liuor, and the other, ſhould not each of them, eſpecially that laſt nameò, be lookt upon as more worthy to be called an Elementary Principle; ſince it muſt needs be of a more ſimple nature then the Liquor, which was found to be diviſible into that, and the Acid Spirit. And this further uſe (continues Carneades) may be made of our experiment to my preſent purpoſe, that it may give us a riſe to ſuſpect, that ſince a Liquor reputed by the Chymiſts to be, without diſpute, Homogencous, is by ſo ſlight a way diviſible into two diſtinct and more ſimple Ingredients, ſome more silful or happier Experimenter then I may find a way either further to divide one of theſe Spirits, or to reſolve ſome or other, if not all, oſthoſe other Ingredients of mixt Bodies, that have hitherto paſs:-d among Chymiſts for their Elements or Principles. ana2A uaAæ⸗ ttcrct P&Võbœœσvbò-œòt-ò-òσbrr©òσσ: THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Fourih Pari. A thus much (ſayes Carneades) may ſuffice to be ſaid of the Number of the Diſtinct ſubſtances ſeparable from mixt Bodies by the Fire: Wherefore I now proceed to conſider the nature of them, and ſhew you, That though they ſeem Homogeneous Bodies, yet have they not the purity and ſimplicity that is requiſite to Elements. And I ſhould immediately proceed to the proof of my Aſſertion, but that the Conſidence wherewith Chymiſts are wont to call each of the Subſtances we ſpeak of by the name of Sulphur or Mercury, or the other o? the HypoſtaO4 ticall Principles, and the intollerabln Ambiguity they allow themſelves ie theit Writings and Expreſſions, makes it neceſſary for me in Order to the Keeping you either from miſtaking me, or thinking I miſtake the Controverſie, to take Notice to you and complain of the unreaſonable Liberty they give themſelves of playing with Names at pleaſure. And indeed if IT were oblig'd in this Diſpute, to have ſuch regard to the Phraſeology oſ each particular Chymiſt, as not to Write any thing which this or that Author may not pretend, not to contradict this or that ſence, which he may give as Occaſion ſerves to his Ambiguous Expreſſions, I ſhould ſcarce know how to diſpute, nor which way to turn my ſelf. For I find that even Eminent Writers, (ſuch as Raymund Lully, Paracelſus and others) do ſo abuſe the termes they employ, that as they will no and then give divers things, one name; ſo they will oftentimes give one thing, many Names; and ſome of them (perhaps) ſuch, as do much more properly ſignifie ſome Diſtinct Body of another kind; nay even in Technical Words or Termes of A theyreſrain not from this ConfoundIng Liberty; but will, as T have Obſervd, call the ſame Subſtance, ſometimes the Sulphur, and Sometimes the Mercury of a Body. And now I ſpeak of Mercury, I cannor bur take Notice, that the Deſcriptions they give us oſ that Principle or Ingredient of mixt Bodies, are ſo intricate, that even thoſe that have Endeavourd to Polliſh and Illuſtrate the Notions of the Chymiſis, are fain to conſeſs that they know not what to make of it, cither by Ingenuous Acknowledgments, ò eſcriptions that are not Intelligie. I muſt conſeſs C ſaves Eleutherius ) I ave, in the reading o Paracelſus and other Chymical Authors, been troubled to find, that ſuch hard Words and Equivocal Expreſſions, as You juſtly complain of, do even when they treat of Principles, ſeem to be ſtudiouſly affected by thoſe Writers; whether to make themſelves to be admird by their Readers, and their Art appear more Venerable and Myſterious, or, ( as they would have us think) to conceal from them a Knowledge themſelves judge ineſtimable. But whatever (ſayes Carneades) theſe Men may promiſe themſelves from a Canting way of delivering the Principles oſ Naure, theywill find the Major part of Knowing Men ſo vain, as when they underſtand not what they read, to conclude, that it is rather the Writers fault then their ovn. And thoſe that are ſo ambitious to be admird by the Vulgar, that rather then go without the Admiration of the Ignorant they willexpoſe themſelves to the contempt of the Learned, thoſe ſhall, by myconſent, ſreely enjoy their Option. As for the Myſtical Writers ſcrupling to Communicate their Knowledge, they might leſs to their own Diſparagement, and to the trouble of their Readers, have conceald it by writing no Books, then by Writing bad ones. If Themistius were here, he would not ſtick to ſay, that Chymiſis write thus darkly, not becauſe they think their Notions too precious to be explaind, but becauſe they fear that if they were explaind, men would diſcern, that they are farr from being precious. And indeed, Ifear that the chief Reaſon why Chymiſts have written ſo obſcurely of their three Principles, may be, That not having Clear and Diſtinct Notions of them themſelves, they cannot write otherwiſe then Conſuſedl3 of what they but Confuſedly Apprehend: Not to ſay that divers of them, being Conſcious to the Invalidity of their Doctrine, might well enough diſcerne that they could ſcarce keep themſelves from being confured, bur by keeping themſelves ſrom being clearly underſtood. But though much may be ſaid to Excuſe the Chymiſts when they write Darkly, and ænigmatically, about the Preparation of their ælixir, and Some few other grand Arcana, the divulging of which they may upon Grounds Plauſible enough eſteem unfit; yet when they pretend to teach the Gencral Principles of Natural Philoſophers, this Equivocall Way of Writing is not to be endurd. For in ſuch Speculative Enquiries, where the naked Knowledge of the Truth is the thing Principally aimd at, what does he teach me worth thanks that does not, iſ he can, make his Notion intelligible to me, but by Myſtical Termes, and Ambiguous Phraſes darkens what he ſhould clear up; and maes me add the Trouble of gueſſing at the ſence of what he Equivocally expreſſes, to that of examining the Truth of what he ſeems to deliver. And if the matter of the Philoſophers Stone, and the manner of preparing it, be ſuch Myſteries as they would have the World believe them, they may Write Intelligibly and Clearly of the Principles of mixt Bodies in General, without Diſcovering what they call the Great Work. But for my part (Continues Carneades) what my Indignation at this Un- philoſophical way of teaching Principles has now extorted from me, is meant chiefly to excuſe my ſelf, if I ſhall hereafter oppoſe any Particular Opinion or aſſertion, that ſome Follower of Paracelſus or any Eminent Artiſt may pretend not to be his Maſteis. For, as I told you long ſince, Iam not Oblig'd to examine private mens writings, ( which were a Labour as endleſs as unprofitable) being only engag'd to examine thoſe Opinions about the Tria Prima, which I find thoſe Chymiſts I have met with to agree in moſt: And I Doubt not but my Arguments againſt ſily enough applicable evn to thoſe private Opinions, which they do not ſo directly and expreſly oppoſe. And indeed, that which I am now entering upon being the Conſideration of ihe things themſelves whereinto Spagyrists reſolve mixt Bodies by the Fire, If I can ſhew that theſe are not of an Elementary Nature, it will be no great matter what names theſe or thoſe Chymiſis have been pleaſed to give them. AndI queſtion not that to a Wiſe man, and conſequently to Eleutheriui, it will be leſſe conſiderable to know, what Men Have thought of Things, then what they Should have thought. In the fourth and laſt place, then, I conſider, that as generally as Chymiſts are wont to appeal to Experience, and as confidently as they uſc to inſtance the ſeveral ſubſtances ſeparated by the Fire from a Mixt Body, as a ſuſficient prooſf o their being its component Elements: Yet thoſe differing Subſtances are many of them farr enough from Elementary ſimplicity, and may be yer ]ookd upon as mixt Bodies, moſt of them alſo retaining, ſomewhat at leaſt, if not very much, of the Nature of thoſe Concretes whence they were forcd. Iam glad (ſayes Eleutheriis) to ſee the Vanity or Envy of the canting Chymiſts thus diſcover'd and chaſtisd; andI could wiſh, that Learned Men would conſpire together to make theſe deluding Writers ſenſible, that they muſt no longe hope with Impunity to abuſe the World. For whilſt ſuch Men are quietly permitted to publiſh Books with promiſing Titles, and therein to Aſſert what they pleaſe, and contradict others, and evn themſelves as they pleaſe, with as little danger oſbeing confuted as of being underſtood, they are encourag'd to get themſelves a name, at the coſt ol the Readers, by finding that intelligent Men are wont for the reaſlon newly mentiond, to let their Books and Them aJone: And the ignorant and credulous (of which the number is ſtill much greater then that of the other) are forward to admire moſt what they leaſt underſtand. Butif Judicious men skill'd in Chymical affaires ſhall once agree to write clearly and plainly of them, and thereby keep men from being ſtunn'd, as it were, or imposd upon by dark or empty Words;tis to be hop'd that theſe men finding that they can no longer write impertinently and abſurdly, without being laughvd at for doing ſo, will be reducd either © rite nothing or Books that may teach us ſomething, and not rob men, as formerly, of invaluable Time; and ſo ceaſing tò trouble the World with Riddles or Impertinencies, we ſhall either by their Books receive an Advantage, or by their ſilence eſcape an Inconvenience. But aſter all this is ſaid  continues Eleutherius) it may be repreſented in favour of the Chymiſis, that, in one regard the Liberty they take in uſing names, if it be eXcuſable at any time, may be more ſo when they ſpeak of the ſubſſances whereinto their Analyſis reſolves mixt Bodies: Since as Parents have the Right to name theit own Children, it has ever been allowd to the Authors of new Inventions, to Impoſe Names upon them. And thereforethe ſubjects we ſpeak of being ſo the Productions of the Chymiſts Art, as not to be otherwiſe, bur by it, obtainable; it ſeems bur equirable to g©e the Artiſts leave to name them as ihey pleaſe: conſidering alſo that none are ſo dies are, as they to whom we owd them. Itold You already (ſayes Carneades) that there is great Difference betwixt the being able to make Experiments, and the being able to give a Philoſophical Account of them. And Iill not now add, that many a Mine-digger may meet, whilſt he follows his work, with a Gemm or a Mineral which he knowes not what to make of, till he ſhews it a Jeweller or a Mineraliſt to be informd what it is. But that which Iwould rather have here obſervd, is, That the Chymiſts I am now in debate with have given up the Liberty You challengd for them, of uſing Names at Pleaſure, and confind Themſelves by their Deſcriptions, though but ſuch as they are, of their Principles; ſo that although they might freely have calld any thing their Analyſis preſents them with, either Sulphur, or Mercury, or Gas, or Blas, or what they pleas'd; yet when they have told me that Sulphur (for inſtance) is a Primogeneal and ſimple Body, Inflamable, Odorous, &c. they muſt give me leave to diſbelieve them, if they tell me that a Body that is either compounded or uninſlamable ⸗ ſuch a Sul with wor hur; and to think they play S, when they teach that Gold and ſome other Mineras abound with an Incombuſtible Sulphur, which is as proper an Expreſſion or Fluid Ice. , as a Sun-ſhine Night, But before Ideſcend to the Mention of Particulars belonging to my Fourth Conſideration, Ithink it convenient to premiſe a few Generals; ſome of which I ſhall the leſs need to inſiſt on at preſent, becauſe I have Touched on ready. them alAnd ſirſt I muſt invite vou to take notice of a certain paſſage in H elmont; which thoughI have not Found much heededby his Readers, He Himſelf mentions as a notable thing, and Itake to a very conſiderable one; for whereas the Diſtill'd oyle ofo;le- olive, thongh ex oleo, prout & ſuaviſſimus vini ſpiritus a vino Iad notabile, in vino eſſe Spirſtum quendam mitiorem ulterioris & nobilioris qualitatis participem quã qui immediatèper diſtillationem elicitur diciiurque uqua titæ dephlegmata, quod faci lius in ſimpliti olivarum oleo ad oculim ſpeſtatur.

Dulce enim tunc Oleum O livarum j hoc ratio erarantur, longèque ab aquæ vitæ acrimonià diſtinẽtus. drawn per ſe is (as I have tryd) of a very ſharp and fretting Quality, and of an odious taſt, FHe tells us that Simple oyle being only digeſted with Paracelſuss ſal circulatum, is redud into diſſimilar parts, and yields a ſweet Oyle, very differing from the oylediſtill'd, from ſallet oyle; as alſorhat by the ſame way there may be ſeparated from Wine a very ſweet and gentle Spirit, partaking of a far other and nobler quality then that which is Immediately drawn by diſtillation and call’d Dephlegmd Aqua vitæ, from whoſe Acrimony this other ſpirit is exceedingly remote, although the ſal circulatum that makes theſe ænatomies be ſeparated from the Analyæ'd Bodies, in the ſame weight and with the ſame qualities it had before; which Affirmation of Helmom if we admit to be true, e muſt acknowledge that there may be a very great diſparity betwixt bodies of the ſame denomination (as ſeveral oyles, or ſeveral ſpirits) ſeparable from compound Bodies: For, ſides the differences I ſhall anon take notice of, betwixt thoſe diſtil'd Oyles that are commonly known to Chymiſis, it appears by this, that by means be quite another ſort of Oyles obtaind from the ſame Body; and who knowes but that there may be yet other Agents found in Nature, by whoſe help there may, whether by Tranſmutation or otherwiſe, be obtaind from the Bodics Vulgarly calld Mixt, Oyles or other ſubſtances, Differing from thoſe of the ſame Denomination, known either to Vulgar Chymiſts, or even to Helmont Himſelf: but for fear You ſhould tell me, that this is but a conjecture grounded upon anorther Man's Relation, whoſc Truth we have not the means to Experiment, I will not Inſi*t upon it; bur leaving You to GConſider of it at lcaſure, Iſhall proceed to what is next. Secondly, Then if that be True which was the Opinion of Lucippus, Democritus, and other prime Anatomiſits of old, and is in our dayes reviv'd by no mean Philoſophers; namely, That our Culinary Fire, ſuch as Chymiſts uſe, conſiſts of ſwarmes of little Bodies ſwiftly moving, which by their ſmallneſs and motion are able to permeate the ſollideſt and Compacteſt Bodies, and even Glaſs it Self; It this (Iſay) be True, ſince we ſee that In flints and other Concretes, the Fiery pare is Incorporated with the Groſſer, it will not be Irrationall to conjecture, that multitudes of theſe Fiery Corpuſcles, getting in at the Pores of the Glaſs, may aſſociate themſelves with the parts of the mixt Body whereon they work, and with them Conſtitute new Kinds of Compound Bodies, according as ſhe Shape, Size, and other Affections of the Parts of the Diſſipated Body happen to diſpoſe them, in Reference to ſuch Combinations; of which alſo there may be the greater Number; if it be likewiſe granted that the Corpuſcles of the Fire, though all exceeding minute; and very ſwiftly moved; are not all of the ſame bigneſs, nor Figure. And if Ihad not Weightier Conſiderations to Diſcourſe to you of, I could name to you, to Countenance what I have newly ſaid, ſome particulat Experiments by which Ihave been Deducd to think, that the Particles of an open Fire working upon ſome Bodies may really Afſociate themſelves therewith, and add to the Quantity. Eut becauſe I am not ſo ſure, that when the Fire works upon Bodies included jection of the Fiery Corpuſcles themſelves, through the Subſtance of the Glaſs, Iwill proceed to what is next to be mentiond. Icould (ſayes Eleutherius) help you to ſome Proofes, whereby I think it may be made very probable, that when the Fire acts immediately upon a Body, ſome of its Corpuſcles may ſtick to thoſe of the burnt Body, as they ſeem to do in Quicklime, but in greater numbers, and more permanently. But for fear of retarding Your Progreſs, I ſhall deſire you to deferr this Enquiry till another time, and proceed as you intended. You may then in the next place (ſayes Carneades) obſcrve with me, that not only there are ſome Bodies, as Gold, and Silver,, which do not by the uſual Examens, made by Fire, Diſcover themſelves to be mixt3 but if (as You may Remember I formerly told You) it be a De- compound Body that is Diſſipable into ſeveral Subſtances, by being exposd to the Fire it may be reſolv' into ſuch as are neither Elementary, nor ſuch as it was upon its laſt mixture Compounded of; but into new Kinds of mixts. Of this I have already given You ſome Examples in Sope, Sugar of Lead, and Vitriol. Now it we ihall Conſider that there are ſome Bodies, as well Natural, C as that I laſt namd) as Factitious, maniſfeſtly Decompounded That in the Bowells of the Earth Nature may, as we ſee ſhe ſometimes does, make ſtrange Mixtures3 That Animals are nouriſd with other Animals and Plants3 And, that theſe themſelves have almoſt all of them their Nutriment and Growth, either from a certain Nitrous ſuice Harbour'd in the Pores of the Earth, or from the Excrements of Animalls, or from the putrifyd Bodies, either of living Creatures or Vegetables, or ſfrom orher Subſtances of a Compounded Nature; If, I ſay, we conſider this, it may ſcom probable, that there may be àamong the Works of Nature (not to mention thoſe of Art) a greater Number of De- compound Bodies, then men take Notice of; And indeed, as I have formerly alſo obſervd, it does not at all appear, that all Mixtures muſt be of Elementary Bodies; but it ſeems farr more probable, that there are divers ſorts of compound Bodies, even in regard of all or ſome of their Ingredients, conſiderd Antecœdently to their Mixture. For though ſome ſcem to be made up by the immediate Coalitions of the Elẽments, or Principles themſelves, and therefore may be call'd Prima Mista, or Miſta Primariazyet it ſeems that many other Bodies are mingſd ( if I may ſo ſpeak) atthe ſecond hand, their immeiate Ingredients being not Elementary, but theſe primary Mixts newly ſpoken of 3 And from divers of theſe Secondary ſort of Mixis may reſult, bya ſurther Compoſition, a Third ſort, and ſo onwards. Nor is it improbable, that ſome Bodies are made up of Mixt Bodies, not all of the ſame Order, but of ſeveral; as ( for Inſtance) a Concrete may conſiſt of Ingredients, whereof the one may have been a primary, the other a Secondary Mixt Body; (as I have in Native Cinnaber, by my way of Reſolving it, found both that Courſer the part that ſeems morelproperly to be Oar, and a Combuſtible Sulphur, and a Running Mercury:) or perhaps without any Ingredient of this latter ſort, it may be composd of Mixt Bodies, ſome o them of the firſt, and ſome of the third Kind3 And this may perhaps be ſomewhat Illuſtrated by reflecting upon what happens in ſome Chymical Preparations of thoſe Medicines which they call their Bezoardicums. For firſt, they take Antimony and Iron, which ma be lookd upon as Prima Miſia; of theſe they compound a Starry Regulus, and to this they add according to their Intention, either Gold, or Silver, which makes with it a new and further Compoſition. To this they add Sublimate, which is iĩt ſelf a De- compound body, (conſiſting of common Quickſilver, and divers Saſts United by Sublimation in10 a Cryſtalline Subſtance) and from this Sublimate, and the other Metalline Mixtures, they draw a Liquor, which may be allowd to be of a yet more Compounded Nature. If it be true, as Chymiſts affirm it, that by this Art ſome of the Gold or Silver mingl'd with the Regulus may be carryd over the Helme with it by the Sublimate; as indeed a Skilſull and Candid perſon complaind to me a while ſince, That an experienc'd Friend of His and mine, having by ſuch a way brought over a great Deal of Gold, in hope to do ſomething further with it, which mighr be gainfull to him, has not only miſsd oſ his Aim, bur is unable to recover his Volatili?d Gold out of the Antimonial butter, wherewith it is ſtrictly united. Now ( Continues Carneades) if a Compound body conſiſt of Ingredients that are not meerly Elementary; it is not hard to conceive, that the Subſtances into which the Fire Diſſolves it, though ſeemingly Homogeneous enough, may be of a Compounded Nature, thoſe parts of each body that are moſt of Kin aſſociating themſelves into a Compound of a new Kind. As when ( for example ſake) Ihave causd Vitrioll and Sal Armoniack,and Salt Petre to be mingſd and Deſtilld together, the Liquor that came over manifeſted it ſelf not to be either Spirit of Nitre, or of Sal Armoniack, or of Vitrioll. For none of theſe would diſſolve crude gold, which yet my Liquor was able readily to do; and thereby maniſfeſted iĩt ſelf to be a new Compound, conſiſting at leaſt of Spirit of Nitre, and Sal Armoniact, ( for the latter diſſolvd in the forme, vwill Work on Gold) which nevertheleſs are not by any known way ſeparable, and conſequently would not aſs for a Mixt Body, if we our ſelves id not, to obtain it, put and Diſtill together divers Concretes, whoſe Diſtinct Operations were known before hand. And, to add on this Occaſion the Experiment I lately promisd You, becauſe it is Applicable to our preſent purpoſe, I ſhall Acquaint You, that ſuſpecting the Common Oyle of Vitrioll not to be altogether ſuch a ſimple Liquor as Chymiſts preſume it, I mingd it with an equal or a Double Quantity (for Itryd the Experiment more then once) of common Oyle of Turpentine, ſuch as together with the other Liquor I bought at the Drugſters. And having careſully ( for the Experiment is Nice, and ſomewhat dangerous) Diitill'd the Mixture in a ſmall Glaſs Retort, I obtaind according to my Deſire, (beſides the two Liquors I had put in) a pretty Quantity of a certain ſubſtance, which ſticking all about the Neck of the Retort Biſcover it ſelf to be Sulphur, not only by a very ſtrong Sulphureous ſmell, and by the colour of Brimſtone3 bur alſo by this, That being put upon a coal, it was immediately kindI'd, and burnd like common Sulphur. And of this Subſtance I have yet by me ſome little Parcells , which You may command and examine when you pleaſe. So that from this Experiment I may deduce either one, or both of theſe Propoſitions, That a real Sulphur may be made by the Conjunction of two ſuch Subſtancẽs as Chymiſts take for Elementary, And which did not cither of them apart appear to have an ſuch body in it3 or that Ovle of Vitrioll though a DiſtilPd Liquor, and taken for part of the Saline Principle of the Concrete that yields it, may yet be ſo Compounded a body as to contain, beſides its Saline part, a Sulphur like common brimſtone, which would hardly be it ſelf a ſimple or un-compounded ody. ſmight purſues Carneades) remind You, thatI formerly repreſented it, as poſſible, That as there may be more Elements then five, or ſix3ſ0 the Elements of one body may be Different from thoſe oſ another 3 whe nce it would compound body, there may reſult Mixts of an altogether new kind, by the Coalition of Elements that never perhaps conven d beſore. I might, Iſay, mind You of this, and add divers things to this ſecond Conſideration; but for fear of wanting time Iwillingly pretermit them, to paſson to the third, which is this, That the Fire does not alwayes barely reſolve or take aſunder, but may alſo after a new manner mingle and compound together the parts (Whether Elementary or not) of the Body Diſſipated by t. This is ſo evident, ſayes Carneades, in ſome obvious Examples, that I cannot but wonder at theirSupineſs that have not taken notice of it. For when Wood being burnt in a Chimney is diſſipated by the Fire into Smoke and Arſhes, that ſmoke compoſes ſoot, which is ſo far from being any one of the principles of the Wood, that (as I noted above) you may by a further Analyſis ſeparate ſive or ſixdiſtinct ſubſtances fromit. And as for the remaining Aſhes, the Chymiſts themſelves teachus, that by a further degree of fire they may be indiſſolubly nalyſis which the Chymiſts principally build upon is made, not in the open air, but in cloſe Veſſels3 but however, the Examples lately producd may invite you ſhrewdly to ſuſpect, That heat may as well compound as diſſipate the Parts of mixt Bodies: and not to tell you, that I have known a Vitrification made even in cloſe veſſcls, I muſt remind you that the Flowers of Antimony, and thoſe of Sulphur, are very mixd Bodies, though they aſcend in cloſe veſſells: And that ?twas in ſtopt glaſſes that I brought up the whole Body of Camphire. And wWhereas it may be objected, that all theſe Examples are of Bodies ford up in a dry, not a Fluid forme, as are the Liquors wont to be obtaind by diſtillation; I anſwer, That beſides thattis poſſible, that a Body may be changd from Conſiſtent to Fluid, or from Fluid to Conſiſtent, without being otherwiſe much altered, as may appear by the Eaſineſs wherewith in Winter, without any Addition or Separarion of Viſible Ingredients, the ſame fubftance may be quickly hardend into brittle Ice, and thawd aain into Fluid Water;3 Beſides this, I ay it would be conſiderd, that common Quick- ſilver ĩt ſelf, which the Eminenteſt Chymiſts confeſs to be a mixt Body, may he Driven over the Helme in its Priſtine forme of Quickſilver, and conſcquently, in that of a Liquor. And certainly tis poſſible that very compounded Bodies may concur to Conſtitute Liquors; Since, not to mention that Ihave found it poſſible, by the help of a certain Menſtruum, to diſtill Gold it ſelf through a Retort, even with a Moderate Fire: Let us but conſider what happens in Butter of Antimony. For if that be careſully rectiſyd, it maybe reducd into a very clear Liquor; and yet if You caſt a quantity of fair water upon it, there will quickly precipitate a Ponderous and Vomitive Calx, which made before a conſiderable part of the Liquor, and yet is indeed (thoughſome eminent Chymiſts would have it Mercurial) an Antimonial Body carryed over and kept diſſolvà by the Salts of the Sublimate, and conſequently a compounded one;as You may find iĩf You will have the Curioſity to Examine this White powder by a skilful Reduction. And that You may not think that Bodies as compounded as flowers of Brimſtone cannot be brought to Concurr to Conſtitute Diſtil'd Liquors 3 And alſo That You may not imagine with Divers Learned Men that pretend no ſmall skill in Chymiſtry, that at leaſt no mixt Body can be brought over the Helme, but by corroſive Salts, I am ready to ſiew You; when You pleaſe, among other wayes of bringing over Flowers of Brimſtone ( perhaps I might add even Mineral Sulphurs) ſome, wherein I employ none but Oleaginous bodies to make Volatile Liquors, in which not only the colour, but (which is a much ſurer mark) the ſmell and ſome Operations maniſfeſt that there is brought over a Sulphur that makes part of the Liquor. One thing more there is, Eleutherius, ſayes Carneades, which is ſo pertinent to my preſent purpoſe, that though I have touch d upon itbeſore. I cannot but on this occaſion take notice ofit. Andit is this, That the Qualities or Accidents, upon whoſe account Chymiſts are wont to call a portion of Matter by the name of Mercury or ſome other of their Principles, are not ſuch but thattis poſſible as Great (and thereſore why not the like ?) may be produœd by ſuch change⸗ of Texture, and other Altcrations, as the Fire may make in the ſmall Parts of a Body. Ihave already prov'd, when I diſcoursd of the ſecond General Conſideration, by what happens to plants nouriſd only with fair water, and Egęs hatclidinto Chickens, that by changing the diſpoſition of the component parts of a Body, Nature is able to eſfect as great Changes in a parcell of Matter reputed ſimilar, as thoſe requiſire to Denominate one of the Tria Prima. And though Helmnt do ſomewhere wittily call the Fire the Deſtructor and the Artificial Death of Things;3 And although another Eminent cymin and Phyſtian be pleasd to build upon this, That Fire can never generate any thing but Firc5 Yet You will, Idoubt not, be of another mind, If You conſider how many new ſorts of mixt Bodies Chymiſts themſclves have producd by means of the Fire: And particularly, if You conſider how that Noble and Permanent Body, Glaſs, is not only manifeſtly produc'd by the violent action of the Fire, but has never, forought we know, been producd any other way. And indeed it ſooms but an inconſiderate Aſſertion of ſome Helmontians, that every ſort of Body of a Peculiar Denomination muſt be producd by ſome Seminal power; as I think Icould evince, if I thought iĩt ſo neceſſary, as it is for me to haſten to what I have further to diſcourſe. Nor need it much move us, that there are ſome who look upon whatſoever the Fire is employd to produce, not as upon Natural but Artificial Bodies. For there is not alwaies ſuch a difference as many imagine berwixt the one and the other: Nor is it ſo eaſyas they thin, clearly to aſſigne that which Properly, Conſtantly, and Sufficiently, Diſcriminates them. But not to engage my ſelf in ſo nice a Diſquiſition, it may no ſuffice to obſerve, that a thing is commonly termed Artificial, when a parcel of matter is by the Artificers hand, or Tools, or both, brought to ſuch a ſhape or Form, as he Deſignrd before-hand in his Mind: Whereas in many of the Chymical Productions the effect would be produc'd whether the Artificer intended it or no; and is oftentimes very much other then he Intended or Lookt for: and the Inſtruments employæd, are not Tools Artificially faſhiod and haped, like thoſe of Tradeſmen, for this or that particular Work; bur, for the moſt part, Agents of Natures own providing, and whoſe chicP Powers of Operation they receive from their own Nature or Texture, not the Artificer. And indeed, the Fire is as well a Natural Agent as Secd: And the Chymiſt that imployes it, docs but apply Natural Agents and Patients, vho being thus brought together, and acting according to their reſpective Natures, performe the worke themſelves; as Apples, Plums, or other fruit, are natural Productions, though the Gardiner bring and faſten together the Sciens of the Stock, and both Water, and do perhaps divers other wayes Contribute to its bearing fruit. But, to proceed to what Iwas going to ſay, You may obſerve with me, Eleutheriius, that, as I told You once before, Qualities ſleight enough may ſerve to Denominate a Chymical Principle. For, when they anatomize a compound Body by the Fire, if they geta Subſtance inhiamable, and that will not mingle with Water, that they preſently call Sulphur; what is ſapid and Diſſoluble in Watecr, that muſt paſſc forSalt; Wharſociet is fixd and indiſſoluble in Water, that they name Earth. And Iwas going to add, that, whatſoever Volatile iubſtance they know not what to make of, not to fay, whatſoever they pleaſe, that they call Mercury. But that theſe Qualities may cither be producd, otherwiſe then by ſuch as they call Seminal Agents, or may belong to bodies of a compounded Nature, may be ſhewn, among other Inſtances, in Glaſs made of aſhes, where the exceeding ſtrongly- tated Alealizate Salt joyning with the Earth becomes inſipid, and with it conſtitutes a Body, which though alſo dry, fixt, and indiſſoluble in Water, is yet maniſcſily a mixt Body;and made ſo by the Fire it nſ And Iremmember to our preſent purpoſe, that Helmont, amongſt other Medicines that he commends, has a ſhort proceſſe, wherein, though the Directions for Practice are but obſcurely intimated; yet Ihave ſome reaſon not to Diſ-belicve the Proceſs, without aſfiuming or denying any thing about the vertues of the remedy to be made by it. Quando (ſayes he) oleum cinnamomi &. ſuo ſali alkali miſcetur abſque omni aua, trium menſium artificioſa occultaque circulatione, totum in ſalem volaQ⸗ tilem commutatum est, vere eſſentiam ſui ſimplicis in nobis exprimit, & uſque in prima noſtri constitutiva ſeſe ingerit. Anot unlike Proceſſe he delivers in another place; ſrom whence, if we ſuppoſe him to ſay true, l may argue, that ſince by the Fire there may be producd a ſubſtance that is as well Saline and volatile as the Salt of Harts-horn, blood, &c.which paſ for Elementary;3 and ſince that this Volatile Salt is really compounded of a Chymical Oyle and a fixt Salt, the one made Volatile by the orher, and both aſſociated by the fire, it may well be ſuſpected that other Subſtances, emerging upon the Diſſipation of Bodies by the Fire, may be new ſorts of Mixts, and conſiſt of subſtances of differing natures; and particularly, I have ſometimes ſuſpected, that ſince the Volatile Salts of Blood, Harts-horn, &c. are figitive and endow d with an exceeding ſtrong ſmell, either that Chymiſts do Erroneouſly aſcribe all odours to ſulphurs, or that ſuch Salts conſiſt of ſome oyly parts well incorporated with the Saline ones. And the like conjecture I have alſo made concerning Spirit of Vinager, which, though the Chymiſts think one of the Drinciple⸗ of that Body, and though being an Acid Spirit it ſeems to be much leſs of in then Volatile Salts to ſulphurs; yet, not to mention its piercing ſmell; which I know not with what congruity the Chymiſt will deduce from salt, I wonder they have not taken notice of what their own Tyrocinium Chymicum teach us concerning the Deſtillation of Sæccharum Saturni 3 out of which Bequinus aſſures Us, that he diſtill'd, beſides a very fine ſpirit, no leſſe then two Oyles, the one bloodred and ponderous, but the other ſwimming upon the top of the Spirit, and of a yelio colour3 of which he ſayes that e kept then ſome by him, to veriſy what he deliverss. And though I remember not that Ihave had two diſtinct Oyles from Sugar of Lead, yet that it ill though diſtil'd withour addition yield ſome Oyle, diſagrees not with my Experience. Iknow the Chymiſts will be apt to pretend, that theſe Oyls are but the volatilizd ſulphur of the lead; and ill perhaps argue it from what Beguinus relates, that when the Diſtillation is ended, youl find a Caput Mortuum extreamly blac, and (as he ſpeaks) nallius momenti, as if the Body, or at leaſt the chief part of the Metal it ſelf were by the diſtillation carried over the Helme. But ſince you know as well as I that Saccharum Saturni is a kind of Magiſtery, made only by calcining of Lead per ſe, diſſolving it in diſtill'd Vinager, and cryſtalizing the ſo]ution; itI had leaſure to tell You how Differing a thing Idid upon examination find the Caput Mortuum, ſo ſleighted by Leguinus, to be from what he repreſents it, Ibelieve you would think the conjecture proposd leſs probable then one or other of theſe three; either that this Oyle did formerly concur to conſtitute the Spirit of Vinager, and ſo that what aſſes for a Chymical Principle may yet be further reſoluble into diſtinct ſubſtances; or that ſome parts of the Spirit together with ſome parts of the Lead may conſtitute a Chymical Oyle, which therefore though it paſs for Homogeneous, maybe a very compounded Body: or at leaſt that by the action of the Diſtill'd Vinager and the Sarurnine Calx one upon another, part of the Liquor may be ſo alter'd as to be tranſmuted from an Acid spirit into an Oyle. And though the truth of either of the two former conjectures would make the example I have reflected on more pertinent to m preſent argument; yet youl eaſily diſccrn, the Third and laſt Conjecture cannot be unſcrviceable to confirm ſome other paſſages of my diſcourſe. To return then to what Iwas ſaying jut before I mentiod Helmont's Experiment, I ſnhall ſubjoyne, That Chymiſts muſt confeſs alſo that in the perſectly Dephlegm⸗d ſpirit of Wine, or other Fermented Liquors, that which they call the sulphur of the Concrete Ioſes, by the Fermentation, the Property of Oyle, (which the Chymiſis likewiſe take to be the true Sulphur of the Mixt) of being unminglable with the Water. And i You vil] credit Helmont, all of the pureſt Spirit of Wine may barely by the help of pure Salt of Tartar (which is but the fixed Salt of Wine) be reſolv-d or Tranſmuted into ſcarce half an ounce of Salt, and as much Elementary Water as amounts to the remaining part of the mention'd weight. And it may (as Ithink Iformerly alſo noted) be doubted, whether that Fixt and Alcalizate Salt, which is ſo unanimouſly agreed on to be the Saline Principle of incinerated Bodics, be not, as tis Alcalizate, a Production oſ the Fire? For though the talt of Tartar, for Example, ſeem to argue that it contains a Salt before it be burnd, yet that Salt being very Acid is of a quite Differing Talt from the Lixiviate Sale of Calcid Tartar. And thoughit be not truly Objected againſt the Chymiſs, that they obtain all salis they make, by reducing the Body they work on into Aſhes with Violent Fires, (ſince Hartshorn, Amber, Blood, and divers other Mixts yield a copious Salt before they be burn'd to Aſhes) yet this Volatile Salt Differs much, as we ſhall ſee anon, from the Fixt Alcalizate Salt I ſpeak of; which for ought I remember is not producible by any known Way, without Incineration. Tis not unknown to Chymiſts, that Quickſilver may be Precipitated, without Addition, into a dry Powder, that remains ſo in Water. And ſome eminent Spagyrists, and even Raimund Lully himſelf, teach, that meerly by the Fire Quickſilver may in convenient Veſſels be reduc'd (at leaſt in great part) into a thin Liquor like Water, and minglable with it. So that by the bare Aion of the Fire, tis poſſible, that the paris oſ a mixt Body ſhould be ſo diſposd aſter new and differing manners, that it may be ſometimes oF one conſiſtence, ſometimes of another3 And may in one State be diſpos'd to be mingſ'd with Water, and in another not. I could alſo ſhew you, that Bodies ſrom which apart Chymiſis cannot obtain any thing that is Combuſtible, may by being aſſociated together, and by the help of the Fire, afford an inflamable Subſtance. And that on the other ſide,tis poſſible for a Body to be inflamable, from which it would very much puzzle any ordinary Chymiſt, and perhaps any other, to ſeparate an inflamable Principle or Ingredient. Wrherefore, ſince the Principles of Chymiſts may receive their Denominations from Qualities, which it often excceds not the power of Art, nor alwayes that of the Firc to produce; And ſince ſuch Qualities may be found in Bodies that differ ſo much in other Qualities from one another, that they need not be allowd to agree in that pure and fimple Nature, which PrinciPles, to be ſo indeed, muit have; it may juſtly be ſuſpected, that many Pmoductions of the Fire that are ſhcwd us by Chymiſts, as the Principles of the Concrete that afforded them, may be but a new kind of Mixts. And to annex, on this Occaſion, to theſe arguments taken from the Nature of the thing, onc of thoſe which Logicians call aà Hominem, I ſhall deſire You to take Notice, that though Paracelſiu Himſelf, and ſome that are ſo miſtaken as to think he could not be ſo, have ventur'd to teach, that not only the bodies here below, but the Elements themſelves, and all the other Parts of the Univerſe, are compos'd of Salr, Sulphur and Mercury; yet the learned Sennertus, and all the more wary Chymiſts, have rejected that conceit, and do many of them confeſs, that the Tria Prima are each of them made up of the four Elements3 and others of them make Earth and Water concur with Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, to the Conſtitution of Mixt bodies. So that one ſort of theſe Spagyriſis, notwithſtanding the ſpecious Titles rhey give to the productions of the Fire, do in efſect grant ther ſort T may well demand, to what Kind of Bodies the Phlegme and dead Earth, to be met with in Chymical Reſolutions, are to be referr?d? For eĩther they muſt ſay, with Paracelſus, but againſt their ovn Conceſſions as well as againſt Experience, that theſe are alſo composd of the Tria Prima, whereof they cannot ſeparate any one from either of them; or elſe they muſt confeſs that two of the vaſteſt Bodies here below, Earth, and Water, are neither of them compoyd of the Tria Prima; and that conſequently thoſe three are not the Univerſal, and Adequate Inredients , neither of all Sublunary Boies, nor even of all mixt Bodies. Iknow that the chief of theſe Chymiſts repreſent, that though the Diſtinct Subſtances into which they divide mixt bodies by the Fire, are not pure and Homoge neous3 yet ſince the four Elements into which the Aristotelians pretend to reſolve the like bodies by the ſame Agent, are not ſimple neither, as themſelves acknowledge, tis as allowable for the Chymiſts to call the one Principles, as for the Peripateticks to call the other Elements; ſince in both caſes the Impoſition of the name is grounded only upon the Predominancy of that Element whoſe name is aſcribd to it. Nor ſhall Ideny, that this Argument of the Chymiſts is no ill one againſt the Ariſtotelians. But what Anſwer can it prove to me, who you know am diſputing againſt the Aristotelian Elemenis, as the Chymicall Principles, and muſt not look upon any body as a true Principle or Element, but as yet compounded, which is not perfectly Homogeneous, but is further Reſoluble into any number of Diſtinct Subſtances how ſmall ſoever. And as for the Chymiſts calling a body Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, upon pretence that the Principle of the ſame name is predominant in it, That it ſelf is an Acknowledgment of what Icontend for; namely that theſe productions of the Fire, are yet compounded bodies. And yet whilſt this is ramic, it is affirmd, but not provd, that the reputed Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, conſiſts mainly of one body that deſerves the name of a principle of the ſame Denomination. For how do Chymiſts make it appear that there dies in thoſe we are ſpeaking of; ſince tis upon the matter confeſs'd by the anſwer lately made, that theſe are not ſuch? And if they pretend by Reaſon to evince what they affirm, what becomes of their confident boaſts, that the Chymiſts (whom they therefore, after Beguinis,call a Philoſophus or Opifex Senſatus) can convince our Eyes, by manifeſtly ſhewing in any mixt body thoſe ſimple ſubſtances he teaches them to be compos'd of ? And indeed, for the Chymiſts to have recourſe in this caſe to other prooſs then Experiments, as it is to wave the grand Argument that has all this while been given out for a Demonſtrative One; ſo it releaſes me from the obligation to proſecute a Diſpute wherein I am not engagd to Examine any but Experimentall proofs. I know it may plauſibly Enough be Repreſented, in favour of the Chymiſis, that it being evident that much the greater part of any thing they call Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, is really ſuch; it would be very rigid to deny thoſe Subſtances the names aſcribed them, only becauſe of ſome ſlcight mixture of another Body; ſince not only the Peripateticks call particular parcels of matter Elementary, though they acknowledge that Elements are not to be anywhere found pure, at leaſt here below; And ſince eſpecially there is a maniſeſt Analogic and Reſemblance betwixt the bodies obtainable by Chymical Anatomies and the principles whoſe names are given them; I have, Iſay, conſiderd that theſc things may be repreſented: But as for what is drawn from the Cuſtome of the Peripateticks, I have already told You, that though it maybe empy⸗ againſt Them, Yet it is not availale againſt me who allow nothing to be an Element that is not perfectly Homogeneous. And whereas it is alledgĩd, that the Predominant Principle ought to give a name to the ſubſtance wherein it abounds3 I anſwer, that that might much more reaſonably be ſaid, iſ either we or the Chymiſts had ſeen Nature take pure Salt, pure sulphur, and pure Mercury, and compound of them every ſort of Mixt Bodies. But, ſincetis to cxperience that they appeal, we muſt not take it for granted, that the Diſtill'd Oyle (for inſtance) ofa plant is mainly composd of the pure principle calldSulphur, till they have given us an ocular proof, that there is in that ſort of Plants ſuch an Homogeneous Sulphur. For as for the ſpecious argument, which is drawn from the Reſemblance betwixt the Productions of the Fire, and the Reſpective, either Aristotelian Elements, or Chymical Principles, by whoſe names they are call'd; it will appear more plauſible then cogent, if You willbut recall to mind the ſtate of the controverſie; which is not, whether or no there be obtaid from mixt Bodies certain ſubſtances that agree in outward appearance, or in ſome Qualities ith Quickſilver or Brimſtone, or ſome ſuch obvious or copious Body; But whether or no all Bodies confeſsd to be perfectly mixt were composd of, and are reſoluble into a determinate number of primary unmixt Bodies. For, if you keep the ſtate of the queſtion in your Eve, you'l eaſily diſcerne that there is much of what ſhonld be Demonſtrated, left unprov'd by thoſe Chymical Experiments we are Examining. But (not to repeat what I have already diſcoverd more at large) Iſhall now take notice, that it ill not preſently follow, that becauſe a Production of the Fire has ſome affinity with ſome of the greater Maſte⸗ of matter here below, that therefore they are both of the ſame Nature, and deſerve the ſame Name; for the Chymiſts are not content, that flame ſhould be look't upon as a parcel of the Element of Fire, though it be hot, dry, and active, becaule it wants ſome other Qualities belonging to the nature of Elementary firc. Nor will they let the Peripateticks call Aſhes, or Quicklime, Earth, notwithſtanding the many likeneſſes between them; becauſe the are not taſtleſſe, as Elementary Eart ought to be: But if you ſhould ask me, what then it is. that all the Chymical Anatomies of Bodies do prove, ifthey prone not that they conſiſt of the three rinciples into which the fire reſolves them? Ianſwer, that their Diſſections may be granted to prove, that ſome mixt bodies (for in many it will not hold ) are by the fire, when they are included in cloſe Veſſels, (for that Condition alſo is oſten requiſite) diſſolube into ſeveral Sub ſtances differing in ſome Qualities, but principally in Conſiſtence. 5 that out of moſt of them may be obtaind a fixt ſubſtance partly ſaline, and partly inſipid, an unctuous Liquor, and another Liquor or more that without being unctuous have a maniſfeſt taſte. Now if Chymiſts ill agree tocall the dry and ſapid ſubſtance ſalt, the Unctuous liquor Sulphur, and the other Mercury, I ſhall not much quarrel with them for ſo doing: But if theywill tell me that Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, are ſimple and primary bodics whereof each mixt body was actually compounded, and which was really in it antecedently to the operation of the fire, they muſt give me leave to doubt whether ( whatever their other arguments may do) their Experiments prove all this. And if they will alſo tell me that the Subſtances their Anatomies are wont to afford them, are pure and ſimilar, as Principles ought to be, they muſt give me leave to believe my own ſenſes; and their own confeſſions, before their bare Aſſertions. And that you may not (Eleutberias think Ideal ſo rigialy with them, becauſe I ſcruple to Take theſe Productions of the Fire for ſuch as the Chymiſts would have them paſs for, upon the acoount of their having ſome affinity with them; conſider a little with me, that in regard an Element or Principle ought to be perſectly Similar and Homogeneous, there is no juſt cauſe why I ſhould rather give the body propos'd the Name of this or that Element or Principle, becauſe it has a reſemblance to it in ſome obvious Quality, rather then deny it that name upon the account oſ divers other Qualities, wherein the proposd Bodies are unlike; and if you do but conſider what ſleight and eaſily producible qualities they are that ſuffice, asI have altcady more then once obſervd, to Denominate a Chymical Principle or an Element, youl not, I hope, think my warineſs to be deſtitute cither of Example, or elſe of Reaſon. For we ſee that the Chymiſts will not allow the Ariſiotelians that the Salt in Aſhes ought to be called Ea-rth, rthough the Saline and Terreſtrial patt ſymbolize in weight, in dryneſs, in fixneſs and ſuſibility, only becauſe the one is fapid and diſſoluble in Water, and the other not: Beſides, we ſce that ſapilneſs and volatility are wonr to denominate 21le Chymiſts Merury or Spirit 3 and yet how many Bodies, think you, mav agree in thoſe Qual©ties which liay vet he of very diRering natures, and diſagree in qualities either more numourou3, or more conſiderable,or both. For not only Spirit oſ Nitre, Aqua Fortis, Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Oyle of Vitriol, Spirit of Allome, Spirit of Vinager, and all Saline Liquors Diſtil'd from Anmal Bodies, but all the Acetous Spirits o Woods freed ſrom theit Vinager; All theſe, I ſay, and many othcrs muſt belong to the Chymiſts Mercury, though it appear not why ſome o? them Thould more be comprehended under onc denomination then the Chymiſits Sulphur, or Oyle ſhould likewiſe be; for their Diſtild Oyles are alſo Fluid, Volatile, and Taltable, as well as their Mercury 3 Nor is it Neceſſary, that theirt Sulphur ſmould be Un&tuous or Diſſoluble in Water, ſince they genetally refcrr Spirit of Wine to Sulphuss, although that Spirit be not Unctuous, and will ſreely mingle with Water. So that bare Inflamability muRt conſlitute the Eſſence of the Chymiſts Sulphur 3 as uninflamableneſſe joyned with any taſte is enough to intitle a Diſtill'd Liquor to be tlieir Mercury. Now ſince I can ſurther obſerve to You, that Spirit of Nitre and Spirit of Harts ome being pour'd together will boile and hiſſe and toſſc up one another into the air, which the Chymiſ make lignes of great Antipathy in the Natures of Bodies (as indeed theſe Spirits differ much both in Taſte, Smell, and Operations;) Since I elſewhere tell you of my having made two ſorts of Oyle out of the ſame mans blood, that would not mingle with one another3 And ſince I might tell You Divers Examples I have met with, of the Contrariety oſ Bodies which according to the Chymiſts muit be huddI'd up toge ther under onc Denomination; lcave you to Judge whether ſuch a multitude of Subiſtances as may agree in theſe ſleight Qualitics, and yet Diſagree in Others more Conſiderable, are more worthy to be calld by the Name of a Principle which ought to be pure and homogeneous, ) than to have appellations given them that may make them diffor, in name too, from the bodies from which they ſo wildly differ in Nature. And hence alſo, by the bye, you may perceive that tis not unreaſonable to diſtruſt the Chymiſts way of Argumentation, when being unable to ſhiew us mhar ſuch a Liquor is (for Example) purely ſaline, they prove, that at leaſt ſalt is much the predominant principle, becauſe that the proposd ſubſtance is ſtrongly taſted, and all Taſt proceeds ſrom ſalt; whereas thoſe Spirits, ſuch as ſpirit of Tartar, ſpirit of Harts-horn, and the like, which are reckoned to be the Mercuries of the Bodies that afford them, have manifeſtly a ſtrong and piercing taſt, and ſo has (according to what I formerly noted) the ſpirit of Box &c. even aſicr the acid Liquor that concurrd to compoſe it has been ſeparated from it. And indeed, if ſapidneſs belong not to the ſpirit or Mercurial Principle of Vegitables and Animals: I ſcarce know how it will be diſcriminated from their phlegm, ſince by the abſence of Inflamability it muſt be diſtinguiſd from their ſulphur, which affords me another Example, 1o prove how unacurate the Chymical Doctrine is in our preſent Caſc; ſince not only the ſpirits of Vegitables and Animuls, but their Oyles are very ſtrongly taſted, as he that ſhall but wet his tongue with Chymical Oyle of Cinnamon, or of Cloves, or ęven of Turpentine, may quickly find, to his ſmart. And not only I never try'd any Chymical Oyles whoſe taſt was not very manifeſt and ſtrong;but a skiiſul and inquiſitive perſon who made it his buſineſs by elaborate operations to depurate Chymical Oyles, and reduce them to an Elementary ſimplicity, Informes us, that he never was able to make them at all Taſtleſs; whence I might inforr, that the prooſ Chymiſts conſidently give us of a bodies being ſaline, is ſo far ſrom demonſtrating the Predominancy, that it does not clearly Evince ſo much as the preſence oſ the ſaline Principle in it. But I will not ( purſues Carneades) remind you, that the Volatile ſalt of Harts- horn, Amber, Blood, &c. are exceeding ſtrongly ſc|nted, notwithſtaiiding that moſt Chymiſts deduce Odours from Sulphur, and ſrom them argue the Predominancy of that Principle in the Odorous body, becauſe I muſt not ſo much as add any new Examples of the incompetency of this ſort of Chymical arguments; ſince having already detaind You but too long in thoſe generals thar appertain to my fourth confideration, tis time that Iproceed to the particulars themſclves, to which I thought fit they ſnhould be previous: Theſe Generals (continues Carneades) being thus premisd, we might the better ſurvey the Unlikeneſs that an attentive and unprepoſſeſs'd obſerver may take notice of in cach ſort of Bodies which the Chymiſts are wont to call the ſalts or ſulphurs or Mercuries of the Concretes that yield Them, as if they had alla ſimplicity,and Identity of Nature: whereas ſalts if they were all Elementary would as little differ as do the Drops of pure and ſimple Water.ſis known that borh Chymiſts and Phyſitians aſcribe to the fixt ſalts of calcind Bodies the vertues of their concretes; and conſequently very diſtering Operations. So we find the Albali of Wormwood much commended in diſtempers of the ſtomach; that of Eycbright for thoſe that have a weak ſight; and that of Guaiacum (of which a great Quantity yields buta very little ſalt) is not only much commended in Venereal Diſeaſes, but is believed to have a peculiar purgative vertue, which yet I have not had occaſion to try. And though, I confeſs, I have long thought, that theſe Altalizate ſalts are, for the moſt part,very neer of kin, and retain very little of the properties of the Concretes whence they were ſeparated Yet being minded to Obſerve watchſully whether I could meet with any Exceptions to this General Obſervation, Iobſerv'd at the Glaſſe- houſe, that ſometimes the Metal (as the Workmen call it) or Maſſe of colliquated Ingredients, which by Blowing they faſhion into Veſſels of divers ſhapes, did ſometimes prove of a very differing colour, and a ſomewhat differing Texture, from what was uſuall. And having enquired whether the cauſe of ſuch Accidents might not be derived from the peculiar Nature of the fixt ſalt employd to bring the ſand to fuſion, I found that the knowingſt Workmen imputed theſe Miſ- adventures to the Aſhes, of ſome certain kind of Wood, as having obſervd the ignobler kind of Glaſs Ilately mentiond to be frequently producd when they had employd ſuch ſorts of Aſhes which therefore they ſcruple to make uſe of, if they took notice of them beforehand. I remember alſo, that an Induſtrious Man of my acquaintance having bought a vaſt quantity of Tobacco ſtalks to make a fixt Salt with, Ihad the Curioſity to go ſve whether that Exotick Plant, which ſo much abounds in volatile ſalt, would afford a peculiar kind of Alcali 3 andI was pleas'd to find that in the Lixivium of it, it was not nece ſſary, as is uſual, to evaporate all the Liquor, that thero might be obtaind a Saline Calx, conſiſting like lime quenc?æd in the Air of a heap of little Corpuſcles of unregarded ſhapes: but the fixt ſalt ſnor into figurd Cryſtal, almoſt as Nitre or Sal-armoniack and other uncalcind ſalts are wont to do And I further remember that I have obſervd in the fixt Salt of Urine, brought by depuration to be very white, a taſt not ſo unlike to that of common ſalt, and very differing from the wonted cauſtick Lixiviate taſt of orher ſalts made by Incineration. But becauſe the Inſtances I have alledgd of the Difference of Aloalizate ſalt are but few, and therefore I am ſtill inclind to think, tha: moſ Chymiſts and many Phyſitians do, inconſideratly enough and without Warrant from Experience, aſcribe the Vertues of the Concretes exposd to Calcination, to the ſalts obtaind by it; I ſhall rather, to ſhew the Diſparity of ſalts, mention in the firſt Place the apparent Difference betwixt the Vegetable fixt ſalts nd the Animal Volatile ones: As ( for Example) betwixt ſalt of Tartar, and ſalt of Harts-horn3 whereof the former is ſo fixt thattwill indure the brunt of a violent Fire,and ſtand in fuſion like a Metal3 whereas the other (beſides that it has a differing taſt and a very differing ſmell) is ſo far from being fixt, that it will fly away in a gentle heat as eaſilyas ſpirit of Wine it ſelf. And to this I ſhall add, in the next place, That even among the Volatile ſalts tchemſclves, there is a conſiderable Difference, as appears by the diſtinct Properties of (for Inſtance) ſalt of Amber, ſalt of Urine, ſalt of Mans Skull, (ſo much extoll'd againſt the falling Sickneſſe) and divers others which cannot eſcape an ordinary Obſerver. And this Diverſity of Volatile ſalts Ihave obſcervd to be ſomtimes Diſcernable even to the Eye, in their Figures. For the ſalt of Harts-horn I have obſervd to adhere to the Receiver in the forme almoſt of a Parallelipipedon; and of the Volatile ſale o? humane blood ( long digeſted before diſtillation, with ſpirit of Wine) Ican ſhew you ſtore of graines of that Figure which Geometricicns call a Rhomtus; though I dare nor undertake that the Figures of theſe orother Saline Cryſtals (if I may ſo call Them) willbe alwaies the ſame, whatever degree of Fire have been employd to force them up, or how haſtily ſoever they have been made to convene in the ſpirits or liquors, in the lower part of which Ihave uſually obſerv'd them after a while to ſhoot. And although, as I lately told You, I ſeldom found any Difference, as to Medical Vertues, in the fixt Salts of Divers Vegetables;3 and accordingly Ihave ſuſpected that moſt of theſe volatile Salts, having ſo great a Reſemblance in ſmell, in taſt, and ſugitiveneſs, differ but little, if at all, in theit Medicinal properties: As indeed I have found them generally to agree in divers ot them (as in their being ſomewhat Diaphoretick and very Deopilative; Yet Iremember Helmont ſomewhere informes us, that there is this Error vero per diſtillationem nobis monſtrat ctiam Spiritum ſalinum plane volatilem odore nequicquam ut nec guſtu diſtinguibilem a ſpiritu Vrinæ3 In eo tamen eſſentialiter diverſum.quod ſpiritus talis cruoris curat Epilepſiam,non autęm ſpiritus ſalis lotii.

Of the Eſficacy alſo of the Salt of Common Amber againſt the ſame Diſcaſe in Children, (for in Grown Perſons it is not a ſpecifickD I may elſewhere have an Occaſion to Entertain You. And when I conſider that to the obtaining of theſe Volatile Salts (eſpecially that of Urine) there is not requiſite ſuch a Deſtructive Violence of the Fire, as there is to get thoſe Salts that muſt be made by Incineration, I am the more invited to conclude, that they may differ from one another, and conſcquently recede ſrom an Elementary Simplicity. And, if I could here ſiew You what Mr. Boyle has Obſerv'd, touching the Various Chymicall Diſtinctions of Salts;3 You would quickly diſcern, not only that Chymiſts do give themſcelves a ſtrange Liberty to call Concretes Salts, that are according to their owvn Rules to be look'd upon as very Compounded Bodies; but that among thoſe very Salts that ſecom Elementary, becauſe produc'd upon the Anatomy of the Bodies that yield them, there is not only a viſible Diſparity, guage, a manifeſt Antipathy or Contrariety: As is evident in the Ebullition and hiſſing that is wont to enſue, when the Acid Spirit of Vitrioll, for Inſtance, is pour'd upon pot aſhes, or Salt of Tartar. And Iſhall beg leave of this Gentleman, ſayes Carneades, caſting his Eyes on me, to let me obſerve to You out of ſome of his papers, particularly thoſe wherein he treats of ſome Preparations of Urine, that not only one and the ſame body may have two Salts of a contrary Nature, as he exemplifies in the Spirit and Altali of Nitre; but that from the ſame body there may without addition be obtaind three differing and Viſible Salts. For He Relates, that he obſervd in Urine, not only a Volatile and Cryſtalline Salt, and a fixt Salt, but likewiſe a kind of Sal Armoniack, or ſuch a Salt as would ſublime in the form of a ſalt, and therefore was not fixt, and yet was far from being ſo fugitive as the Volatile ſalt3 from which it ſcomd alſo otherwiſe to differ.]have indeed ſuſpected that this may be a Sal Armoniack properly enough ſo call’]d, as Compounded of the Volatile ſalt of Urine, and the fius of the ſame Liquor, which, as I noted, is not unlike ſca-ſalt3 but that it ſelf argues a maniſeſt Difference betwixt the ſalts, ſince ſuch a Volatile ſalt is not wont to Unite thus with an ordinary Alcali, but to fly away from it in the Heat. And on this occaſion I remember that, to give ſome of my Friends an Ocular prooſ of the difference betwixt the fixt and Volatile ſalt Cof the ſame Concrete) Wood, I devis'd the following Experiment. I took common Venetian ſublimate, and diſſolv'd as much of it as I well could in fair Water: then Itook Wood Aſhes, and pouring on them Warme Water, Diſſolvd their ſalt; and filtrating the Water, as ſoon as I found the Lixivium ſufficiently ſharp upon the tongue, Ireſervd it for uſe: Then on part of the former ſolution of ſublimate dropping a little of this Diſſolvd Fixt ſalt of Wood, the Liquors preſently turd of an Orange Colour; but upon the other part of the clear ſolution of ſublimate putting ſome of the Volatile ſalt of Wood ( which abounds in the ſpirit of ſoort) the Liquor immediately ter a while let fall a white ſediment, as the other Liquor did àa Yellow one. To all this that I have ſaid concerning the Difference of ſalis,I might add what I Formerly Aliquando oleum Cinnamomi, t-r. ſuo ſali Alcalimiſoetur abſque omn aqua, nium megſium Ariificicſa occultaque circulatione, totum in ſalem volatilem commutatum est.

AndI might alſo annex, what Inoted to you out of Helmont concerning Bodies, which, though they conſiſft in great part of Chymical Oyles, dO yet appeòr but Volatile ſalts; But to inſiſt on theſe things, were to repeat; and therefore I ſhall proceed This Diſparity is alſo highly eminent  the ſeparated ſulphurs or Chymical Ovles of things. For they conrain ſo much of the ſcent, and taſt, and vertues, uf the Bodies whene they were drawn, thit they feem m be bur ſie Material Crais Cit Imay ſo ſpeak) oſ their mon, Cloves, Nutmegs and other ſpices, ſeem to be but the United Aromatick parts that did ennoble thoſe Bodies. Andtis a known thing, that Oyl of Cinnamon, and ojle of Cloves, (which I have likewiſe obſervd in the Oyles of ſeveral Woods) will ſink to the Bottom of Water: whereas thoſe of Nutmegs and divers other Vegetables will ſim upon it. The Oyle (abuſively calld ſpirit) of Roſes ſwims at the Top of the Water In the forme of a white butter, which I remember not to have obſerv'd in any other Oyle drawn in any Limbeck3 yet there is a way (not here to be declard) by which I have ſeen it come over in the forme of other Aromatick Oyles, tothe Delight and Wonder of thoſe that beheld it. In Oyle of Anniſeeds, which I drew both with, and without Fermentation, I obſervd the whole Body of the Oyle in a coole place to thicken into the Conſiſtence and Appearanct of white Butter, which with the leaſt heat reſumd its Former Liquidneſs. In the Oylof Olive drawn over in a Retort, I have likewiſe more then once ſcen a ſpontaneous Coagulation in ihe Receiver: And I have of it by me thus Congeal’d3 which is of ſuch a ſtrangely Penetrating ſcent, as if twould Perforate the Noſes that approach ir. The like pungent Odour I alſo obſervd in the Diſtilld Liquor of common ſope, which forcd over from Minium, lately afforded an ojle of a moſt admirable Penetrancy 3 And he muſt be a great ſtranger, both to the Writings and preparations of Chymiſts, that ſees not in the Oyles they diſtill from Vegetables and Animals, a conſiderable and obvious Difference. Nay I ſhall venture to add, Eleutherius,  what perhaps you will think ofkin to a Paradox that divers times out of the ſame Animal or Vegetable, there may be extracted Oyles of Natures obviouſly differing. To which purpoſe I ſnall not inſiſt on the wimming and ſinking Oyles, which I have ſometimes obſervd to float on, and ſubſide under the ſpirit of Guajacum, and that of divers other Vegetables Diſtil'd with a ſtrong and laſting Fire3 Nor ſhall I inſiſt on the obſervation elſewhere mentiond, of the divers and unminglable oyles aſforded us by Humane Blood long fermemted and S Digeſted with ſpirit of Wine, becauſe theſe kind of oyles may ſeem chieſly to differ in Conſiltence and Weiglt, being all of them high colour'd and aduſt. But the Experiment which I devi'd to make out this Difference of the oyles of the ſame Vegetable, ad Oculum, C us they ſpeak) was this that followes. I took a pound of Anniſſceds, and having groſly beaten them, cauſcd them to be put into a very large glaſs Retort almoſt filled with fair Water; and placing this Retort in a ſand Furnace, Icaus'd a very Gentle heat to be adminiſterd during the firſi day, and a great part of the ſecond, till the VVater was for the moſt part drawn off, and had brought over withit at leaſt moſt of the Volatile and Aromatick Oyle of the ſeeds. And then encreaſing the Fire, and changing the Receiver, Iobtaid beſides an Empyreumatical Spirit, a quantity of aduſt oyle 3 whereofa little floated upon the Spirit, and the reſt was more heavy, and not eaſily ſeparable from it. And whereas theſe oyles were very dark, and ſmell'd  as Chymiſts ſpeak) ſo ſtrongly of the Fire, that their Odour did not betray from what Vegetables they had been ford; the othcr Aromatick Oyle was enriclvd with the genuine ſmell and taſt of the Concrete;and ſpontancouſly coagulating it ſelf into white butter did ma nifeſt ſelf to be the true Oyle of Anniſſceds; which Concrete I therefore choſe to employ about this Experiment, that the Difference of theſe Oyles might be more conſpicuous then it would have been, had Iinſtead of it deſtill'd another Vegetable. Ihad almoſt forgot to take notice, that there is another ſort of Bodies, which though not obtaind trom Concretes by Diſtillation, many Chymiſts are wont to call their Sulphur; not only becauſe ſuch ſubſtances are, for the moſt part, high colourd (whence they are alſo, and that more properly, called Tinctures) as diſſolvd Sulphurs are wont to be; but eſpecially becauſe they are, for the moſt part, abſtracted and ſeparated from the reſt of the Maſſc by Spirit of Wine: which Liquor thoſe men ſuppoſing to be Sulphureous, they conclude, that what it works upon, and abſtracts, muſt be a Sulphur alſo. And upon this account they preſume, that they can ſequeſter the ſulS phur even of Minerals and Metalls; ſrom which tis known that they cannot by Fire alone ſeparate it. To all This I ſmall anſwer;37 That if theſe ſequeſtred ſubſtances where indeed the ſulphurs of the Bodies whence they are drawn, there would as well be a preac Diſparity betwix: Chymical Sulphurs obtain'd by Spirit of Wine, as ſhave already ſhewn there is betwixt thoſe obtaind by Diſtillation in the forme of Oyles: which will be evident from hence, that not to urge that themſclves aſcribe diſtinct vertues to Mineral Tinctures, extolling the Tincture of Gold againſt ſuch and ſuch Diſeaſes; the Tincture of Antimony, or of its Glaſs, againſt orhers; and the Tincture of Emerauld againſt others;tis plain, that in Tinctures drawn from Vegetables, if the ſuperſluous ſpirit of Wine be diſtill'd off, it loaves at the bortom that thicker ſubſtance which Chymiſts uſe to call the Extract of the Vegetable. And that theſe Extracts are endowd with very differing Qualities according to the Nature of the Particular Bodies that afforded them ( though I fear ſeldom with ſo much of the ſpeciſick vertues as is wont to be imagind) is ſreely copſcſvd both by Phyſitians and Chymiſis. But, E leutherius, (ſayes Carneades) we may here take Notice that the Chymiſts do as well in this caſe, as in manyothers, allow thenſclves a Licenſe to abuſe Words: For not again to argue from the differing properties of Tinctures, that they are not exactly pure and Elementary Sulphurs; they would eafily appear not to be ſomuchas Sulphurs, although we ſhould allow Chvmical Oyles to deſerve that Name. For however in ſome Mineral Tinctures the Natural fixtneſs of the extracted Body does not alwayes ſuffer it to be eaſily ſurther reſoluble into differing ſubſtances3 Yet in very many extracts drawn from Vegetables, it may very eaſily be manifeſted that the ſpirit of Wine has not ſequeſtred the ſulphureous Ingredient from the ſalire n Mercurial ones3 but has diſſolvd ( for Itake ĩt to be a Solution) the ſiner Parts of the Concrete (without making any nice diſtinction of their being perfectly Sulphureous or not) and united it ſelf vith them into a kind of Magiſtery; which conſequently muft contain Ingredients or Parts of ſeveral ſorts. For we ſee that the ſtones that are richin vitriol, being oſten drencd with rain-Woater, the Liquor will then extract a finc and tranſparent ſubſtance coagulable into Vitriol; and yet though this Vitriol be readily diſſolũble in Water, it is not a true Elementary Salt, but, as You know, a body reſoluble into very differing Parts, whereof one ( as Iſhall have occaſion to tell You anon) is yet of a Metalline, and conſequently not of an Elementary Nature. You may conſider alſo, that common Sulphur is readily diſſoluble in Oyle of Turpentine, though notwithſtanding its Name it abounds as well, if not as much, in Salt as in true Sulphur ;3 witnels the great quantity of ſaline Liquor it afords be ing ſet to flame away undcr a glaſſe Bell. Nay Ihave, which per haps You will think ſtrange, with the ſame Oyle of Turpentine alone caſily enough diſſolvd crude Antimony ſinely powder d into a Blood-red Balſam, wherewith perhaps conſidcrable things may be performd in Surgery. And if it were now Requiſite, I could tell You of ſome other Bodies ( ſuch as Perhaps You would not ſuſpect) thatI have been able to work upon with certain Chymical Oyles. But inſtead of digreſſing ſurther I ſhall make this uſe of the Example have nanrd. Thattis not unlikely, but that Spirit of Wine which by its pungent taſt, and by ſome other Qualities that argue it better (eſpecially ĩits Reducibleneſſe, according to Helmont, into Alcali, and Water,) ſeems to be as well of a Saline as of a Sulphureous Nature, may well be ſuppos'd Capable of Diſſolving Subſtances That are not meerly Elementary ſulphurs, though perhaps they may abound with Parts that are of kin thereunto. For I find that Spirit of Wine will diſſolve Gumm Lacca, Benoine, and the Reſinous Parts oſ TJallap, and even ot Guaiacum; whence we may well ſuſpect that it may from Spices, Herbs, and other leſſe compacted Vegetables, extract ſubſtances that are not perfect Sulphurs but mixt Bodies. And to put it paſt Diſpute, there is many a Vulgar Extract drawn with Spirit of Wine, which committed to Diſtillation will afford ſuch differing ſubſtances as will Loudly proclaim it to have been a very compounded Body. So that we may juſtly ſuſpect, that even in Mineral Tinctures it will not alaies follo, that becauſe a red ſubſtance is drawn ſrom the Concrete by ſpirit of Weine, that Subſtance is its ttue and Elementary Sulphur. And though ſome of theſe Extracts may perhaps be inflamable 3 Yet beſides that others are not, and beſides that their being reduc'd to ſuch Minuteneſs bf Parts may much facilitate their tabing Fire; beſides this, I ſay, We ſee that common Sulphur, common Oyle, Gumm Lac, and many Unctuous and Reſinous Bodies, ill flame well enough, though they be of very compounded natures: Nay Travellers of Unſuſpected Credit aſſure Us, as a known thing, that in ſome Northern Countries where Firr trees and Pines abound, the poorer ſort of Inhabitants uſe Long ſplinters of thoſe Reſinous Woods to burne inſtead of Candles. And as for the redneſſe wont to be met with in ſuch ſolutions, I could eaſily ſhew, thattis not neceſſary ĩt ſnould proceed from the Sulphur of the Concrete, Diſſolv'd by the Spirit of Wine; if I had leaſure to manifeſt. how much Chymiſts are wont to delude themſelves and others by the Ignorance of thoſe other cauſes upon whoſe accoumt ſpirit of Wine and other Menſtruums may acquire t red or ſome other high colour. Bur to returne to our Chymical Oyles, ſuppoſing that they were exactly pure3 Yet Ihope they would be, as the beſt ſpirit of Wine is, but the more inflamable and deflagrable. And therefore ſince an Oyle can be by ihe Fire alone immediately turm'd into flame, which is ſomething of a very differing Nature ſfromit : I ſhall Demand how this Oyle can be a Primogeneal ænd Incorruptible Body, as moſt Chymiſis would have their Principles; Since it is further reſoluble into flame, which whether or no it be a portion of the Element of Fire, as an Ariftotelian would conclude, is certainly ſomething of a very differing Nature from a Chymical Oyle, ſince it Burmcs and ſhines, and mounts ſiſily upwards 3 none of which a Chymical Oyle does, whilſt it continues ſuch. And ifit ſnould be Objected, that the Diſſipated Paris of this flaming Oyle e caught and collected again into Oyl or Sulphur; I ſhall demand, what Chymiſt appears to have ever done it3; and without Examining whether it may not hence be as well ſaid that ſulphur is but compacted Fire, as that Fire is ur diffus'd Sulphur, I ſhall leave you to conſider whether it may not hence be argu d, that neither Fire nor Sulphur are primitive and inde ſtructible Bodies; and I ſhall ſurther obſerve that, at leait it will hence appear that a portion of matter may without being Compounded with new Ingredients, by having the Texture and Motion of its ſmall parts changd, be caſily, by the means of the Fire, endowd with new Qualities, more differing from them it had before, then are thoſe which ſuſfice to diſcriminate the Chymiſts Principles from one another. We are next to Conſider, whether in the Anatomy of mixt Bodies, that which Chymiſts call the Mercurial part of them be un-compounded, or no. But to tell You True, though Chymiſts do Unanimouſly aſfiro that their Reſolutions diſcover a Principle, which they call Mercury, yet Ifind them to give of it Deſcriptions ſo Difſering, and ſo  nigmaticall, that I, who am not aſhamd to confeſs that I cannot underſtand what is not ſence, muſt acknowledge to you that I know not what to make of them. Paracelſis himſelf, and therefore, as you will eaſily believe, many of his Followers, does ſomewhere callthat Mercury which aſcends upon the burning of Wood, as the Peripateticks are wont to take the ſame ſmoke for Air; and ſo ſeems to define Mercury by Volatility, or (if I may coyne ſuch a Word) Effumability. But ſince, in this Example, both Voſatile Salt and Sulphur make part of the ſmoke, which does indeed conſiſt alſo borh of Phlegmatick and Terrene Corpuſcles, this Notion is not to be admirted; And I find that the more ſober Chymiſts themſelves diſavow it. Yet to ſiew you how little of clearneſs we are to expect in the accounts even of latter Spagyriſis, be pleas'd to take notice, that Beguinus, even in his Tyrocinium Chymicum, written for the Inſtruction of Novices, when he comes to tell us hat are meant by the Tria Prima, which for theit being Principles ought to be defind the more accurately and plainly, gives us this Deſcription of Mercury 3 Mercurius (ſayes he) est liquor ille acidus, permeabilis, penetrabilis, æihereus, ac purigſimus, a quo omnis Nutricatio, Senſu, Motus, Vires, tio. Which words are not ſo mucha Definition of it, as an Encomium: and yet Quercetanus in his Deſcription of the ſame Principle adds to theſe, divers other Epithets. But both of them, to skip very many other faults that may be found with their Metaphoricall Deſcriptions, ſpeak incongruouſly to the Chymiſts own Principles. For if Mercury be an Acid Liquor, either Hermetica] Philoſophy muſt err in aſcribing all Taſts to Salt, or elſe Mercury muit not be a Principle, but Compounded of a Saline Ingredient and ſomewhat elſe. Libavius, though he ſind great fault with the obſcurity of what the Chymiſts write concerning their Mercurial Principle, does yet but give us ſuch a Negative Deſcription of it, as Sennertus, how favourable ſoever to the Tria Prima, is not ſatisdd with. And this Sennertus Himſelf, though the Learnedſt Champion for the Hypoſtatical Principles, does almoſt as frequently as juſtly complain of the unſatifactorineſs of what the Chymiſts teach concerning their Mercury; and yer he himſelf (but with his wonted modeſty) Subſtitutes inſtcad of the Deſcription of Libavius, another, which many Readers, eſpecially if they be not Peripateticks, will not know what to make of. For ſcarce telling us any more, then that in all bodies that which is found beſides Salt and Sulphur, and the Elements, or, as they call them, Phlegm and- Dead Earth, is that Spirit which in Aristorles Language may be calld olar à d&o? " W ſ,00 Foixæin. He ſayes that which I confeſs is not at all ſatisfactory to me, who do not love to ſeem to acquieſce in any mans Myſtical Doctrines, that Imay be thought to underſtand them. If C ſayes Eleutherius) I durſt preſume that the ſame thing would be thought clear by me, and thoſe that are fond of ſuch cloudy Expreſſions as You juſtly Tax the Chymiſis for, I ſould venture to offer to Conſideration, whether or no, ſince the Mercurial Principle that ariſes from Diſtillation is unanimouſly aſſerted to be diſtinct from the ſalt and Sulphur of the ſame Concrete, that may not be callld the Mercury of a Body, which though it aſcend in Diſtillation, as do the Pſlegme and Sulphur, is neither mable like the latter. And thereſoreI would ſubſtitute to the too much abuſed Name of Mercury, the more clear and Familiar Appellation of Spirit, which is alſo now very much made uſe of even by the Chymiſts themſelves, of our times, though they have not given us ſo Diſtinct an Explication, as were fit, of what may be call/d the Spirit of a mixt Body. I ſhould not perhaps ( ſayes Carneades) much quarrel with your Notion of Mercury. But as for the Chymiſis, what they can mean, with congruity to their own Principles, by the Mercury of Animals and Vegetables,twill not be ſo eaſie to find out; for they aſcribe Taſts only to the saline Principle, and conſequently would be much put to it to ſhew what Liquor it is, in the Reſolution of Bodies, that not being inſipid, for that they call Phlegme, neither is inflamable as Oyle or Sulphur, nor has any Taſt; Which according to them muſt proceed from a Mixture, at leaſt, of Salt. And if we ſhould take Spirit in the ſence of the Word receivd among Modern Chymiſts and Phyſitians, for any Diſtill'd Liquor that is neither Phlegme nor oyle, the Appellation would yet appear Ambiguous enough. For, plainly, that which firſt aſcends in the Diſtillation of Wine and Fermented Liquors, is generally as well by Chymiſts as others reputed a Spirit. And yet pure Spirit of Wine being wholly inflamable ought according to them to be reckond to the Sulphureous, not the Mercurial Principle. And among the other Liquors that go under the name of Spirits, there are divers hich ſcem to belong to the family of Salts, ſuch as are the Spirits of Nitre, Vitriol, Sca-Salt and others, and even the Spirit of Harts- horn, being, as Ihave tryd, in great part, if not totally reducible into salt and Phlegme, may be ſuſpected to be but a Volatile Salt disguis'd by the Phlegme mingd with it into the forme of a Liquor. However if this be a Spirit, it maniſeſtly difſers very much ſrom that of Vinager, the Taſt of the one being Acid, and the other Salt, and their Mixture incaſe they be very pure, ſometimes occaſioning an Efferveſcence like that of thoſe Liquors the Chym:ſts count moſt contrary to one another. And cven amon thoſe Liquors that ſcom to have a better title then thoſe hitherto mentiond, to the name of Spirits, there appears a ſenſible Diverſity 3 For ſpirit of Oak, for inſtance, differs from that of Tartar, and this from that of Box, or of Guaiacum. And in ſhort,even theſe ſpirits as well as other Diſtilld Liquors manifeſt a great Diſparity betwixt themſelves, either in their Actions on our ſenſes, or in their other operations. And (continues Corneades) beſides this Diſpaiity that is to be met with among thoſe Liquors that the Modernes call ſirits, & take for ſimilar bodies, what I have formerly told you concerning the Spirit of Box-wood may let you ſee that ſome of thoſe Liquors not only have qualities very differing from others, but may be further reſolved into ſubſtances differing from one another. And ſince many moderne Chymiſts and other Naturaliſts are pleaſcd to take the Mercurial ſpirit of Bodies for the ſame Principle, under differing names, Imuſt invite you to obſerve, with me, the great difference that is conſpicuous betwixt all the Vegetable and Animal ſpitits I have mentiond and ; Mercury. I ſpeak not of that whichis commonly ſold in ſhops that many of themſelves will confeſſe to be a mixt Body 3 but o that which is ſeparated from Metals, which by ſome Chymiits that ſeem more Philoſophers then the reſt, and eſpecially by the above mentioncd Claveus, is (for diſtinction ſake) called Mercurius Corporum. Now this Metalline Liquor being one of thoſe three Principles of which Mineral Bodies are by Spagyriſis aſfirmed to be composd and to be reſoluble into them, the many notorious Differences betwixt them and the Mercuries, as They call Them, of Vegetables and Animals will allow me to inferr, either that Mincrals and the other two ſorts of Mixt Bodies conſiſt not of the ſame Elements, or that thoſc Principles whereinto Mincrals are immediately reſolved, which Chymiſts with great oſtentation ſhew us as the true principles, of them, are but Secundary Principles, or Mixts of a peculiar ſorr, which muſt be themſelves reduc'd toa very differing forme, tobe ofthe ſame kind with Vegetable and Animal Liquors. But this is not all; for although IferT merly told You how Little Credit there is to be given to the Chymical Proceſſes commonly to be met with, of Extracting the Mercuries of Metals, Yet I will now add, that ſuppoſing that the more Judiciotis of Them do not untruly affirme that they have really drawn true and running Mercury from ſeveral Metals ( which Iwiſh they had cleerly taught Us how to do alſo,) yet it may be ſtill doubted whether ſuch extracted Mercuries do not as well differ from common Quickſilver, and from one another, as from the Mercuries of Vegetables and Animalls. Claveus, in his Apology, ſpeaking of ſome autem de argento vivo a me- experiments whereolicito, qurd vulgare ob ri- . igiditatem & humiditatem by Metalline Merconcotioni eſt contumax,nec curies may be fixt ſoturæ apeti Pinio the nobler metals, adds, that he ſpake of the Mercuries drawn from metals; becauſe common Quickſilver by reaſon of its exceſſive coldneſſe and moiſture is unfit for that particular kind of operation; for which thougha few lines before he preſcribes in general the Mercurics of Metalline Bodies, yet he chiefly commends that drawn by ars ſrom ſilur And elſewhere, in the ſame Book, he tells us, that he himſelf tryed, that by bare coction the quickſilver of Tin or Pewter ( argen um vivum ex ſtanno prolicitum may by an efficient cauſe, as he ſpeaks, be turn'd into pure Gold. And the Experiencd Alexander van Suchten, ſomewhere tells us, that by a way he intimates may be made a Mercuty of Copper, not of the Silver colour of other Merciries, but green; to which I ſhall add, that an eminent perſon, whoſe name his travells and learned writings have made famous, lately aſſurd me that he had more then once ſeen the Mercury of Lead  which what ever Authors promiſe, you will find it very difficult to make, at leaſt in any conſiderable quantity) fixt into perfect Gold. And being by me demanded whetheror no any other Mercury would not as well have been changed by the ſame Operations, he aſſured me of the Negative. And ſince Iam fallen upon the mention of the Mercuries oſmetals, you ill perhaps expect Eleutherius1) that I ſhould ſay ſomething of their two other principles; butI muſi freely confeſs to you, that what Diſparity there may be be2 tween the ſalts and ſulphurs of Metals and other Menerals, I am not my ſel experienced enough in the ſeparations and examens of them, to venture to determine: (for as for the ſalts of Metals, I formerly repreſented it as a thing much to be queſtion'd, whether they have any atall:) And for the proceſſes of ſeparation I find in Authors, if they were (What many of them are not) ſuccelsſully practicable, as I noted above, yet they are to bæ performed by the aſſiſtance of other bodies, ſo hardly, if upon any termes at all, ſeparable from them, thatit is very difficult to give the ſeparated principles all their duẽ, and no more. But the Sulphur of Antimony which is vehemently vomitive, and the ſtrongly ſconted Anodyne Sulphur of Vitriol inclines me to think that not only Mineral Sulphurs differ from Vegetable ones, but alſo from one another, retaining much of the nature oftheir Concretes. The ſalts of metals, and of ſome ſort of minerals, You will eaſily gueſſe by the Doubts I formerly oꝶbũ. whether metals have any ſalt at all, that T have not been ſo happy as yet to ſee, perhaps not for want of curioſity. But if Paracelſus did alwaies write ſo conſentaneouſly to himſelf that his opinion were confidently to be collectcd from every place of his ritings where he ſeems to expreſſe ir, I might ſaſely take upon me totell you, that he both countenances in general what I have delivered in my Fourth main conſideration, and in particular warrants me to ſuſpect that there may be a difference in metalline and mineral Salts, as well as we find it in thoſe of orher bodies. For, Sulphur (ſayes he) aliud in auro, aliud in argento, aliud in ferro, aliud in plumbo, ſtanno, &c. ſic aliud in Saphiro, aliud in Smoragdo, aliud in rubino, chryſolito, amethisto, magnete, &c. Item aliud in lapidibus, ſilice, ſalibus, fontibus, &c. nec vero tot ſulphura tantum,ſed & totidem ſulia ; ſalaliud in metallis, aliud in gemmis, aliud in lapidibas, aliud in ſalibus, aliud in vitriolo, aliud in alumine: ſimilis etiam Mercurii eſt ratio. Alius in Metallis, alim in Gemmis, &e. Ita ut unicuique ſpeciei ſuus peculiaris Mercuriu ſit. Et tamen res ſaltem tres ſunt 3 una eſſentia est ſulphur 3 una eſt ſal3 unaeſt Mercurius. Addo quod & ſpecialius adhuc ſingula dividantur 3 aurum enim non unum,ſed multiplex,ut et non unum pyrum,pomum,ſed idem multiplex; totidem eT tiam ſulphura asri,ſalia auri, mercurii auri3 idem competit etiam metallis & gemmis 3 ut quot ſaphyri praſtantiores, Leviores, &c. tot etiam ſaphyrica ſulyhura, ſaphyrica ſalia, ſaphyrici Mercurii, &c. Idem verum etiam eſt de turconibus & gemmis aliis univerſis. From which paſſage  Eleutherius) I ſuppoſe you will think I might without rarhneſs conclude, either that my opinion is favoured by that of Paracelſus, or that Paracelſus his opinion was not alwaies the ſame. But becauſe in divers other places of his writings he feems to talk at a differing rate of the three Principles and the four Elements, I ſhall content my ſelf to inferr from the alledgd paſſage, that if his doctrine be not conſiſtent with that Part of mino which it is brought to countenance, it is very difficult to know what his opinion concerning ſalt, ſulplur and mercury, was ;3 and that conſequently we had reaſon about the beginning of our conferences, to decline taking upon us, cither to examine or oppoſe it. Iknow not whether I ſhould on this occaſion add, that thoſe very bodies the Chymiſts call Phlegme and Earth do yer recede from an Elementary ſimplicte. That common Earth and Water frequently do ſo, norwithſtanding the received contrary opinion, is not deny'd by the more vary of the moderne Peripatetics themſelves: and certainly, moſt Earths are much leſſe ſimple bodies then is commonly imagined even by Chymiſts, who do not ſo conſideratly to preſcribe and employ Earths Promiſcuouſly in thoſe diſtillations thar require the mixture of ſome caput mortuum, to hinder the flowing together of the matter, and to retain ĩts groſſer parts. For I have found ſome Earths to yield by diſtillation a Liquor very far from being inodorous or inſipid; and tis a known obſervation, that moſt kinds of fat Earth kept coverd from the rain, and hindred from ſpending themſelves in the production ofvegetables, will in time become impregnated with Salt. Petre. But I muſt remember that the Water and Earths Iought here to ſpeak of, are ſuch as are ſeparated from mixt Bodies by the fire3 and thereſore to reſtrain my Diſcourſe to ſuch, I ſhall tell you, That we ſee the Phlegme of Vitriol ( for inſtance) is a very effectual remedie againſt burnes3 and I know a very FaT mous and experiencd Plyfitian, vhoſe unſuſpected ſecret (himſelf confeſsd to me) it is, for the diſcuſſing of hard and Obſtinate Tumours. The Phlegme of Vinager, though drawn exceeding leaſurly in a digeſting Furnace, I have purpoſely made tryall of; and ſometimes found it able to draw, though ſlowly, a ſaccharine ſweetneſs out of Lead; and as I remember by long Digeſtion, I diſſolvd Corpals in it. The Phlegme of the ſugar of Saturne is ſaid to have very peculiar properties. Divers Eminent Chymiſts teach, that it will diſſolve Pearls, which being precipitated by the ſpirit of the ſame concrete are thereby (as they ſay) rendred volatile;which has been confirmed to me, upon his own obſervation, by a perſon of great veracity. The Phlegme of Wine, and indeed divers other Liquors that are indiſcriminately condemnd to be caſt away as phlegm, are endowd withqualities that make them differ both rom meer water, and from eachother; and whereas the Chymiſis are pleas'd to call the caput mortuum of what they have diſtilld Caſter they have by affuſion of water drawn avay its ſalt) terra damnata, or Earth, it may be doubted whether or no thoſe earths are all of them perfectly alike: and it is ſcarce to be doubted, but that there are ſome of them which remain yet unreducd to an Elementary nature. The aſhes of wood deprivd of all the ſalt, and bone- Aſhes, or calcind Hartshorn, which Refiners chooſe to make Teſts of, as freeſt from Salt, ſeem unlike:and he that ſhall compare either oſtheſe inſipid aſhes to Lime, and much more to the calx of Talk (hough by the aſfuſion of water they be exquiſitely dulcifyd) ill perhaps ee cauſe 1o think them things of a ſomewhat differing naure. Andĩt is evident in Colcothar that the exacteſt calcination, follod by an exquiſite dulcification, does not alaies reduce the remaining body into elementary earth;ſor aſter the ſalt or Vitriol (if the Calcination have been too faint) is drawn out of the Colcothar, the reſidue is not earth, but a mixt body, rich in Medical vertues ( as experience has informdme) and which Angelus Sala affirmes to be partly reducible into malleable Copper; which I judge very probable: for though when I was making Experiments upon Colcothar, I was deſtitute of a Furnace capable of giving a heat intenſe Enough to bring ſue a Calx to Fuſion; yet having conjecturd that if Colcothar abounded with that Metal, Aqua Fortis would find it out there, I put ſome dulcifi'd Colcothar into that Menſtruum, and found the Liquor, according to my Expectation, preſently Colourd as Highly as if it had been an Ordinary Solution of Copper. 46&I6689aI- —————— m—————————;— — BASRARGOR2ROuASSS 2uS ? ſ ſES SRE/I, t 5t4 vœr;;;;œbσ?vσ THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The F ifib Parit. Ere Carneades making a pauſe, I muſt not deny (ſayes his Friend to him) that Ithink You have ſufficiently provd that theſe diſtinct Subſtances which Chymiſts are wont to obtain from Mixt Bodies, by their Vulgar Deſtillation, are not pure and ſimple enough to deſerve, in Rigour of ſpeaking, the Name of Elements, or Principles. But I ſuppoſe You have heaerd, that there are ſome Modern sparyiſis, who give out that they can by further and more Skilſull Purifications, ſo reduce the ſeparated Ingredients of Mixt Bodies to an Elementary fimplicity, That the Oyles ( for Inſtance) extracted from all Mixts ſhall as perfectly reſemble one another, as the Drops of Water do. If you remember (replies Carneades) that at the Beginning of our Conſcrence with Philoponus, I declard to him before the reſt of the Company, that I would not engage my ſelf at preſent to do any more then examine the uſual proots allcdg'd by Chymiſts, for the Vulgar doctrine of their three Hypoſtatical Principles; You will eaſily perceive that Iam not obli?'d to make anſwer to what you newly proposd; and that it rather grants, then diſproves what I have been contending for: Since by pretending to make ſo great a change in the reputed Principles that Deſtillation affords the common Spagyrifis, tis plainly enough preſupposd, that before ſuch Artificial Depurations be made, the Subſtances to be made more ſimple were not yet ſimple enough to be look'd upon as Elementary; Wherefore in caſe the Artiſis you ſpeak of could perform what they give out they can, yet I ſhould not need to be aſhamd of having queſtionnd the Vulgar Opinion touching the tria Prima. And as to the thing it ſelf, Iſhall ſreely acknowledge to ſu that I love not to be forward in determining things to be impoſſible, till I know and have conſiderd the means by which they are propos'd to be effected. And therefore Iſhall not peremptorily deny either the poſſibility of what theſe Artiſis promiſe, or my Aſſent to any juſt Inference; however deſtructive to my Conjectures, that may be drawn from their performances. But give me leave to tell you withall, that becauſe ſuch promiſes are wont (as Experience has more then once informd me) to be much more eaſily made, then made good by Chymiſis, I muſt withhold my Belieſe ſrom their aſſrtions, till their Experiments cxact it; and muſt not be ſo eaſie as to expect before hand, an unlikely thing upon no ſtronger Inducements then are yet given me: Beſides that Ihave not yet found by what Ihave heard of theſe Artiſis, that though they pretend to bring the ſeveral Subſtances into which the Fire has divided the Concrete, to an exquiſite ſimplicity, They pretend alſo to be able by the Fire to divide all Concretes, Minerals, and others, into the ſame number of Diſtinct Subſtances. And in the mean time I muſt think it improbable, that they can either truly ſeparate as many differing Bodies ſrom Gold ( for Inſtance) or Oſtecolla, as we can do from Wine, or Virriol; or that the Mercury (for Example) of Gold or Saturn would be perfectly of the ſame Nature with that of Hartshorn;3 and that the ſulphur of Antimony would be but Numerically different from the Diſtil'd butter or oyle of Roes. But ſuppoſe ſayes Eleutherius) that you ſhould meet with Chymiſts, who would allow you to take in Earth and Water into the number of the principles of Mixt Bodies; and being alſo content to change the Ambiguous Name oſ Mercury for that more intelligible one of ſpirit, ſhould conſequently make the principles of Compound Bodies to be Five3 would you not think ĩt ſomething hard to reject ſo plauſible an Opinion, only becauſe the Five ſubſtances into which the Fire divides mixt Bodies are not exactly pure, and Homogeneous ? For my part ( Continues Corneades) I cannot but think it ſomewhat ſtrange, in caſe this Opinion be not true, that it ſhonld fall out ſo luckily, that ſo great a Variety of Bodies ſnould be Analy2d by the Fire into juſt five Diſtinct ſubſtances; which ſo little differing from the Bodies that bear thoſe names, may ſo Plaufibly be call'd Oyle, Spirit, Salt, Water, and Earth. The Opinion You now propoſe (anſwers Carneades) being another then that I was engagd to examine, itis not requiſite for me to Debate it at preſent3 nor ſhould I have leiſure to do it thorowly. Wherefſore I ſnall only tell you in General, that though Ithink this Opinion in ſome reſpects more defenſible then that of the Vulgar Chymiſts;yet you may eaſily enough learn from the paſt Diſcourſe what may be thought of it: Since many of the Objections made againſt the Vulgar Doctrine of the Chymiſts ſeem, without much alteration, employable againſt this Hypotheſis alſo. For, beſides that this Doctrine does as well as the other take it for granted, (what is not eaſie to be ꝶ that lvzer of Bodies, and that all the Diſtint ſubſtances obtainable ſrom a mixt Body by the Fire, were ſo pre-exiſtent init, that they were but extricated from cach other by the Analyſis; Beſides that this Opinion, too, aſcribe to the Productions of the Fire an Elementary ſimplicity, which I have ſnewn not to belong to them; and beſides that this Doctrine is lyable to ſome of the other Difficultics, wherewith That of the Tria Prima is incumberd; Beſides all this, Iſay, this quinary number of EJements, (if you pardon the Expreſion) ought at leaſt to have been reſtraind to the Generality of Animal and Vegetable Bodies, ſince not only among theſe there are ſome Bodies (as I formerly argud) which, for ought has yet been made to appear, do conſiſt, either of fewer or more ſimilar ſubſtances then preciſely Five. But in the Mineral Kingdom, there is ſcarce one Concrete that has been evinc'd to be adequatly diviſible into ſuch five Principles or Elements, and neither more nor leſs, as this Opinion would have every mixe Body to conſiſt of. neades) may ſerve to take away or leſſen your Wonder, that juſt ſò many Bodies as five ſhould bè found upon the Reſolution of Concretes. For ſince we find not that the fire can make any ſuch Analyſis C into five Elements) of Metals and other Mineral Bodies , whoſe Texture is more ſtrong and permanent, it remains that the Five Subſtances under conſideration be Obtaind ſrom Veetable and Animal Bodies, which (probly by reaſon of their Iooſer Contexiure) are capable of being Diſtill/d. And as to ſuch Bodies, tis natural enough, that, whether we ſuppoſe that there are, or are not, preciſely five Elements, there ſhould ordinarily occurr in the Diſſipated parts a five Fold Diverſity of Scheme (if I may ſo ſ eak.) For if the Parts do not remain all fixd, as in Gold, Calcind Talck, &c. nor all aſcend, as in the Sublimation of Brimſtone, Camphire, &c. but aſter their Diſſipation do aſſociate themſelves into new Schemes of Matter; it is very likely, that they will by the Fire be divided into fixd and Volatile (I mean, in Reference to that degree of heat by which they are deſtil'dJ and thoſe Volatie parts will, for the moſt part, aſcend either in a dry forme, which Chymiſts are pleasd to call, if they be Taſtleſs, Flowers; if Sapid, Volatile Salt ;or in a Liquid Forme. And this Liquor muſt be eĩther inflamable, and ſo paſs ſor oyl, or not inſlamable, and yet ſubtile and pungent, which may be call'd Spirit or elſe ſtrengthleſs or inſipid, which may be namd Phlegme, or Water. And as for the fixt part, or Caput Mortuum, it will moſt commonly conſiſt of Corpuſcles, parly Soluble in Water, or Sapid, ( eſpecially if the Saline parts were not ſo Volatile, as to fly aay before) which make up its fixt ſalt;and partly inſoluble and inſipid, which therefore ſeems to challenge the name of Earth. But although upon this ground one might eaſily enough have foretold, that the differing ſubſtances obtain'd ſrom a perfectly mixt Bodyby the Fire would for the moſt part be reducible to the five newly mentioned States of Matter; yet it will not preſently follow, that theſe five Diſtinct ſubſtances were ſimple and primogeneal bodies, ſo preexiſtent in the Concrete that the fire does but take them aſunder. Beſises that it does not appear, that all Mixt Bodies, (witneſs, Gold, Silver, Mercury, &c.) Naynor perhaps all Vegetables, which may appear by what we ſaid above of Camphire, Benæoin, c. are reſoluble by Fire into juſt ſuch diſfering Schemes of Matter. Nor vill the Experiments formerly alledęd permit us to look upon theſe ſeparated Subſtances as Elementary, or uncompounded. Neither will it be a ſufficient Argument of their being Bodics that deſerve the Names whicli Chymiſts are pleas'd to give them, that they have an Analogy in point of Conſiſtence, or either Volatility or Fixtneſs, or elſe ſome other obvious Quality, with the ſuppos'd Principles, whoſe names ere aſcribd to them. For, as I told you above, notwithſtanding this Reſemblance in ſome one Quality, there may be ſuch a Diſparity in others, as may be more fit to give them Differing Appellations, then the Relemblance is to give them one and the ſame. And Indeed it ſeems but ſomewhat a groſs Way of judging of the Nature of Bodies, to conclude without Scruple, that thoſe muſt be of the ſame Nature that agrec in ſome ſuch General Quality, as Fluidity, Dryneſs, Volatility, and the like: ſince each of thoſe Qualities, or States ot Matter, may Comprehend a great Variety of Bodies, otherwiſe oſ a very differing Naure ; as we may ſce in the Calxes of Gold, of Vitriol, and of Venetian Talck, compar d with common Aſhes, which yet are very dry, and fix'd by the vehemence of the Fire, as well as they. And as we may likewiſe gather from what Ihave formerly Obſervd, touching the Spirit of Box-Wood, which though a Volatile, Sapid, and not inflamable Liquor, as well as the Spiriis of Harts- horn, of Blood and others, (and therefore has been hitherto calld, the Spirit, and eſteemd for one of the Principles of the Wood that affords it;) may yer, as I told You, be ſubdivided into two Liquors, differing from one another, and one of them at leait, from the Generality of other Chymical Spirits. But you may your ſclf, if you pleaſe, ( purſucs Carneades) accommodate to the Hypotheſis you proposd what other particulars you ſhall think applicable to it, in the foregoing Diſcourſe. Forl think it unſcaſonable for me to meddle now any further with a Controverſie, which ſince it docs not no belong to me, Leaves me at Liberty to Take my Own time to Declare my Self about it. Eleutherius perceiving that Carneades was ſomewhat unwilling to ſpend any more time upon the debate of this Opinion, and having perhaps ſome thoughts of taking hence a Riſe to make him Diſcourſe it more fully another time, thought not fit as then to make any further mention to him of the propos'd opinion, but told him; I preſume I necd not mind you, Carneades, That both the Patrons of the ternary number of Principles, and thoſe that would have five Elements, endeavour to back theit experiments with a ſpecious Reaſon or two; and eſpecially ſome of thoſe Embracers of the Opinion laſt namd  whom I have conversd with, and found them Learned men) aſſizne this Reaſon of the neceſſity of five diſtinct Elements; that otherwiſe mixt Bodies could not be ſo compounded and temperd as to obiain a due conſiu ſtence and competent Duration. For Salt (ſay they) is the Baſis of Solidity; and Permanency in Compound Bodies, without which the other four Elements might indeed be variouſly and looſly blended togerher, but would remain incompacted; but that Salt might be diſſolvd into minute Parts, and conveyd to the other Subſtances to be compacted by it, and withit, there is a Neceſſity of Woater. And that the mixture may not be too hard and brittle, a Sulphureous or Oyly Principle muſt intervene to make the maſs more tenacious; to this a Mcrcurial ſpirit muſt be ſuperadded; which by its activity may fora while premeate, and as it were leaven the whole Maſi, and thereby promote the more exquiſite mixture and incorporation of the Ingredients. To all which ( laſtly) a portion of Earth muſt be added, which by its drineſſe and poracity may ſoak up part of that water wherein the Salt was diſſolvd, and eminently concurr with the other ingredients to give the whole body the requiſite conſiſtence. I perceive (ſayes Carneades ſmiling) that if it be true, astwas lately rooted from the Proverb, That good Wits hen Lad Memories, You have that Title, as well as a better, to a place among the good Wits. For you have already more then once forgot, that I declard to you that I would at this Conference Examine only the Experiments of my Adverſaries, not their Speculative Reaſons. Yettis not ( Subjoynes Carneades) for fear of medling with the Argument you have proposd, that I decline the examining it at preſent. For if when we are more at leaſure, you ſnall have a mind that ve may Solemnly conſider of it together;3T am confident we ſnall ſcarce find ĩt inſoluble. And in the mean time we may obſerve, that ſuch a way of Arguing may, it ſeems, be ſpeciouſly accommodated to differing Hypotheſes. For I find that Beguinus, and other Aſſrtors of the Tria Prima, pretend to make out by ſuch a way, the requiſiteneſs of their Salr, Sulphur and Mercury, to conſtitute mixt Bodies, withour taking notice of any neceſſity of an Addition or Water and Earth. And indeed neither ſort of Chymiſts ſeem to have duly conſiderd how great Variety there is in the Textures and Conſiftences of Compound Bodie;san how little the conſiſtence and Duration of many of them ſeem to accommodate and be explicable by the propos'd Notion. And not to mention thoſe almoſt incorruptible Subſtances obtainable by the Fire, which I have prov'd to be ſomewhat compounded, and which the Chymiſts will readily grant not to be perfectly mixt Bodies: (NOt to mention theſe, I ſay) If vou will but recall to mind ſome of thoſe Experiments, whereby I ſnew'd You that out of common Water only mixt Bodies (and cven living ones) of very differing conſiltences, and reſoluble by Fire into as many Principles as other bodies acknowledg]d to be perfectly mixt; if you do this, I ſay, you will not, I ſuppoſe, be avcrſe from beleeving, that Nature by a convenient diſpoſition of the minute parts of a portion of matter may contrive bodies durable enough, and of this, or that, or the other Conſiſtence, without being obligd to make uſe of all, much leſs of any Determinate quantity of cach of the five Elements, or of the three Principles to compound ſuch ades) ſomething wonderd, Chymiſis ſhould not conſider, that there is ſcarce any body in Nature ſo permanent and indiſſoluble as Glaſs 3 which yet themſelves teach us may be made of bure Aſnes, brought to fuſion by the meer Violence of the Fire; ſo that, ſince Aſhes are granted to conſiſt but of pure Salt and ſimple Earth, ſequeſtred from all the other Principles or Elements, they muſt acknowledge, That even Att it ſelf can of two Elements only, or, if you pleaſe, one Principle and one Element, compound a Body more durable then almoſt any in the World. Which being undeniable, how will they prove that Nature cannot compound Mixt Bodies, and even durable Ones, under all the ſive Elements or material Principles. But to inſiſt any longer on this Occaſional Diſquiſition, Touching their Opinion that would Eſtabliſ five Elements, were to remember as little as You did before, that the Debate of this matter is no part of my firſt undertaking ; and conſequently, that I have already ſpent time enough in whatI look back upon but as a digreſſion,or at beſt an And thus, Eleutberius, C ſayes Carreades) having at length gone through the four Conſiderations I proposd to Diſcourſe unto you, Ihold it not unfit, for fear my having inſiſted ſo long on each of them may have made you forget their Series, brieſly to repeat them by telling you, that Since, in the firſt place, it may juſtlybe doubted whether or no the Fire be, as Chymiſts ſuppoſe it, the genuine and Univerſal Reſolver of mixt Bodies3 Sinec we may doubt, in the nexe place, whether or no all the Diſtinct Subſtances that may be obtain'd from a mixt body by the Fire were pre-exiftent there in the formes in which they were ſeparated fromit; Since alſo, though we ſhould grant the Subſtances ſeparable from mixt Bodies by the fire to have been their component Ingredients, yet the Number of ſuch ſubſtances does not appear the ſame in all mixt Bodies; ſome of them being Reſoluble into more differing ſubſtances than three, and Others not being Reſoluble into ſo manyas three.: And Since, Laſtly, thoſe very ſubſtances moſt part pure and Elementary bodies, but new kinds of mixts; Since, Iſay, theſe things are ſo,] hope vou will allow me to inferr, that the Vulgar Experiments (I might perchance have Added, the Arguments :oo) wont to be Alledgd by Chymiſts to prove, that their three Hypoſtatical Principles do adequately compoſe all mixt Bodies, are not ſo demonſtrative as to reduce a wary Perſon to acquieſce in their Doctrine, which, till they Explain and prove it better, willby its perplexing darkneſs more apt to puzzle then ſatisfy conſidering men, and will to them appear incumbred with no ſmall Difficulties. And from what has been hitherto deduc'd ( continues Carneades) we may Learn, what to Judge of the common Practice of thoſe Chymiſts, who becauſe they have found thai Diverſe compound Bodies (for it ill not hold in AllD can be reſolvd into, or rather can be bronght to afford two or three differing Subſtances more then the Soot and Aſhes, whereinto the naked fire commonly divides them in our Chymnies, cry up their own Sect for the Invention of a New Philoſophy, ſome of them, as Helnom, &c. ſling themſelves Philoſophers by the Fire; and the moſt part not only aſcribing, but as far as in them lies, engroſſing to thoſe of their Sect the Title of PHILOSOPHERS. But alas, how narrow is this Philoſophy, that reaches but to ſome of thoſe ecompound Bodies, which we find but upon, or in the cruſt or outſide of our terreſtrial Globe, which is it ſelfbut a point in compariſon of the vaſt extended Univerſe, of whoſe other and greater parts the Doctrine of the Tria Prima does not give usan Account? For what does it teachus, either ofthe Nature of the Sun, which Aſtronomers affirme to be eightſcore and odd times bigger then the whole Earth? orol that of thoſe numerous fixt Starrs, which, for ought we know, would very ſfew, ifany of them, appear inferiour in bulke and brightneſs to the Sun, if they were as neer us as He? What does the knowing that Salt, ſulphur and Mercury, are the Principles oſ Mixt Bodies, informe us of the Nature of that vaſt, fluid, and ætherial Subſtance, that ſeemes to make up the interftellar, and conſequently much the greateſs part of the World? for as for the opinion commonly aſcribd to P4racelſus, as iſ he would have not only the four Peripatetick Elements, but even the Celcſtial parts of the Univerſe to eonſiſt of his three Principles, ſince the modern Chymiſts themſelves have not thought ſo groundleſs a conccit worth their owning, Iſhall not think it Worth my confuting. But I ſhould perchance forgive the Hypotheſis I have been all this while examining, if, though it reaches but to a vety little part oſ the World, it did at leaſt give us a ſatisfactory account of thoſe things to whichtis ſaid to reach. But I find not, that it gives us anv other then a very imperfect information even about mixt Bodies themſelves: For how will the knowledge of the Tria Prima diſcover to us the Reaſon, why the Loadſtone drawes a Needle and diſpoſcs it to reſpect the Poles, and yet ſeldom preciſely points at them? how will this Hypotheſis tcach Us how a Chick is formed in the Egęe, or how the Seminal Principles of Mint, Pompions, and other Vegitables, that Imentiond to You above, can faſhion Water into Various Plants, cach of them endowd with its peculia; and determinate ſhape, and with divers ſpeciſick and diſcriminating Qualities? How does this Hypotheſis ſiew us, how much Salt, how much Sulphur, and how much Mereury muſt be taken to make a Chick or a Pompion ? and if We know that, what Principle is it, that manages theſe Ingredients, and contrives (for inſtance) ſuch Liquors as the White and Yelk ofan Egge into ſuch a variety of Textures as is requiſite to faſhion the Bones, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, Tendons, Feathers, Blood, and other parts of a Chick; and not only to faſhion each Limbe, but to connect them altogether, after that manner that is moſt congruous to the perfection of the Animal which is to Conſiſt of Them? For to ſay, that ſome more fine and ſubtile part of either or all the Hypoſtatical Principles is the Director in all this buſineſs, and the Architect of all this Elaborate ſtructure, is to give one occaſion to demand again, what proportion and way of mixture of the Tria Prima afforded this Architectonick Spirit, and whar Agent made ſo skilful and happy a mixture 2 And the Anſwer to this Queſtion, iſ the Chymiſts will keep themſclies within their three Principles, ill be lyable to the ſame Inconvenience, that the Anſwer to the former was. And if it were not to intrench upon the Theame of a Friend of ours here preſent, I could caſily proſecute the Imperfections of the Vulgar Chymiſis Philoſophy, and ſhew you, that by going abour to explicate by their three Principles, Iſay nor, all the abſtruſe Properties of mixt Eodies, but even ſuch Obvious and more familiar Phænomena as Fluidity and Firmreſi, The Colours and Figures of Stones, Minerals, and other compound Bodies, The Nutrition of cither Plants or Animals, the Gravity of Gold or Quickſilver compard with Wine or Spirit of Wine; By attempting, Iſay, to render a reaſon of theſe Cto omit a thouſand others as difficult to account for) from any proportion of the three ſimple Ingrediènts, Chymiſts will be much more likely to diſcredit themſelves and their Hypciheſis, then ſatisfy an intelligent Inquirer aſter Truth. But C interpoſcs Eleatherus) This Objection ſeems no more rhen may be made againſt the ſour Peripatetick Elements. potheſis, that pretends by any Determinate Number of Material Ingredients to render a reaſon of the Phænomena of Nature. And as for the uſe of the Chymical Doctrine of the three Principles, I ſuppoſc you need not be told by me, that The great Champion of it, The Learncd Sennertus, aſſignes this noble uſe of the Tria Prima, That from Them, as the neereſt and moſt Proper Principles, may be Deducd and Demonſtrated the Properties which are in Mixt Bodies, and which cannot be Proximately (as They ſpeak) deducd from the Elements. And This, ſayes he, is chieſly Apparent, when we Inquire into the Properties and Faculties of Medecines. And Iknow ( continucs Eleutherius) That the Perſon You have aſſumd, of an Opponent of the Hermetick Doũtrine, will not ſo far prevaile againſt your Native and wonted Equity, as To keep You ſrom acknowle dging that Philoſophy is much beholden to the Notions and Diſcoveries of Chymiſts. If the Chymiſts You ſpeak of C RePlyes Carneades) had been ſo modeſt, pinion of the Tria Prima, but as a Notion uſeful among Others, to increaſe Humane knowledge, they had deſerv'd more of our thanks; and Icſs of our Oppoſition; but ſince the Thing that they pretend is not ſo much to contribute a Notion toward the Improvement of Philoſophy, as to make this Notion attended by a few leſſe conſiderable ones) paſs for a New Philoſophy it ſelf. Nay, ſince they boaſt ſo much of this phancie of theirs, that the famous Quercetanus ſcruples not to write, that if his moit certain Doctrine of the three Principles were ſufficiently Learned, Examind, and Cultivated, it would eaſily Diſpel all the Darkneſs that benights our minds, and bring in a Clear Light, that would remove all Difficulties. This School affording Theorems and Axiomes irreſragable, and to be admitted without Diſpute by impartial Judges ; and ſo uſeſul withal, as to exempt us ſrom the neceſſityof having recourſe, for want of the knowledg of cauſes, to that Sanctuary of the igorant, Occult Qualities; ſince, I ſay, this Domeſtick Notion of the Chymiſts is ſo much overvalued by them,I cannot think it unfit, theyſhould be made ſenſible of their miſtake; and be admoniſd 1 take in more fruitful and comprehenſive Principles, it they mean to give us an account of the Phæromena o Nature3 and not confine themſclves and  as far as they can) others to ſuch narrow Principles, as I fear will ſcarce inable them 10 give an account (I mean an intelligible one) of the tenth part (Iſaynot) of all the ?hæromena of Nature; but even of all ſuch as by the Leucippian or ſome of the other ſorts o Principles may be plauſibly enough explicatedl. And though Ibe not unvilling to grant, that the incompetency I impute to the Chymical Hypotheſis is but the ſame which may be Objecteò againſ that of the four Elements, and divers other Doctrines that have been maintaind by Learnedmen; yet ſincetis the Chymical Hyotheſis only which I am now examining, I ſee not why, if what I impure to it be a real inconvenience, either it ſnould ceaſe to be ſo, or I ſhould ſcruple to object it, becauſe other Theories are lyable thereunto, as well as the Hermetical. For I know not wh a Truth ſhould be thought leſſe a ; for the being ſit to overthrow variet; of I am oblig'd to You (continues Caræeades, a little ſmiling) for the favourable Opinion You are pleas'd to expreſs of my Equity, if there be no deſign in it. But I need not be tempted by anArtifice, or invited by a Complement, to acknowledge the great ſervice that the Labours oſ Chymiſts have done the Lovers of uſeful Learning; nor even on this occaſion ſhall their Arrogance hinder my Gratitude. But ſince we are as well examining to the truth of their Doctrine as the merit of their induſtry, I muſt in order to the inveſtigation of the firſt, continue a reply, to talk at the rate of the part I have aſſumd; And tell you, that when I acknowledg the uſefulneſs of the Labours of Spagyriſts to Nutural Philoſophy, I do it upon the ſcore of their experiments, not upon that of Their Speculations; for it ſcems to me, that their Writings, as their Furnaces, afford as well ſmoke as light 3 and do litile leſſe obſcure ſome ſubjects, then they illuſtrate others. And thoughIam unwilling to deny, thattis difficult ſor a man to be an Accompliſnt Naturaliſt, that is a ſtranger to Chymiſtry, yetI look upon of Chymiſts, almoſt as I do on the Letters of the Alphabet, without whoſe knowledge tis very hard for aman to become a Philoſopher; and yet that knowledge is very ſar ſrom being ſufficient to make him One. But  ſayes Carneades, reſuming a more ſerious Look) toconſider a litile more particularly what you alledg in ſavour of the Chymical Doctrine of the Tria Prima, though Iſhall readily acknowledge it not to be unuſeſul, and that the Diviſcrs and Embracers of it have done the Common- Wealth of Learning ſome ſervice, by helping to deſtroy that exceſſive eſteem, or rather veneration, wherewith the Doctrine of the four Elements was almoſt as generally as undeſervedly entertai'd 3 yet what has been alled9d concerning the uſefulneſs of the Tria Prima,ſcems to me liable to no contemptible Difficulties. And firſt, as for the very way of Probation, which the more Learned and more Sober Champions of the Chymical cauſe employ to evince the Chymical Principles in Mixt Bodies, it ſeems to me to be farr enough frombeing convincing. This grand and Ieading Argument, your Sennertus Himſelt, who layes Great weight upon it, and tells us, that the moſt Learned Phuoſophers employ this way of Reaſoning to prove the moſt important things, propoſes thus: æbicunque (ſayes h]e) plaribus eædem affectiones & qualita. es irſ unt, per commune quoddam Principium inſint veceſſe æſt, ſicut omnia ſunt Gravia propter terram, calida propter Iguem. At Colores, Odores, Scpores, eſſe nò, & ſimilia alia, mireralibus, Metallis, Gemmis, Lapidibus, Plantis, Animalitus inſunt. Ergo per comrune aliquod principium, & ſubiectum, inſunt. At tale principium non ſunt Elementa. Nullam onim hatent ad tales qualitates producendas potentiam. Ergo alia principia, unde fluant, inquirenda ſunt. In the Recital of this Argument, (ſayes Carneades) I therefore t ought fit to retain the Language wherein the Author ;ropoſes it, that I might alſo retain the propriety of ſome Latine Termes, to which Ido not readily remember any that fully anſwer in Englith. But as for the Argumentation it ſelf, tis built upon a precarious ſuppoſition, that ſcoms to me neither Demonſtrable nor true; for, how does it appear, that where the ſame Quality is to be met with in many Bodies, it muſt belong to them upon the Account of ſome one Body whereof they allpartake? (For that the Major oſ our Authors Argument is to bc Underſtood of the Material Ingredients of bodies, appears by the Inſtances of Earth and Fire he annexes to explain it. For to begin with that very Example which he is pleas'd to alledge for himſelf; how can he prove, that the Gravity of all Bodies procecds from what they participate of the Element of Earth ? Since we ſee, that not only common Water, but the more pure Diſtill'd Rain Water is heavy3 and Quickſilver is much heavier than Earth it ſelf; though none of my Adverſarics has yet prov'd, that it contains anyoſ that Element. AndI the Rather make uſe of this Example of Quickſilver, becauſe Iſee not how the Aſſertors of the Elements will give any better Account oſ it then the Chymiſts. Forif it be demanded how it comes to be Fluid, they will anſer, that it participates much of the Nature of Water. And indeed, according to them, Water may be the Predominant Element in it, ſince we ſce, that ſeveral Bodies which by Diſtillation afford Liquors that weigh more then their Caput Moytuum do not yet conſiſt of Liquor enough to be Fluid. Yet if it be demanded how Quickſilver comes to be ſo heavy, thentis reply'd, that tis by reaſon of the Earth that abounds in it3but ſince, according to them, it muſt conſiſt alſo of air, and partly of Fire, which they affirm to be light Elements, how comes it that it ſhould be ſo much heavier then Earih of the ſame bulk, though to fill up the poroſities and other Cavities it be made up into a maſs or paſte with Water, which it ſelf they allow to be a heavy Element. But to returne to our Spagyrists, we lee that Chymical Oyles and fixt Salts, though ncver ſo exquiſitely purifyd and freed from terreſtrial parts, do yet remain ponderous enough. And Experience has informd me, that a pound, for inſtance, of ſome of the heavieſt Woods, as Guajacum that will ſink in Water, being burnt to Aſhes will yield a much leſs weight of them  whereof I found but a ſmall part to be Alcalyzate) then much lighxX4 ter Vegetables: As alſo that the black Charcoal of it will not ſink as did the wood, but ſim;3 which argues that the Differing Gravity of Bodies proceeds chicſly from their particular Texture, as is manifeſt in Gold, the cloſeſt and Compacteſt of Bodies, which is many times heavier then we can poſſibly make any parcell of Earth of the ſame Bulk. I will not examine, what may be argu'd touching the Gravity or Quality Analagous thereunto, of cven Celeſtial bodies, from the motion of the ſpots about the Sun, d ſrom the appearing cquality of the ſuppos'd Seas in the Moon; nor conſider how little thoſc Phæmonea would agree with what Sennertus preſumes concerning Gravity. But further to invalidate his ſuppoſition, I ſhall demand, upon what Chymical Principle Fluidity depends? And yet Fluidity is, two or three perhaps excepted, the moſt diffuſed quality of the univerſe, and far more General then almoſt any other of thoſe that are to be met with i1any of the Chymicall Principles, cr Aristotelian Elements; ſince not only the Air, but that vaſt (xpanſion we call Heaven, in compariſon of which our Terreſtrial Globe ( ſuppoſing it were all Solid) is but a point; and perhaps to the Sun and the fixt Stars are fluid bodies. I demand alſo, from which of the Chymical Principles Motion flowes; which yet is an affection of matter much more General then any that can be deducd from any of the three Chymical Principles. I might ask the like Queſtion concerning Light, which is not only to be found in the Kind'd Sulptur of mixt Bodis, but (not to mention thoſe ſorts of rotten Woods, and rotten Fiſh that ſhine in the Dark) in the tails of living Glow-wormes, and in the Vaſt bodies of the Sun and Stars. I would gladly alſo know, in which of the three Principles the Quality, we call Sound, reſides as in its proper Subject; ſince either Oyl falling upon Oyle, or Spirit upon Spirit, or Salt upon Salt, in a great quantity, and ſrom a conſiderable height, will make a noiſe, or if you pleaſe, create a ſound, and (that the objection may reach the Ariſtotelians) ſo will alſo water upon water, and Earth upon Earth. And Icould name other qualities to be met within divers bodies, of which I ſuppoſe my Adverſaries will not in haſte aſſign any Subject, upon whoſe Account it muſt needs be, that the quality beJongs to all the other ſeveral bodies. And, before I proceed any further, I muſt here invite you to compare the ſuppoſition we are examining, with ſome other of the Chymical Tenents. For, firſt they do in effect teach that more then one quality may belong to, and be deducd ſrom, one Principle. For, they aſcribe to Salt Taſts, and the power of Coagulation; to ſulphur, as well Odours as inflamableneſs3 And ſome of them aſcribe to Mercury, Colours3 as all of them do efſumability, as they ſpeak. And on the other ſide, it is evident tnat Volatility belongs in common to all the three Principles, and to Water too. Fortis manifeſt, that Chymical Oyles are Volatile; That alſo divers Salts Emerging, upon the Analyſis of many Concretes, are very Volatile, is plain from the figitivencſs of Salt, of Harts- horne, fleſh, &c. aſcending in the Diſtillation of thoſe bodies. How eaſily water may be made to aſcend in Vapours, there is ſcarce any body that has not obſerv'd. And as for what they call the Mercuriall Principle of bodies, that is ſo apt to be raisd in the form of Steam, that Poracelſus and others define it by that aptneſs to fly up;3 ſo that (to draw that inference by the way) it ſcoms not that Chymiſts have been accurate in their Doctrine of qualities, and their reſpective Principles, ſince they both derive ſeveral qualities from the ſame Principle, and muſt aſcribe the ſame quality to almoſt all their Principles and other bodies beſides. And thus much for the firſt thing taken for granted, without ſuſficient proof, by your Sennertus: And to add that upon the Bye (continues Carneades) we may hence learn what to judge of the way of Argumentation, which that fierce Champion of the Ariſtotelians againſt the Chymiſts, Anthonius Guntheras Billichius employes, where he pretends to prove againſt Bequinus, that not only the four Elements do immediately concur to Conſtitute every mixt body, and are both preſent in it, and obtainable from it upon its Diſſolution but that in the Tria Prima themſelves, whereinto Chymiſts are wont to reſolve covers it ſelf to conſiſt of four Elements. The Ratiocination it ſelf (purſues Carneades) being ſomewhat unuſual, Idid the other Day Tranſcribe it, and (ſayes He, pulling a Paper out of his Pocket) it is this. Ordiamur, cum Beguino, a ligno viridi, quod ſi concremetur, videbis in ſudore Aquam, in fumo Aerem, in flamma & Prunis Ignem, Terram in cineribus: Quod ſi Beguino placuerit ex eo colligere bumidum aquoſum, cohibere humidum oleaginoſum, extrahere ex cineribus ſulem; Eg0 ipſi in unoquoque horũm ſeorſim quatuor Elementa ad oculum demonſtrabo, eodem artificio quo in ligno viridi ea demonſtravi. Humorem aquoſum admovebo Igni. Ipſe Aquam Etullire videbit, in Vapore Aerem cenſyiciet, Ignem ſentiet in ætu, plus minus Terræ in ſedimento apparebit. Humor porro Oleaginoſus aquam humiditate & fluiditate per ſe, accerſus vero Ignem ſiamma prodit, fumo Aerem, fuligine, nidore & amurea terram. Solem denique ipſe Beguinus ſiccum vocat & Terreſtrem, qui tamen nec fuſus Aquam, nec cauſtica vi ignem celare poteſt3 ignis vero Violertia in halitus verſus nec ab Aere ſe alienum ſſe demonſtrat; Idem de Latte, de Ouis, de ſemine Lini, de Garyphyllis, de Nitro, ile ſole Marino, denique de Antimonio, quod fait de Ligno viridi Judicium; eadem de illorum partibus, quas Beguinus adducit, ſententia, quæ de viridis ligni bumore aquoſo, quæ de liquore ejuſdem oleoſo, quæ de ſale fuit. This bold Diſcourſe ( reſumes Caineacles, putting up again his Paper,) I think it were not very difficult to conſute, if his Arguments were as conſiderable as our time will probably prove ſhort for the remaining and more neceſſary Part of my Diſcourſe3 wherefore referring You for an Anſwer to what was ſaid concerning the Diſſipated Parts of a burnt piece of green Wood, to whatI told Themiſtius on the like occaſion, I might eaſily ſnew You, how ſleightly and ſuperficially our Guntherus talks of the dividing the flame of Green Wood into his four Elements; #hen he makes that vapour to be air, which being caught in Glaſſes and condensd, preſently diſcovers it ſelfto have been but an Aggregate of innumerable very minute drops of Liquor and ”hen he would prove the Phlegmes being composd of Fire by that Hat whichis adventitious to the Liquor, and ceaſcs upon the abſence of what po ducd it  whether that be an Agitailon proceeding from the motion of the External Firè, or ihe preſence of a Multitude of igneous Atomes pervading the pores of the Veſel, and nimbly permeating the whole Body of the Water) I might, I ſay, urge theſe and divers other Weakneſſes of His Diſcourſe. But I will rather take Notice of what is more pertinent to the Occaſion of this Digreſſion, namely, that Taking it for Granted, that Fluidity (with which he unwarily ſeems to confound Humidity) muſt proceed from the Element of Water, he maXes a Chymical Oyle to Conſiſt of that Elementary Liquor; and yet inthe very next Words proves, that it conſils alſo oſ Fire,by its Iuflamability ; not remembring that exquiſitely pure Spirit o Wine is both more Fluid then Water it ſclf, and yet will Flame all away without leaving the Leat Aqucous Moiſture behind it3 and without ſuch an Anurca and Soot as he would Deduce the preſence of Earth from. So that the ſame Liquor may according to his Doctrine be concluded by ĩts great Fluidity to be almoſt all Water; and by its burning all aay to be all diſguiſed Fire. Andbythe like way of Probation our Author would ſhew that the fixt ſalt of Wood is compcunded of the ſoor Elements. For (ſayes he) being turn'd by the violence of the Fire into ſteames, it ſnews it ſelf to be of kin to Air; whereas I doubt whether he ever ſaw a true fixt Salt (which to become ſo, muſt have already endurd the vio]ence of an Incinerating Fire) brought by rhe Fire alone to aſcend in the Forme of Exhalations;3 but Ido not doubt that if he did, and had caught thoſc Exhalations in convenient Veſſcls, he would have found them as well as the Steames of common Salt, &c. ofa Saline and not an Acreal Nature. And whereas our Authour takes it alſo for Granted, that the Fuſibility of Salt muſt be Deduc’d from Woater, it is indeed ſo much the Efſect of heat variouſly agitating the Minute Parts of a Body, without regard to Water, that Gold(Which by its being the heavycſt and fixreſt of Bodies, ſhould be the moſt Earrhy) will be brought to Fuſion by a ſtrong Fire; which ſure is more likely to drive away then increaſe ĩts Aqueous Ingredient, if it have any; and on gitation of ĩts minute parts, Ice is not Fluid, but Solid; though he preſumes alſo that the Mordicant Quality of Bodies muſt proceed ſrom a fiery ingredient; whereas, not to urge that the Light and inflamable parts, which are the moſt likely to belong to the Element of Fire, muſt probably be driven away by that time the violence of the Fire has reducd the Body to aſhes; Not to urge this, I I ſay, nor that Oyle of Vitriol which uenches Fire, burnes the Tongue and eſh of thoſe that Unarily taſt or apply it, as a cauſtick doth, it is precarious to prove the Preſence of Fire in fixt ſalts from their Cauſtick power, unleſſe it were firſt ewn, that all the Qualities aſcribed to ſalts muſt be deducd from thoſe of the Elements; which, had I Time, I could eaſily manifeſt to be no eaſy talk. And not to mention that our Authour makes a Body as Homogeneous as any he can produce for Elementary, belong both to Water and Fire, Though it be neither Fluid nor Inſipid, like Water; nor light and Volatile, like Fire; he ſeems to omit in this Anatomy the Element of Earth, ſave That hè intimates, That the ſalt may paſs for that 3 But ſince a few lines before, he takes Aſhes ſor Earth, I ſee not how he will avoid an Inconſiſtency either betwixt the Parts of his Diſcourſe or betwixt ſome of them and his Doctrine. For ſince There is a maniſeſt Difference betwixt the Saline and the inſipid Parts of Aſhes, Iſee not how ſubſtances That Diſagree in ſuch Notable Qualities can be both ſaid to be Portions of an Element, whoſe Nature requires that it be Homogeneous, eſpecially in this caſe where an Analyſis by the Fire is ſuppos'd to have ſeparated it from the admixture of other Elements, which are confeſsd by moſt Ariſtotelians to be Generally found in common Earth, and to render it impure. And ſure if when we have conſiderd for how little a Diſparities ſake the Peripateticks make theſe Symbolizing Bodies Aire and Fire to be two Diſtinct Elements, we ſhall alſo conſider that the Saline part of Aſhes is very ftrongly Taſted, and eaſily ſoluble in Water;3 whereas the other part of the ſame Aſhes is inſipid and indiſſoluble in the ſame Liuor: Not to add, that the one ſubance is Opacous, and the other ſomeY what Diaphanous, nor that they difſer in Divers other Particulars 3 If we conſider thoſe things, Iſay, we ſhallhardly think that both theſe Subſtances are Elementary Earth; And as to what is ſometimes objected, that their Saline Taſt is only an Effect of Incineration and Aduſtion, it has been elſewhere fully replyd to, when propos'd by Themistius, and where it has been provd againſt him, that however inſipid Earth may perhaps by Additaments be turnd into Salt, vettis not like it ſould be ſo by the Fire alone:: For we ſee that when we reſine Gold and Silver, the violenteſt Fires We can Employ on them give them not the leaſt Relliſh of Saltneſs. And Ithink Philoponus has rightly obſerv'd, that the Aſhes of ſome Concretes contain very little ſalt if any atall; For Reſiners ſuppoſe that boneaſhes are ſfree from it, and therefore make uſe of them for Teſts and Cuppels, which ought to be Deſtitute of Salt, leſt the Violence of the Pire firould bring them to Vitrification; And having purpoſely and heedſully taſted a Cuppel made of only bone- aſhes and pos d to a Very Violent Fire, acuated y the Blaſt of a large pair of Double Bellows, Icould not perceive that the force of the Fire had imparted to it the leaſt Saltneſs, or ſo much as made it leſs Inſipid. But (ſayes Carneades) ſince neither You nor Ilove Repetitions, I ſhall not now make any ofwhat elfe was urg'd againſt Themiſtius but rather invite You to take notice with me that when cur Authour, though a Learned Man, and one that pretends sill enough in Chymiſtry to reforme the whole Art, comes to make good his confident Undertaking, to give us an occular Demonſtration oF the immediate Preſence of the four Elements in the reſolution of Green Wood, He is fain to ſay things that agree very litile with one another. For about the beginning of that paſſage of His lately recited to you, he makes the ſweat as he calls it of the green Wood to be Water, the ſmoke Aire, the ſhining Matter Fire, and the Aſes Earth; whereas a few lines aſter, he will in each of theſe, nay (as Ijuſt now noted)in one Diſtinct Part of the Aſhes, ſhew the four Elements. So that either the former AnæTr lyſis muſt be incompetent to prove that Number of Elements, ſince by it the burnt Concrete is not reduc'd into Elementary Bodies, but into luchas are yet each of them compounded of the four Elements; orelſe theſe Qualities from which he endeavours to deduce the preſence ofall the Elements, in the fixt ſalt, and each of the other ſeparated ſubſtances, willbe but a precarious way of probation: eſpecially if you conſider, that the extracted Aleali of Wood, being for ought appears at leaſt as ſimilar a Body as any that the Peripateticks can ſmew us, it its differing Qualities muſt e the preſence of Diſtinct Elements, it will ſcarce be poſſible for them by any way they know of employing the fire upon à Body, to ſhew that any Bodyis a Portion of a true Element: And hs recals to my mind, that I am now but in an occaſional excuſſion, which aimingonly to ſhew that the Peripateticks aswell as the Chymiſts take in our preſent Controverſic ſomething for granted which they ought to prove, Iſhall returne to my exceptions, where I ended the firft of them, and further tell you, that neither is that the only precarious thing that I take notice of in Sennertus his Argumentation; for when he inferrs, that becauſe the Qualities he Mentions as Colours, Smels, and the like, belong not to the Elements; they therefore muſt to the Chymical Principles, he takes that for granted, which will not in haſte be prov'd; as I might here manifeſt, but that Imay by ànd by have a fitter opportunity to take notice of it. And thus much at preſent may ſuffice to have Diſcour?d againſt the Suppoſition, that almoſt every Quali2l muſt have ſome som æẽ, as they ſpeak, ſome Native receptacle, wherein as in its proper Subject of inheſion it peculiarlyreſides, and on whoſe account that quality belongs to the other Bodies, Wherein it is to be met with. Now this Fundamental ſuppoſition being once Deſtroy'd, whatſoever is built upon it, muſt fall to ruine of it ſelf. But Iconſider further, that Chymiſts are (for ought Ihave found) far ſrom being able to explicate by any of the Tria Prima, thoſe qualities which they pretend to belong primarily unto it, and in mixt Bodies to Deduce from it. Tis true indeed, that ſuch quaY3 lities are not explicable by the four Eements; but it will not therefore follow, that they are ſo by the three hermetical Principles; and this is it that ſeems to have deceivd the Chymiſts, and is indeed a very common miſtake amongſt moſt Diſputants, who argue as it there could be but two Opinions concerning the Difficulty about which they contend ; and conſequently they interr, that if their Adverſaries Opinion be Erroneous, Theirs muſt needs be the Truth; whereas many queſtions, and eſpecially in matters Phyſiological, may admit of ſo many Differing H;pctheſes, that twill be very inconſiderate and fallacious to conclude (except where the Opinions are preciſely Contradictory) the Truth of one from the falſity of another. And in our particular caſe tis no way neceſſary, that the Properties of mixt Bodies muſt be explicable either by the Hermetical, or the Aristotelian Hypotheſis, there being divers other and more plauſible wayes of explaining them, and eſpecially that, which deduces qualities ſfrom the motion, figure, and contrivance of the ſmall parts of Bodies; as I think might be ſhewn, if the attempt were as ſeaſonable,as I fear it would be Tedious. I will allow then, that the Chymiſts do not cauſcleſsly accuſe the Doctrine of the four elements of incompetency to explain the Properties of Compound bodies. And for this Rejection of a Vulgar Error, they ought not to be denyd what praiſe men may deſerve for exploding a Doctrine whole Imperfections are ſo conſpicuous, that men necded but not to ſhut their Eyes, to diſcover them. But I am miſtaken, if our Hermetical Philoſophers Themſelves need not, as well as the Peripateticks, have Recourſe to more Fruitſull and Comprehenſive Principles then the tria Prima, tomake out the Properties of the Bodies they converſe with. Not to accumulate Examples to this purpoſe, ſ becauſe I hope for a fitter opportunity to proſecute this Subject) let us at preſent only point at Colour, that you may gueſs by what they ſay of ſo obvious and familiar a Quality, how little Inſtruction we are to expect ſrom the Tria Prima in thoſe more abſtruſe ones, which they with the riftotelians ſtile Occult. For about Colours, neiY4 ther do they at all agree among themſelves, nor have I met with anyone, o which of the three Perſwaſions ſoever, that does intelligibly explicate Them. The Vulgar Chymiſts are wont to aſcribe Colours to Mercury; Paracelſus in divers places attributes them to Salt3 and Sennertus, having recited their differing Opinions, Diſſents from both, and referrs Colours rather unto Sulphur. But how Colours do, nay, how they may, ariſe from eĩther of theſe Principles, Ithink you will ſcarce ſay that any has yet intelligibly explicated. And if Mr. Bojle will allow me to ſhew you the Experiments which he has collected about Colours, you will, I doubt not, confeſs that bodies exhibite colours, not upon the Account of the Predominancy of this or that Principle in them, but upon that of their Texture, and eſpecially the Diſpoſition of their ſuperſicial parts, whereby the Light rebounding thence to the Eye is ſo modiſid, as by differing Impreſſions variouſly to affect the Organs of Sight. Imight here take notice of the pleaſing variety of CoJours exhibited by the Triangular glaſs, (as tis wont to be call'd) and demand, what addition or decrement of either Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury, befalls the Body of the Glaſs by being Priſmatically figurd ; and yeitis known, that without that ſhape it would nor afford thoſe colours as it does. But becauſe it may be objected, that theſe are not real, but apparent Colours; that I may not loſe time in examing the Diſtinction, Iwill alledge againſt the Chyſts, a couple of examples of Real and Permanent Colours Drawn from Metalline Bodies, and repreſent, that without the addition of any extraneous body, Quickſilver may by the Fire alone, and that in glaſs Veſſels, be depriv-d of its ſilver- like Colour, and be turmd into a Red Body; and from this Red Body without Addition likewiſe may obtain'd a Mercury Bright and Specular as it was beforè; So that I have here a laſting Colour Generated and Deſtroyd (as Ihave ſeen) at pleaſure, without adding or taking away either Mercury, Salt, or Sulphur; and if you take a clean and ſlender piece of hardend ſteel, and apply to it the flame of a candſe at ſome litile diſtance ſhort of the point, You ſhall not have held the Steel long in the flame, but You ſhall perceive divers Colours, as Yellow, Red and Blew, to appear upon the Surface of the metal, and as it were run along in chaſe of one another towards the point; So that the ſame body, and that in one and the ſame part, may not only have a new colour producd in it, but exhibite ſucceſſively divers Colours within a minute of an hour, or thereabouts; and any of theſe Colours may by Removing the Steel ſrom the Fire, become Permanent, and laſt many years. And this Production and Variety of Colours cannot reaſonably be ſupposd to proceed from the Acceſſion of any of the three Principles, to which of them ſoever Chymiſts willbe pleas’d to aſcribe Colours; eſpecially conſidering, that if you but ſuddenly Reſrigerate that Iron, Firſt made Red hot, it will be hardend and Colourleſs again; and not only by the Flame of a Candle, but by any orher equivalent heat Conveniently appliid, the like Colours will again be made to appear and ſucceed one another, as at the Firſt. But Imuſt not any further proſecute an Occaſional Diſcourſe, thongh that were not ſo Difficult for me to do, as l fear it would be for the Chymiſts to give a better Account of the other Qualities, by their Principles, then they have done of Colours. And vour Sennertus Himſelf (though an Author I much value) would Ifear have been exceedingly puzſd to reſolve, by the T#ia Prima, halfe that Catalogue of Problems, which he challenges the Vulgar Peripateticks to explicate by their four Elements And ſuppoſing it were true, that Salt or Sulphur were the Princile to which this or that Quality may e peculiarly referrd, yet though he that teaches us this teaches us omething concerning That quality, yet he Teaches us but ſomething. For indeed he does not Teach us That which can in any Tollerable meaſure ſatisfie an inquiſitive Searcher after Truth. For what is it to me to know, that ſuch a quality.reſides in ſuch a Principle or Element, whilſt Iremain altogether ignorant of the Cauſe of that quality, and the manner of its production and Opcration ? Ho little do I know more then any Ordinary Man of Gravity, if I know but that the Heavineſs of mixe bodies proceeds from that of the Earth they are compos'd of, if I know not the reaſon why the Earth is Heavy? And how little does the Chymiſt teach the Philoſopher oſ the Nature of Purgatition, if he only tells him that the Purgative Vertue of Medicines reſides in their Salt ? For, beſides that this muſt not be conceded without Limitation, ſince the purging parts of many Vegetables Extracted by the Water wherein they are inſusd, are at moſt but ſuch compounded Salts, (I mean mingl'd with Oyle, and Spirit, and Earth, as Tartar and divers other Subjects of the Vegetable Kingdom afford;) And ſince too that Quickſilver precipitated either with Gold, or without Addition, into a powder, is wont to be ſtrongly enough Cathartical, though the Chymiſis have not yvet prov'd, that either Gold or MercuE have any Salt at all, much leſs any that is Purgative; Beſides this, I ſay, ho little is it to me, to know That tis the Salt of the Rhubarb for Inſtance) that purges, if Ifind That it does not purge as Salt; ſince ſcarce any Elementary Salt is in ſmall quantity cathartical. And if I know not how Purgation in general is effected in a Humane Body 7 Ina word, astis one thing to know a mans Lodging, and another, to be acquainted with him; ſo it may be one thing to know the ſubject wherein a Qualiry principally reſides, and another thing to have a right notion and knowledęg of the quality its ſel. Now that which I take to be the reaſon of this Chymical Deficiency, is the ſame upon whoſe account Ithink the Ariſtotelicn and divers other Theories incompetent to explicate the Origen of Qualities. For Iam apt to think, that men will never be able to explain the ?Phænomena of Nature, while they endeavour to deduce them only from the Preſence and Proportion of ſuch or ſuch material Ingredients, and con ſider ſuch ingredients or Elements as Bodies in a ſtate of reſt3 whereas indeed the greateſt part of the affections of matter, and conſequently of the Phænomena of nature, ſeems to depend upon the motion and the continuance of the ſmall parts of Bodies. For tis by motion that one part of matter acts upon another3 andtis, for the moſt part, the texture of the Body upon which the moving on or Impreſſion, and concurrs with ĩt to the production of thoſe Effects which mae up the chief part of the Naturaliſts Theme. But ( ſayes Eleutherius) me thinks for all this, you have leſt ſome part of what I alledœd in behalf of the three principles, unanſwerd. For all that you have ſaid will not keep this from being a uſeful Diſcovery, that ſince in the Salt of one Concrete, in the Sulphur of another and the Mercuryoſ a third, the Medicinal vertue of it reſides, that Principle ought to be ſeparated from the reſt, and there the deſired faculty muſt be ſought for. Tnever denyed ( Replyes Carneades) that the Notion of the Tria Prima may be of ſome uſe, but (continues he laughing) by what you now alledg for it, it will but appear That it is uſeſul to Apothecaries, rather than to Philoſophers, The being able to make things Operative being ſufficient to thoſe, whereas the Knowledge of Cauſes is the Thing ]ooked aſter by Theſe. And let me Tell You, Eleatherius, even this it ſelf vill need to be entertained with ſome caution. For firſt, it will not preſently follow, That if th ePurgative or other vertue of a ſimple may Be eaſily extracted by Water or Spinit of Winè, it Reſides in the Saltor Suiphur of the Concrete; Since unleſſe the Body have before been reſolved by the Fire; or ſome Other Powerſul Agent, it will, for the moſt part, afford in the Liquors I have named, rather the finer compounded parts of it ſelf, Than the Elementary ones. As I noted belore, That Water will diſſolve not only pure Salts, but Cryſtals of Tartar, Gumme Arabick, Myr?'h, and Other Compound Bodies. As alſo Spirit of Wine will Diſſolve not only the pure Sulphur of Concretes, but likewiſe the whole subſtance of divers Reſinous Bodies, as Benzoin, the Gummous parts of Jallap, Gumme Lacca, and Other bodies that are counted perfectly Mixt. And we ſeæ that the Extracts made either with Water or Spirit of ine are not of a ſimple and Elementary Nature, but Maſſes conſiſting of the looſer Corpuſcles, and finer parts of the Concretes whence they are Drawn; ſince by Diſtillation they may be Divided into more Elementary ſubſtances, Next, we may conſider That even when there intervenes a Chymical reſolution by he Fire, tis ſeldom in the Saline or Sulphureous principle, as ſuch, that the deſir'd Faculty of the Concrete Reſides; But, as that Titular Salt or Sulphur is yet a mixt body, though the Saline or Sulphureous Nature be predominant in it. For, if in Chymical Reſolutions the ſeparated Subſtances were pure and ſimple Bodies, and of a perſect Elementary Nature3 no one would be indued with more Specifick Vertues, than another; and their qualities would Diſfer as Little as do thoſe of Water. And let me add this upon the bye, That even Eminent Chymiſts have ſuffer'd themſelves to be reprehended by me for their over great Diligence in puriſying ſome of the things they obtain by Fire from mixt Bodies. For thongh ſuch compleatly purifyed Ingredients of Bodies might erhaps be more ſatisfactory to our Underſtanding; yet others are oſten more uſeful to our Lives, the eſficacy of ſuch Chymical Productions depending moſt upon what they retain of the Bodies whence they are ſeparated, or ſipated among themſelves3 whereas if they were meerly Elementary, their uſes would be comparatively very ſmall; and the vertues of Sulphurs, Salis, or Other ſuch Subſtances of one denomination, would be the very ſame. And by the Way (Eleutlerius) Iam inclind upon this ground to Think, That the artificial reſolution of compound bodies by Fire does nor ſo much enrich mankind, as it divides them into their ſuppoſed Principles; as upon the ſcore of its making new compounds by now combinations of the diſſipated parts of the reſolvd Body. For by this means the Number of mixt Bodies is conſiderably increaſedl. And many of thoſe new productions are indowd with uſeful qualities, divers of which they owe not to the body ſrom which they were obtein'd, but to Theit newly Acquired Texture. But thirdly, that which is principally to be Noted is this, that as there are divers Concretes whoſe Faculties reſide in ſome one or other of thoſe differing Subſtances that Chymiſis call their Sulphurs, Salts, and Mercuries, and conſequently may be beſt obtaind, by anaZ lyzing the Concrete whereby the deſired Principles may be had ſeverd or freed ſrom the reſt; So there ate other wherein the nobleſt properties lodge not in the Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, but depend immediately upon the form (orif you will) reſult from the determinate ſtructurc of the Whole Concrete; and conſequently they that go about to extract the Vertues of ſuch bodies, by expoling them to the Violence of the Fire, do exceedingly miſtake, and take the way to Deſtroy what they would obtain. I remmember that Helmont himſelf ſomewhere confeſſes, That as the Fire betters ſome things and improves their Vertues, ſo it ſpoyles others and makes them degenerate. And elſewhere he judiciouſly afſirmes, that there may be ſometimes greater vertue in a ſimple; ſuch as Naturẽ has made it, than in any thing that can by the fire be ſeparated from it. And leſt you ſhould doub whether he means by the vertues o things thoſe that are Medical 3 he has in one place this ingenuous confeſſion ; Credo ſayes he) ſimplicia in ſua ſimplicitate ſſe ſoficientia pro ſanatione omnium morborum. Nag. Barthias,even in a Comment upon Beguinus, ſcruples not to make this acknowledgment; Valde abſurdum eſt (ſayes he) ex omnibus rebus extracta facere, ſulia, quintas eſſentias 3 præſertim ex ſubſiantiis per ſe plane vel ſubtilibus vel homogeneis, quales ſunt uniones, Corallia, Moſcis, Ambra, &c. Conſonàntly whereunto he alſo tells Us (and Vouches the famou; Platerus, for having candidly given the ſame Advertiſement to his Auditors,) that ſome things have greater vertues, and better ſuited to our humane nature, when unprepar'd, than when they have pait the Chymiſts Fire3 as we ſee, ſayes my Author, in Pepper; of which ſome grains ſwallowed perform more tovards the relief of a Diſtempered ſtomack, than a Brca: quantity of the Oyle of the ſame ice. b It has been (purſues Carneades) by our Friend here preſent obſervd concerning Salt- petre, that none of the ſubſtances into which the Fire is wont to divide it, retaines either the Taſt, the cooling vertue, or ſome other of the properties of the Concrete; and that each of thoſe Subſtances acquires new qualities, not to be found in the Salt-Perre ĩt ſelf. The ſhining property of the tayls of gloworms does ſurvive but ſo ſhort a time the little animal made conſpicuous by it, that inquiſitive men have not ſcrupled publickly to deride Boptiſta Porta and others3 who deluded perhaps with ſome Chymical ſurmiſes have venturd to preſcribe the diſtillation of a Water from the tayles of Glowormes, as a ſure way to obtain a liquor ſhining in the Dark. To which I ſhall nowadd no other example than that afforded us by Amber3 which, whilſt it remains an intire body, is endowd with an Electrical faculty of drawing to it ſelf fethers, ſtrawes, and ſuch like Bodies3 which I never could obſerve cither in its Salt, ĩts Spirit, its Oyle, or in the Body I remember I once made by the reunion of its divided Elements; none of theſe having ſuch a Texture as the intire Goncrete. Andhowever Chymiſts boldly deduce ſuch and ſuch properties from this or that proportion of their component Principles; yet in Concretes that abound with this or that Ingredient, tis not alwayes ſo much by vertue of its preſence, nor its plenty, that the Concrete is qualify'd to perform ſuch and ſuch Effects; as upon the account of the particular texture of that and the other Ingredients, aſſociated aſter a determinate Manner into one Concrete (though poſſibly ſuch a proportion of that ingredient may be more convenient than an other for the conſtituting of ſuch a body.) Thus ina clock the hand is movd upon the dyal, the bell is ſtruck, and the other actions belonging to the engine are performd, not becauſe the Wheeles are of braſs or iron, or part of one metal and part of another, or becauſe the weights are of Lead, but by Vertue of the ſize, ſhape, bigneſs, and co- aptation of the ſeveral parts; which would performe the ſame things though the wheels were of Silver, or Lead, or Wood, and the Weights of Stone or Clay; provided the Fabrick or Contrivance of the engine were the ſame: though it be not to be denyd, that Braſſe and Steel are more convenient materials to make clock-wheels of than Lead, or Wood. Andto let you ſee, Eleatherius, that tis ſometimes at leaſt, upon the Fexture of the ſmall parts of a body, and not alwaies upon the preſence, or receſſe, or increaſe, or Decrement of any one of its Principle, that it may loſe ſome ſuch Qualities, and acquire ſome ſuch others as are thought very ſtrongly inherent to the bodies they Reſide in. I will add to what may from my paſt diſcourſe be referd to this purpoſe, this Notable Example, from my Own experience3 That Lead may without any additament, and only by various applications of the Fire, loſe its colour, and acquire ſometimes a gray, ſometimes a ye llowiſh, ſometimes a red, ſometimes aramethihtine colour;and after having paſt through theſe, and perhaps divers others, again recover its leaden colour, and made a bright body. That alſo this Lead, which is ſo flexible a metal, may be made as brittle as Glaſſe, and preſently be brought to be again flexible and Malleable as before. And beſides, that the ſame lead, which I find by Microſcopes to be one of the moſt opacous bodies in the World, may be reduced to a fine tranſparent glaſſe ; whence yet it may returne to an opacous Nature again; and all this, as I ſaid, without the addition of any extraneous body, and meerly bythe manner and Method of expoſing it to the ire. ready put you to ſo prolix a trouble, it is time for me to relieve you with a promiſe of putting ſpeedily a period to it; And to make good that promiſe, I ſhall from all that Ihave hitherto diſcourſed with you, deduce but this one propoſition by way of Corollary. ſThat it may as yet be doubted, hether or nothere be any determinate Number of Elements 3 Or, if you pleaſe, whether or no all compounãd bodies, elo conſit of the ſame number of Elementar⸗ ingredients or material Principles.] This being but an inference from the foregoing Diſcourſe, it will not be requiſite to infiſt at large on the proofs of it; But only to point at the chief of Them, and Referr You for Particulats to what has been already Delivered. In the Firſt place then, from what has been ſo largely diſcoursd, it may appear, that the Experiments wont to be brought, whether by the common Peripateticks, orby the vulgar Chymiſis, to demonſtratc that all mixt bodies are made up preciſely either of the four E]ements, or the three Hypoſtatical Principles, do not evince what they are alJedgd to prove. And as for the other common arguments, pretended to be drawn from Reaſon in favour of the 4ristotelian Hypotheſis (for the Chymiſts arc wont to rely almoſt altogether upon Experiments) they are Commonly grounded upon ſuch unrcaſonable or precarious Suppoſitions, thattis altogether as caſie and as juſt for any man to reject them, as for thoſe that take them ſor granted to aſſcrt them, being indeed all of them as indemonſtrable as the concluſion to be inferrd from them;and ſome of them ſo manifeſtly weak and prooſleſſe;that he muſt be a very courteous adverſary, that can be willing togrant them; and as unskilful a one, that can be compelled to do ſo. In the next place, it may be conſidered, it what thoſe Patriarchs Of the Spagyriſis, Paracelſus and Helmont, do on divers occaſions poſitively deliver, be true; namely that the Altalest does Reſolve all mixt Bodies into other Principles than the ſire, it muſt be decided which of the two reſolutions (that made by the Alkahest, or that made by the fire) ſhall determine the number of the Elements, before we can be certain how many there are. And in the mean time, we may take notice in the laſt place, that as the diſtinct ſubſtances whereinto the Altabeſt divides bodies, are aſfirmd to be differing in nature ſrom thoſe whereunto they ate wont to be reducd by fire, and 4 Voui Iam- e. ſapides to be obtaind from & æquiponderantem eduer ſome bodies more que omni prorſus ſulphurc aui in Number thanæfrom ſome others3 ſince he tells us, he could totally reduce all ſorts of Stones into Salt only, whereas of a coal he had two diſtinit Liquors. So, although we ſhould acquieſce in that reſolution whichis made by fire, we find not that all mixt bodies are thereby divided into the ſame number of Elements and Principles; ſome Concretes affordding more of them than others do 3Na and ſometimes this or that Body aſfording a greater number of Differing ſubſtances by one way of management, than the ſame yields by another. And they that out of Gold, or Mercury, or Muſco-. vyglaſſe, will draw me as many diſtinct ſubſtances as I can ſeparate ſrom Vitriol, or from the juice of Grapes variouſly orderd, may teach me that which Iſhall very Thankſully learn. Nor does it appear pear more congruous to that variety that ſo much conduceth to the perfection o the Univerſe, that all elemented bodies be compounded of the ſame numberof Elements, then it would be for a language, that all its words ſhould conſiſt of the ſame number ol Letters. a1233230333330908 THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST OR, A Paradoxical Appendix to the Foregoing Treatiſe. The Sixth Part. H Carneodes Having Diſpacht what he Thought Requiſite to oppoſe againſt what the Chymiſts are wont to alledge for Proof of their three Principles, Paus'd awhile, and lookd about him, to diſcover whether it were Time for him and his Friend to Rejoyne the Reſt of the Company. But Eleutherius perceiving nothing yet to torbid Them to Proſecute their Diſcourſe a little further, ſaid to his Friend, ( who had likewiſc taken Notice of the ſame thing) I halfe expected, Carneades, that after you had ſo freely declard Your doubting, whether there be any Determinate Number of Elements, Yoòu would have proceeded to queſtion whether there be any Elements at all. And I confeſs it will be a Trouble to me if You defeat me of my Expectation; eſpecially ſince you ſee the Ieaſure we have allowd us may probably ſuffice to examine that Paradox; becauſe you have ſo largly Deduc'd already many Things pertinent to it, that you need bur intimate how you would have them Applyd, and what you would inferr from them. Carneades having in Vain repreſented that their leaſure could be but very ſhort, that he had already prated very long, that he was unprepared to maintain ſo. great and ſo invidious a Paradox, was at length prevail'd with to tell his Friend; Since, Eleutheriis, you will have me Diſcourſe Ex Tempore of the Paradox you mention, Iam contenr, Obedience, then my Opinion) to tell you that (ſuppoſing the Truth of Helmonts and Paracelſu?s Alkaheſtical Experiments, if I may ſo call them) though it may ſeem extravagant, yet it is not abſurd to doubr, whether, for ought has been prov'd, there be a neceſſity to admit any Elements, or Hypoſtatical Principles, at all. And, as formerly, ſo now, to avoid the necdleſs trouble of Diſputing ſeverally with the Aristotelians and the Chymiſts, I will addreſs my ſelf to oppoſe them I have laſt namd, Becauſe their Doctrine about the Elements is more applauded by the Moderns, as pretending highly to be grounded upon Experience. And, to deal not only fairly but favourably with them, Iwill allow them to take in Earth and Water to their other Principles. Which I conſont to, the rather that my Diſcourſe may the better reach the Tenents of the Deripateticls 3 who cannot plead forany ſo probably as for thoſe two Elements3 that of fire above the Air being Generally by Judicious Men exploded as an Imaginary thing; And the Air not concurring to compoſe Mixt Bodies as one of their Elements, but only lodging in their pores, or Rather repleniſhing, by reaſon of its Weight and Fluidity, all thoſe Cavities of bodies here below, whe ther compounded or not, that are big enough to admit it, and are not filld up with any groſſer ſubſtance. And, to prevent miſtakes, Imuſt advertize You, thatI now mean by Elements, as thoſe Chymiſts that ſpeak plaineſt do by their Principles, certain Primitive and Simple, or perfectly unmingled bodies; which not being made of any other bodies, or of one another, are the Ingredients of which all thoſe calld perfectly mixt Bodies are immediately compounded, and into which they are ultimately reſolved: now whether there be any one ſuch body to be conſtantly met with in all, and each, of thoſe that are ſaid to be Elemented bodies, is the thing Inow queſtion. BY this State of the controverſie you will, Iſuppoſe, Gueſs, that I need not be ſo abſurd as to deny that there are ſuch bodies as Earth, and Water, and Quickſilver, and Sulphur: But Ilook upon Earthand Water, as component paits of the Univerſe, or rather oſ the Terreſtrial Globe, not of all mixt bodies. And though IWill not peremptorily deny that there may ſometimes either a running Mercury, or a Combuſtible Subſtance be obtaind ſrom a Mineral, or even a Metal; yet I need not Concede either of them to be an Element in the ſence above declard;as Iſhall have occaſion to ſhew you by and by. To give you then a brief account of the grounds I intend to proceed upon, I muſt tell you, that in matters of Philoſophy, this ſeems to me a ſuſfcient reaſon to doubt of a known and important propoſition, that the Truth of it is not yet by any competent proof made to appear. And congruouſly herunto, if Iſhew that the grounds upon which men are perſwaded that there are Elements are unable to ſatisſie a conſidering man, I ſuppoſc my doubts will appear rational. Now the Conſiderations that induce men to think that there are Elements, may be conveniently enongh referrd to two heads. Namely, the one, that it is neceſſary that Nature make uſe of Elements to conſtitute the bodies that are reputed Mixt. And the other, That the Reſolution of ſuch bodies maniſfeſts that nature had compounded them of Elementary ones. In reſerence to the former of theſe Conſiderations, there are two or three things that Ihave to Repreſent. And I will begin with reminding you of the Experiments I not long ſince related to you concerning the growth of pompions, mint, and other vegetables, out of fair water. For by thoſe experiments its ſeems evident, that Water may be Tranſmuted into all the other Elements; from whence it may be. inferrd, both, Thattis not every Thing Chymiſts ill call Salt, Sulphur, or Spirit, that needs alwayes be a Primordiate and Ingenerable body. And that Nature may contex a Plant ſ thoughthat be a perfectly mixt Concrete) without having all the Elements previouſly preſented to her to compound it of. And, if you will allow the relation I mention-d out of Mounſieur De Rochas to be True3 then may not only plants, but Animals and Minerals too, be produced out of Water, And however there is little doubt to be made, but that the plants my tryals aſforded me as they were like in ſo many other reſpects to the reſt of the plants of the ſame Denomination; ſo they would, in caſe I had reducd them to putrefaction, have likewiſe produc'd Wormes or other inſects, as well as the reſembling Vegetables are wonr todo; ſo that Water may, by Various Seminal Principles, be ſucceſſively Tranſmuted into both plants and Animals. Andif we conſider that not only Men, but even ſucking Children are, but too often, Tormented with Solid Stones, but that divers ſorts of Beaſts themſelves, (whatever Helmont againſt Experience think to the contrary) may be Troubled with great and Heavy ſtones in their Kidneys and Bladders, though they Feed but upon Graſs and other Vegetables, that are perhaps but Diſguiſed Watcer, it will not ſeem improbable that cven ſome Concretes of a mineral Nature, may Likewiſe be formd of Water. We may further Take notice, that as a Plant may be nouriſht, and conſequently may Conſiſt. of Common water3 ſo may both plants and Animals, (perhaps even from their Seminal Rudiments) conſiſt of compound Bodies, without having any thing meerly Elementary brought them by nature to be compounded by them: This is evident in divers men, who whilſt they were Infants were fed only with Milk, aſterwards Live altogether upon Fleſh, Fiſh, wine, and other perfectly mixt Bodies. It may be ſeen alſo in ſneep, who on ſome of our Englith Downs or Plains, grow very fat by feeding upon the graſle, without ſcarce drinking at all. And yet more maniſeſtly in the magots that breed and grow up to their full bigneſſe within the pulps of Apples, Pears, or the like Fruit. We ſce alſo, that Dungs that abound with a mixt Salt give a muc more ſpeedy increment to corn and other Vegetables than Water alone would do: And it hath been aſſurd me, by a man experiend in ſuch matters, that ſometimes when to bring up roots very early, the Mould they were planted in was made over-rich, the very ſubſtance of the Plant has taſted of the Dung. And let us alſo conſider a Graſt of one kind of Fruit upon the upper bough of a Tree of another kind. As for inſtance, the Ciens of a Pear upon a Wihite- thorne3 for there the aſcending Liquor is already alterd, either by the root, or in its aſcent by the bark, orboth wayes, and becomes a new mixt body : as may appear by the differing qualities to be met with in the ſaps of ſeveral trees; as particularly, the medicinal vertue of the Birch- Water ( whichI have ſometimes drunk upon Helmonts great and not undeſerved commendation) Now the graſt, being faſten'd to the ſtock muſt nece ſſarily nouriſh iĩts ſelf, and produce its Fruit, only out of this compound Juice prepared for it by the Stock, being unable to come at any other aliment. And if we conſider, how much of the Vegetable he feeds upon may  as we nored above) remain in anAnimal; we may eaſily ſuppoſe, That the blood of that Arnimal who Feeds upon this, though itbe a Well conſtituted Liquor, and have all the differing Corpuſcles that make it up kept in order by one præſiding form, may be a ſtrangely Decompounded Body, many of its parts being themſelves decOmpotnded. So little is it Neceſſary that even in the mixtures which nature her ſelf makes in Animal and Vegetable Bodies, ſhe ſmould have pure Elements at hand to make her compoſitions of. Having ſaid thus much touching the conſtitution of Plants and Animals, I might perhaps be able to ſay as much touching that of Minerals, and even Metalls, if it were as eaſy for us to make experiment in Order to the production of theſe, as of thoſe. But the growth or increment of Mincrals being uſually a work of exceſſively long time, and for the moſt part performd in the bowels of the Earth, where we cannot ſee it, I muſt inſtead of Experiments make uſe, on this occaſion, of Obſervations. That ſtones were not all made at once, but that are ſome ot them now adayes generated, may ( though it be denyd by ſome) be fully provd by ſeveral examples, of which I ſhall now ſcarce alledg any other, then that famous place in France known by the name of Les Cæves Gentieret, where the Water falling from the upper Parts of the cave to the ground does preſently there condenſe into little ſtones, of ſuch figures as the drops, falling cither ſeverally or upon one another, and coagulating preſently into ſtone, chance to exhibit. Of theſe ſtones ſome Ingenuous Friends of ours, that went a while ſince to viſit that place, did Ipe the favour to preſent me with ſome that they brought thence. And I remember that both that ſober Relator of his Voyages, Van Linſchoten, and another good Author, informus that in the Diamond Mines ( as they call them) in the East- Indies, when having digd the Earth, though to no great depth, they find Diamonds and take them quite away; Yet in a very few years they find in the ſame place new Diamonds producd there ſince. From oth which Relations, eſpecially the firſt, it ſcems probable that Nature does not alwayes ſtay for divers Elementary Bodies, when ſhe is to produce ſtones. And as for Metals themſclves, Authors of good note aſſure us, that even they were not in the beginning producd at once altogether, but have been obſervd to grow; ſo that what was not a Mineral or Metal before became one afterwards. Of this it were eaſie to alledg many teſtimonies of profeſſed Chymiſts. But that they may have the greater authority, Iſhall rather preſent you with a few borrowed from more unſuſpected writers. Sulpharis Mineram ( as the inquiſitive P. Fallopius notes) quæ nutrix eſt caloris ſubterranei fatri ſeu Archæi fontium & mineralium, Infra terran citiſſime renoſci tes antur Historia Motallicæa. Sunt enim loca e quibus ſi hoc anno ſulphur effoſſum fuerit; intermiſſa foſone per quadriennium redeunt folores & omnia ſulphure, ut autea, rurſus invenunt plena. PlinyRelates,. ſu Italiæ Inſula Ilua, gigni ferri metallum. Sturabo multo expreſius 3 effoſſum ibi metallum ſemper regenerari. Nam ſi effoſio ſpatio centum annorum intermittebatur, & iterum illuc revertebantur, ſeſſores reperiſſe maximam copiam ferri regeneratam. VWhich hiſtory not only is countenanced by Fallopims, from the Incom which the Iron of that Iſland yiclded the Duke of Florence in his time; but is mentiod more expreſſely to our purpoſe, by the Learned Ceſalpinus. Vena (ſayes he) ferri copioſiſima eſt in Italia ;3 ob eam nobilitata Ilua Tirrheni maris Irſula incredibili copia, etiam noſtris temporibus eam gignens : Nam terra quæ eruitur dum vena effoditur tota, procedente tempore in venam convertitur. Wnhich laſt clauſe is therefore very notable, becauſe from thence we may deduce, that earth,by a Metalline plaſtick principle latent init, maybe in proceſte oftime changd into a metal. And even Aęricola himſelf, though the Chymiſts complain of him as their adverſary, acknowledges thus much and more; by telling us that at a Toom, . n Lygiis, ad Sagam t called Saga In Ger-pratis cruitur ferrum, ſ. many, they dig up I- titudinem bitedaneam all . . cenrio reratum denuo fo ron in the Ficlds, by aliter ac Ilvæ ferrum. ſinking ditches two foot deep; And adding, that within the ſpace of ten years the Ditches are digęced again for Iron ſince produced, As the ſame Metal is wont to be obtaind in Elva. Alſo concerning Lead, not to mention what even Galen notes, that it will increaſe both in bulk and Weight if it be long kept in Vaults or Sellars, where the Air is groſs and thick, as he collects from the ſmelling of thoſe picces of Lead that were imployd to faſten together the parts of old Statues. Not to mention this, Iſay, Toccacius Certaldus, as  find him Quoted by a Diligent VVriter, has this Paſſage touching the Growth of Lead.

I might Add to theſe, continues Carneades, many things that Ihave met with concerning the Generation of Gold and Silver. Bur, for ſear of vanting time, Iſhall mention but two or three Narratives. The Firſt you may find Recorded by Gerlhardus the Phyſick Profeſſor, in theſe Words. In valle (ſayes he) Joachimaca argentum gramini modo & more e Lavidibus mineræ velut e radice excreviſſe digiti Lmgitudine, teſtis eſt Dr. Schreterus, qui ejuſmodi venas aſpeſtu jucundas & admirabiles Domi ſua aliis ſæpe monſtravit & Donavit. Item Aqua crules Inventa eft Annebergæ, ubi argentum erat adhuc in primo ente, quæ coagulata redata est in calcem fixi & boni argenti. The other two Relations I have not met within Latine Authours, and Jel they are both very memorable in themſclves, and as pertinent to our preſent purpoſe. The firſt I meet with in the Commentary of Johannes Valehius upon the Xleine Baur, In which that Induſtrious Chymiſt Relates, with many circumſtances, that at a Mine-Town (If I may ſo Engliſh the German Bergſtat) eight miles or Leagues diſtant from Stræſcurg callld Mariakirch, a Workman came to the Overſcer, and deſired employment; but he telling him that there was not any of the beſt ſort at preſent for him, added that till he could be preferrd to ſome ſuch, he might in the mean time, to avoid idleneſs, work in a Grove or Mine-pit thereabouts, which at that time was little eſteemd. This Workman after ſome weeks Labour, had by a Crack appearing in the Stone upon a Stroak given near the wall, an Invitation Given him to Work his Way through, which as ſoon as he had done, his Eyes were ſaluted by a mighty ſtone or Lump which ſtood in the middle of the Cleſt ſ that had a hollow place behind it) upright, and in ſhew like an armed-man; but conſiſted of pure fine Silver having no Vein or Ore by it, or any other Additament, but ſtood there free, having only underfoot ſomething like a burnt matter3 and yet this one Lump held in Weight above a 1000 marks, which, according to the Duch, Account makes 500 pound weight of fine ſilver. From which and other Circumſtances my Author gathers 3 That by the warmth of the place, the Noble Metalline spirits, ( Sulphureous and Mercurial) were carri'd from the neighbouring Galleries or Vaults, through other ſmaller Cracks and Clefts, into that Cavity, and there collected as in a cloſe Chamber or Cellar3 whereinto when they were gotten, they did in proceſs of time ſettle into the forementioned precious maſs of Metal. The other Germane Relation is of That great Traveller and Laborious Chymiſt Tohannes (not Georgu:) Agricola 3 who in his notes upon what Poppius has written of Antimony, Relates, that when he was among the Hungarian Mines in the deep Groves, he obſerv'd that there would often ariſe in them a warm Steam (not of that malignant ſort which the Germains call Shvadt, which (ſayes he) is a meer poyſon, and often ſuffocates the Diggers, wlich faſtemd it ſelf to the Walls; and that coming again to review it after a couple of dayes, he diſcern'd that it was all very faſt, and gliſtering; Whercupon having collected it and Diſtill]d it per æetortam, he obtaind from it a fine Spirit, adding, that the Mine-Men inform'd him, that this Steam or Damp of the Engliſh Mine (retaining the dutch Term) would at laſt have become a Metal, as Gold or Silver. I referr  ſayes Carneades) to another Occaſion, the Uſe that may be made of theſe Narratives towards the explicating the Nature of Metalls; and that of Fixtneſs, Malleableneſs, and ſome other Qualities conſpicuous in them. And in the mean time, this I may at preſent deduce from theſe Obſervations, That tis not very probable, that, whenſoever a Mineral, or even a Metall, is to be Generated in the Bowels of the Earth, Nature needs to have at hand both Salt, and Sulphur, and Mercury to Compound it of; for, not to urge that the two laſt Relations ſeem leſs to favorr the Chymiſts than Aristitle, . would have Metals Generated of certain Halitus or ſteams, the ſorementiond Obſervations together, make it ſeem more Likely that the mineral Earths or thoſe Metalline ſteams(wherewith probably ſuch Earths are plentiſully imbud) do contain in them ſome ſeminal Rudiment, or ſome thing Equivalent thereunto;3 by whoſe plaſtick power the reſt of the matter, though perhaps Terreſtrial and heavy, is in Tract of time faſhiond into this or That metalline Ore; almoſt as Iformerly noted, that fair water was by the ſeminal Principle of Mint, Pompions, and other Vegetables, contriv'd into Bodies anſwerable to ſuch Seeds. And that ſuch Alterations of Terreſtrial matter are not impoſſible, ſeems evident ſrom that notable Practice of the Boylers of SaltPetre, ho unanimouſly obſerve, as well here in England as in other Counrries; That iſ an Earth pregnant with Nitre be depriv'd, by the affuſion of water, of all ĩts true and diſſoluble Salt, yet the Earth vill aſter ſome years yield them Salt- Petre again; For which reaſon ſome of the eminent and skillfulleſt of them keep it in heaps as a perpeal Mine of Salt Petre3 whence it may appear, that the Scminal Principle of Ntre latent in the Earth does by degrees Transforme the neighbouring matter into a Nitrous Body; for though I deny that ſome Volatile Nitre may by ſuch Earths be attracted (as they ſpeak) out of the Air, yet that the innermoſt parts of ſuch great heaps that lye ſo remote from the Air ſhould borrow from it all the Nitre they abound with, is not probable, ſor other reaſons beſides the remoteneſs of the Air, though I have not the Leaſure to mention them. And I remember, that a perſonof Great Credit, and well acquainted with the wayes of making Vitriol, affirmd to me, that he had obſervd, that a kind of mineral which abounds in that Salt, being kept within Doors and not exposd (as is uſual) to the free Air and Rains, did of it ſelf in no very long time turn into Vitriol, not only in the outward or ſuperficial, but even in the internal and moſt Central parts. And I alſo remember, that I met with a certain kind of Merkaſite that lay together in great Quantities under round, which did, even in my chamter, in ſo ſew hours begin of it ſelf to turne in1o Vitriol, that we need not diſtruſt the newly recited narrative. But to return to what Iwas ſaying of Nitre ; as Nature made this Salt-Petre out of the once almoſt and inodorous Earth it was bred in, and did not find a very ſtinking and corroſive Acid Liquor, and a ſharp Alcalyzate Salt to ecompound it of, though theſe be the Bodies into which the Fire diſſolves it3 ſo it were not neceſſary that Nature ſhould make up all Metals and other Minerals of Pre- exiſtent Salt, and Sulphur, and Mercury, though ſuch Bodies might by Fire be obtained from it. Which one conſideration duly weigh'd is very conſiderable in the preſent controverſy : And to this agree well the Relations of our two German Chymiſis; for beſides that it cannot be convincingly provd, it is not ſo much as likely that ſo languid and moderate a heat as that within the Mines, ſhould carry up to ſo reat a heat, though in the forme of umes, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury;ſince we find in our Diſtillations, that it requires a conſiderable Degree of Fire to raiſe ſo much as to the height of one foot not only Salt, but even: Mercury ĩt ſelf, in cloſe Veſſels. Andif it be objected, that it ſeems by the ſtink that is ſometimes obſerv'd when Lightening falls down bere below, that ſulphureous ſteams may aſcend very high without any extraordinary Degree of heat; It maãy be anſwerd, among other things, that the Sulphur of Silver is by Chymiſts ſaid to be a fixt Sulphur, though not altogether ſo well Digeſted as that of Gold. But, proceeds Carneades, If it had not been to aſſord You ſome hints concerning the Origine of Metals, I need not have deducd any thing from theie Obſervations 3 It not being neceſſary to the Validity of my Argument that my Deductions ſrom them ſhould be irrefragable, becauſe my Adverſaries the Ariſtotelians and Vulgar Chymiiis do not, I preſume, know any better then I, ⸗ priori, of what ingredients Nature compounds Metals and Minerals. For their Argument to prove that thoſe Bodies are made up of ſuch Principles, is drawn a pesteriori I mean from this, that upon the Analyſis of Mineral bodies they are reſolv'd into thoſe differing ſubitange That we may therefore examine this Argument, Let us proceed to conſider what can be alledg]d in behalf of the Elements ſrom the Reſolutions of Bodies by the fire; which you remember was the ſecond Tophick whence I told you the Arguments of my Adverſaries were deſumd. And that I may firſt diſpatch what I have to ſay concerning Minerals, I will begin the remaining part of my diſcourſe with conſidering how the fire divides them. And ſirt, Ihave partly noted above, that though Chymiſts pretend from ſome to draw ſalt, from others running Mercury, and from others a Sulphur3 Yer they have not hitherto taught us by any way in us among them to ſeparate any one principle, whether Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury, from all ſorts of Minerals without exception. And thence I may be al]owd to conclude that there is not any of the Elements that is an Ingredient of all Bodies, ſince there are ſome of which it is not ſo. In the next place, ſuppoſing that either Sulphur or Mercury were obtainable from all ſorts of Minerals. Yet ſtill shis Sulphur or Mercury would be but a compounded, nor an Elementary body, as Itold you alieady on another occaſion: And certainly he that takes notice of the wonderful Operations of Quickſilver, whether it be common, or drawn ſrom Mincral Bodies, can ſcarce be ſo inconſiderate as to think it of the very ſame nature with that immature and fugitive ſubſtance which in Vegetables and Animals Chymiſts have been pleas'd tocall their Mercury. So that when Mercury is got by the help of the fire out of a metal or other Mineral Body, if we will not ſuppoſe that it was not pre- exiſtent in it, but produc'd by the action of the fire upon the Concrete, we may at leaſt ſuppoſe this Quickſilver to have been a perfect Body of its own kind ( though perhaps leſſe heterogeneous then more ſecundary mixts) which happen'd to be mingl'd per minima, and coagulated with the other ſubſtances, whereof the Metal or Mineral conſiſted. As may be exemPlyied partly by Native Vermillion wherein the Quickſilver and Sulphur being exquiſitely blended both with one ænother, and that other courſe Mineral ſtuff C what ever it that harbours them, make up a red body differing enough from both; and yet from which part of the Quickſilver, and of the Sulphur, may be eaſily enough obtaind; Partly by thoſe Mines wherein nature has ſo curiouſly incorporated Silver with Lead, thattis extreamly difficult, and yet poſſible, to ſeparate the former out of the Latter. And partly too by native Vitriol, herein the Metalline Corpuſcles are by skill and induſtry ſeparable from the ſaline ones, though they be ſo con-coagulated with them, that the whole Concrete is reckod among Salts. And here I further obſerve, that I never could ſee any Earth or Water, properly ſo call'd, ſeparated from either Gold or Silver (to name now no orher Metalline Bodies) and therefore to retort the argument upon my Adverſaries, I may conclude, that ſince there are ſome bodies in which, for ought appears, there is neither Earth nor Water. may be allowd to conclude that neither of thoſe two is an Univerſal Ingredient of all thole Bodics that are counted perfectly mixt, which Ideſire you oud remember againſt Anon. It may indeed be objected, that the reaſon why from Gold or Silver we cannot ſeparatę any moiſture, is,becauſe that when it is melted out of the Oure; the vehement Fire requiſite to its Fuſion ford away all the aqueous and fugitive moiſture; and the like fire may do from the matcrials of Glaſs. To which I ſhall Anſwer, that I Remember I rcad not long ſincc in the Learned Toſephus Acoſta, ho relates it upon his own obſervation; that in America, (where he long lived) there is a kind of Silver which the Iudians call Papas, and ſometimes (ſayes he) they find pieces very fine and pure like to ſmall round roots, the which is rare in that metal, but uſuall in Gold; Concerning which metal he tells us, that beſides this they find ſome which they call Gold in grains, which he tells us are ſmall morſcls of Gold that they find whole without mixture of any other metal, which hath no need of melting or Refining in the re. Iremember that a very skilful and credible perſon affirmed to me, that being in the Hungarion mines he had the good fortune to ſce a mineral that was there digęd up, wherein pſeces of Gold of the length, and alſo almoſt of the bigneſs of a humane Finger, grew in the Oufr, as if they had been parts and Branches of Trees. And Ihave my ſelf ſeen a Lump of whitiſh Mineral, that. was brought as a Rarity to a Great and knowing Prince, wherein there grew here and there in the Stone, which looked like a kind of ſparr, divers little Lumps of fine Gold, (tor ſuch Iwas aſſured that Tryal had maniſeſted it to be ſome of them Sceming to be about the Bigneſs of peaſe. Bur that is nothing to what onr 4coſta ſubjoynes, which is indeed very memorable, namely, that of the morſels of Native and pure Gold, which we Iately heard him mentioning he had now and then ſeen ſome that weighed many pounds; to whichI ſhall add, gceAcoſta that I my ſelf have ſeen a Lump of the orecited Place, and the paſſge of Pliny noted: y him. Oar not long ſince digged up, in whoſe ſtony part there grew, almoſt like Trees, divers parcœls though not of Gold, yet of (what perhaps Mineraliſts will more wonder at) another Metal mixt with any Heterogencous Subſtances, and were ſome of them as big as my Finger, if not bigger. But upon Obſcrvations of this kind, though perhaps I could, yet Imuſt not at preſent dwell any longer. To proceed Therefore now (ſayes Carneades) to the Conſideration of the Analyſis of Vegetables, although my Tryals give me no cauſe to doubt bur that out of moſt of them five differing Subſtances may be obtaid by the fire, yet I think it will not be ſo caſily Demonſtrated that theſe deſerve to be calld Elements in the Notion above explaind. And before Ideſcend to particulars, I ſhall repeat and premiſe this General Conſideration, that theſe differing ſubſtances that are calld Elements or Primciples, differ not ſfrom each other as Metals, Plants and Animals, or as ſuch Creatures as are immediately producd cach by its peculiar Seed, and Conſtitutes a diſtinct propagable ſort of Creatures in the Univerſe 3 but theſe are only Various Schemes of matter or Subances that differ from each other, but in conſitence (as Running Mercury and the ſame Metal congeald by the Vapor of Lead) and ſome very fow other accidents, as Taſt, or Smel, or Inflamability, or the want of them. So that by a change of Texture not impoſſible to be wrought by the Fire and other Agents that have the Faculty not only to diſſociate the ſmal parts of Bodies, but afterwards to connect them after a new manner, the ſame parcell of matter may acquire or loſe ſuch accidents as may ſuffice to Denominate it salt, or Sulphur, or Earth. If I were fully to clear to you my apprchenſions concorning this matter, I ſhould perhaps be obliged to acquaint you with divers of the Conjectures (for I muſt yet call them no more) Ihave had Concerning the Principles of things purely Corporeal: For though becauſe I ſeem not ſatisf'd with the Vulgar Doctrines, either of the Peripatetick or Paracelſian Schools, many of thoſe that know me, (and perhaps, among Them, Eleutherius himſelf) have thought me wedded to the Epicurean Hypotheſes, (as others have miſtaken me for an Helmontian 3) yet if you knew how little Converſant I have been with Epicurea himſelf Inever yet had the Curioſity to read, you would perchance be of another mind; eſpecially iſf Iwere to entertain you at large, Iſay not, of my preſent Notions;3 but of my former thoughts concerning the Principles of things. But, as I ſ2id above, ully to clear my Apprehenſions would require a Longer Diſcourſe than we can now have. For, I ſhould tell you that I have ſometimes thought it not unfit, that to the Principles which may be aſign'd to things, as the World is now Conſtituted, we ſnhould, if we conſider the Great Maſs of matter as it was hilſt the Univerſec was in making, add another, which may Conveniently enough be calld an Architectonick Principle or power; by which I mean thoſe Various Determinations, and that Skilſull Guidance of the motions of the ſmall parts of the Univerſal matter by the moſt wiſe Author of things, which were neceſſary at the beginning to turn that conſus'd Chaos into this Orderly and heautifull World; and Eſpecially, to contrive the Bodies oſ ABb4 nimals and Plams, and the Seeds ol thoſe things whoſe kinds were to be propagated. For I confeſs Icannot well Conceive, how ſrom matter, Barely put into Motion, and then leſt to it ſelf, there could Emerge ſuch Curious Fabricks as the Bodies of men and perſect Animals, and ſuch yet more admirably Contrivd parcels of matter, as the ſeeds of living Creatures. I ſhould likewiſe tell you upon what grounds, and in what ſence, Iſuſpected the Principles of the World, as it now is, to be Three, Matter, 2otion and Rest. I ſay, as ibe world now is, becauſe the preſent Fabrick of the Univerſe, and eſpecially the ſeeds of things, together with the eſtabliſhit Courſc of Nature, is a Requiſite or Condition, upon whoſe account divers things may be made out by our three Principles, which otherwiſe would be very hard, iſ poſſible, to explicate. I ſhiould morcover declare in general (forI pretend not to be able to do it otherwiſe) not only why I Conceive that Colours, Odors, Taſts, Fluidneſs and Solidity, and thoſe other qualities that Diverſifie and Denominate Bodies may Intelligibly be Deduced from theſc three ; but how two of the Threæ Epicurean Principles (which, I need not tell, you are Magnitude, Figure and Weight) arc Themſelves Deducible from Matter and Motion; ſince the Latter of theſe Variouſly Agitating, and, as it were, Diſtracting the Former, muſt needs disjoyne its parts; which being Actually ſeparated muſt Each of them neceſſarily both be of ſome Size, and obtain ſome ſhape or other. Nor did I add to our Principles the Ariſtotelean Privation, panily for other Reaſons, which Imuſt not now ſtay to inſiſt on; and partly becauſe it ſedms to be rather an Antecedent, ora Terminus a quo, then a True Principle, as the ſtartingPoſt is none of the Horſes Legs or Limbs. I ſhould alſo explain why and how I made reſ to be, though not ſo conſiderable a Principle of things, as Motion, vet a Principle of them; partly becauſe it is (for ought we know as Ancient at leaſt as it, and depends not upon Motion, nor any other quality of matter; and partly, becauſeit may enable the Body in which it happens to bo both to contime in a State of Reſt till ſome external force put it out of that ſtate, and to concur to the production of divers Changes in the bodies that hit againſt it, by either quite ſtopping or leſsning their Motion ( whilſt the body formerly at Reſt Receives all or part oſ it into iĩt ſelf) or elſe by givinga new Byaſs, or ſome other Modification, to Motion, that is, To the Grand and Primary inſtrument whereby Nature produces all the Changes and other Qualities that are to be met with in the World. I ſhould likewiſe, after all this, cxplain to you how, although Matter, Motion and Reſt, ſeemd to me to be t Catholick Principles of the Univerſe, I thought the Principles of Particular bodies might be Commodiouſly enough reducd to two, namely Matter,and (What Comprehends the two other, and their eſfets) the reſult or Aggregate of thoſe Accidents, which are the Motion or Reſt, (for in ſome Bodies both arc not to be found) the Bigneſs, Figure, Texture) and the thence reſulting Qualities of the ſmall parts) which are neceſſory to intitle the Body whereto ihe; belong to this or that Peculiar Denomination; and diſcriminating it fromo. thers to appropriate it to à Determinate Kind of Things, as Yellowneſs, Fixtneſs, ſuch a Degree of Weight, and of Ductility, do make the Portion of matter wherein they Concur, to be reckond among perfect metals, and obtain the name of Gold.)) Which Aggregate or reſult of Accidents you] may, it You pleaſe, call either Struſture or Texiure. Thongh indecd, that do not ſo properly Compræhend the motion of the conſtituent parts eſpecially in caſe ſome of them be Fluid, or what other appellation ſhall appear moſt Expreſſive. Or if, retaining the Vulgar Terme, You vill call it the Forme of the thing it denominates, I ſhall not much oppoſe it; Provided the word be interpreted to mean but what I have expreſsd, and not a Scholaſtick Subſtantial Forme, which ſo many intelligent men proſeſs to be to them altogether Un- intelligible. But, ſayes Carneades, if you remember thattis a Sceptick ſpeaks to you, and that tis not ſo much my preſent Talk to make aſſertions as to ſuggeſt doubts, I hope you will look upon what I have proposd, rather as a Narrative of my former conjectures touching the principles of things, then as a Reſolute Declaration of my preſent opinions of them; eſpecially ſince although they cannot but appcar Very much totheir Diſadvantage, If you Conſider Them as they are propod without thoſe Reaſons and Explanations by which l could perhaps make them appear much Jeſſe extravagant; yet Iwant time to offer youwhat may be alledg'd to clear and countenance theſe notions 3 my deſign in mentioning them unto you at preſent being, pa tly, to bring ſome Light and Conſirmãtion to divers paſſages of my diſcourſe to you; partly to ſnew you, that I do not  as you ſeem to have ſuſpected) embrace all Epicurus his principles; but Diſſent from him in ſome main things, as well as from Ariſtotle and the Chymiſis, in others; & partly alſo, or rather chiefly, to intimate to you the grounds upon which Ilikewiſe differ from Helmont in this, that whereas he aſcribes almoſt all things, and even diſeaſes themſelves, to their ꝶ terminate Seeds3 I am of opinion, thar beſides the peculiar Fabricks of the Bo. dies of Plants and Animals  and perhaps alſo of ſome etals and inerals ) whichI take to be the Effccts of ſeminal principles, there are many other bodies in nature which have and deſerve diſtinẽt and Proper names, but yet do but reſult from ſuch contextures oſthe matter they are made of, as may without determinate ſeeds be effected by heat, cold, artificial mixtures and compoſitions, and divers other cauſes which ſometimẽs nature imployes of her own accord; andoſtentimes man by his power and skill makes uſe of to faſhion the matter according to his Intentions. This may be exempliũied both in the productions of Nature, and in thoſe of Art3 ofthe firſt ſort I might name multitudes;3 but to ſhew how eight a variation of Textures without addition of new ingredients may procure a parcel of marter divers names, and make it be Lookt upon as Different ngs; I oal invite you to obſerve with me, That Clouds, Hain, Hail, Snow, Froth, and Ice, may be but water, having ĩs parts varyed as to their ſize and diſfance in reſpect of cach other, and as to motion and reſt. And among Artificial Productions we may take notice (to skip the Cryſtals of Tartar) of Glaſs, Regulus, Martis- Stellatus, and particularly of the Sugar of Lead, which though made of that inſipid Metal and ſour ſalt of Vinager, has in it a ſweetneſſe ſurpaſſing that of common Sugar, and divers other qualities, which being not to be found in either of its two ingredients, muſt be confeſd to belong to the Concrete it ſelf, upon the account of its Texture. This Conſideration premisd, it will be, I hope, the more eaſie to perſwade you that the Fire may as well produce ſome new textures in a parcl of matter, as deſtroy the old. Werefore hoping that you have not forgot the Arguments formerly imployd againſt the Doctrine of the Tria prima; namely that the Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, into which the Fire ſeems to reſolve Vegetable and Animal Bodies, are yet compounded, not ſimple and Elementary Subſtances3 And that (asappeared by the Experiment of Pompions)the Tria prima may be made out of Water; hoping I ſay, that you remember Theſe and the other Things that I formerly repreſented to the ſame purpoſe, Iſhall now add only, that if we doubt not the Truth of ſome of Helmonts Relation, We may ell doubt whether any of theſe Hererogeneities be (Iſay not pre-exiſtent, ſo as to convene together, when a plant or Animal is to be conſtituted but) ſo much as in-exiſtent in the Concrete whence they are obtaind, when the Chymiſis firſt goes about to reſolve it; For, not to inſiſt upon the un- inflamableSpirit of ſuch Concretes, becauſe that may be pretended to be but a mixture of Phlegme and Salt 5 the Oyle or Sulphur of Vegetables or Animals is, according to him, reducible by the help of Lixiviate Salts into Sope ; as that Sope isby the help of repeated Diſtillations from a Caput Mortuum of Chalk into inſipid Water. And as for the ſaline ſubſtance ; Aluali aun mne autem calt addrir that ſeems ſeparable pinguedine in aqueum ſiquofrom mixt bodies 3 the rem, qui tandem mera & ſimſame Helmonts tryals ive us cauſe to think, hat it maybe a production of the Fire, ?lex aqua fit, redu: itur, Cur videre eſt in Sapone, ſ lapide, &rc-) quoties per adiuncla fixa ſemen Pinguedinis deponit Helmont. which by tranſporting and otherwiſe altering the particles of the matter,does bring it to a Saline nature. For I know ( ſayes he, in the place formerly alledgd to another purpoſe) a way to reduce all ſtones into a meer Salt of equal weight with the ſtone whence it was produc'd, and that without any of the leaſt either Sulphur or Aercury; which aſſeveration of my Author would perhaps ſeem leſs incredible to You, if I durſt acquaint You with allI could ſay upon that ſubject. And hence by the way you may alſo conclude that the sulphũr and Mrcury, as they call them, that Chymiſts are wont to obtain from compound Bodies by the Fire, may poſſibly in many Caſes be the productions of it3 ſincẽ if the ſame bodies had been wrought upon by the Agents employd by Helmont, they would have vielded nẽither Sulphur nor Mercury;and thoſe portions of them which the Fire would have preſented Us in the forme of Sulphureous and Mercurial Bodies would have, by Helmonts method, been exhibited to us in the formof Salt. But though ( ſayes Eleutherius] You have alledg'd very. plauſible Arguments againſt the tria Prima, yet Iſee not how it will be poſſible for you to avoid acknoledging that Earth and Waierè are Elementary Ingredients, though not of Mineral Concretes, yet of all Animal and Vegetable Bodies; Since if any of theſe of what ſort ſocver be commirted to Diſtillation, there is regularly and conſtantly ſeparated from it à phlẽgme or aqueous part and a Caput Mortuum or reh. l readily acknowledged  anſweia Carneades) it is not ſo caſy to reject Water and Earth (and eſpecially the former) ast's to reject the Tria Prima, ſfrom beIng the Elements of mixt Bodies; buttis not every difficult thing that is impoſſie I conſider then, as to Water, that the chief Qualities which make men give that name to any vilible Subſtance, are; that it is Fluid or Liquid, and that itis inſipid and inodorous. Now as for the taſt of theſe qualities, Ithink you have never ſeen any of thoſe ſeparated ſubſtances that the Chymiſts call Phlegme which was perſectly devoyd both of Taſt and Snell: and iſ you object; that yet it may be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that ſince the whole Body is Liquid, the maſs Is nothing but Elementary Water faintly imbu'd with ſome of the Saline or SulCc phureous parts of the ſame Concrete, which it retaind with it upon its Separation from the Other Ingredients. To this I anſwer, That this Objoction would not appear ſo ſtong as it is plauſible, it Chymiſts underſtood the Nature of Fluidity and Compactneſſe; and that, as I formerly obſervd, to a Bodies being Fluid there is nothing neceſſary, but that it be divided into parts ſmall enough; and that theſe parts be put into ſuch a motion among themſclves as to glide ſome this way and ſome that way, along cach others Surfaces. So that, although a Concrete were never ſo dry, and had not any Water or other Liquor inexiſtent in it, yet ſuch a Comminution of its parts maybe made, by the fire or other Agents, as to turn a grcat portion of them into Liquor. Ofthis Truth I will give an inſtance, employd by our friend here preſent asone of the moſt conducive of his experiments to llluſtratethe nature of5alts. If you Take, then, ſea ſalt and melt it in the Fire to free it from the aqueous parts, and aſterward diſtill it with a vehement Fire from burnt Clay, or anyother, as dry a Capæ mortuum às you pleafe, you will, as Chymiſts confels, by teaching it drive over a good part of the Salt in the form of a Liquor. And to ſatisfy ſome ingenious men, That a great part of this Liquor was ſtill true Ica ſalt brought by the Operation of the Fire into Corpuſcles ſo ſmall, and perhaps ſo advantageouſly ſhapd, as to be capable of the forme of a Fluid Body, He did in my preſence poure to ſuch ſpiritual ſalts a due proportion of the ſpirit (or ſalt and Phlegme) of Urine, whereby having evaporated the ſuperfluous moiſture, he ſoon obtaind ſuch another Concrete, both as to taſt and ſmell, and caſie ſublimableneſs as common Salt 47moniack, which you know is made up of groſſe and undiſtill'd ſea ſalt united with the ſalts o Urine and of Soot, which two are very neer of kin to each other. And further, to manifeſt that the Cor-. puſcles of ſea ſalt and the Saline ones of Urine retain their ſeveral Natures in this Concrete, He mixt it witha convenient quantity of Salt of Tartar, and committing it to Diſtillation ſoon regaind his ſpirit of Urine in a liquid form byits ſelf, the Sea ſalt ſtaying behind with the Sale of Tarta. Whereſore it is very poſſible that dry Bodies mayby the Fire be reCc ducd to Liquors without any ſeparation of Elements, but barely by a certain ind of Diſſipation and Comminution of the matter, hereby its parts are brought into a new ſtate. And iſ it be ſtill objected, that the Phlegme of mixt Bodies muſt be reputed water, becauſe ſo weak a taſt needs but a very ſmall proportion of Salt to impartit; It may be replyd, that for ought appears, common Salt and divers orher bodies, though they be diſtilld nęver ſo dry, and in never ſo cloſe Veſſels, will yield each of them pretty ſtore of a Liquor, wherein though (as I lately noted) Saline Corpuſcles abound, Yet there is beſides a large proportion of Phlegme, as may eaſily be diſcovered by coagulating the Saline Corpuſcles with any convenient Body; as I lately told you, our Friend coagulateqd part of the Spirit of Salt with Spirit of Urine: and as I have divers times ſeparated a ſalt from Oyle of Vitriol it ſelfſtthough a very ponderon Liquor and drawn from a ſaine body) by boyling it with a juſt quantity of Mercury, and then waſhing the newly coagulated ſalt from the Precipitate withfair Water. Now to what can we motre probably aſcribe this plenty of aqueous Subſtance afſorded usby the Diſtillation of ſuch bodies, than unto this, That among the various operations of the Fire upon the matter of a Concrete, divers particles of that matter are reduc'd to ſucha ſhape and bigneſſe as is requiſite to compoſe ſuch a Liquor as Chymiſts;are wont to call Phlegme or Watcr. How Iconjecture this change may be effected, tis neither nece ſſary for me to tell you, nor poſſible to do ſo without a much longer diſcourſe then were now ſeaſonable. But Ideſire you would with me reſlect upon what Iformerly told you concerning the change of Quickſilver into Water; For that Water having but a very faint taſt, ifany whit more than divers of thoſe liquors that Chymiſs referr to Phlegme ; By that experiment it ſeems evident, that even a metalline body, and therefore much more ſuch as are but Vegetable or Animal, may by a ſimple operation of the Fire be turnd in great part into Water. And ſince thoſe I diſpute with are not yet able out of Gold, or Silver, or divers other Concretes to ſeparate any thing like Water; I hope I maybe allowd to conclude againſt Them, that water it ſelf isnot an Univerſal and pre- exiſtent Ingredient of Mixt Bodies. But as for thoſe Chymiſts that, Suppoſing ith me the Truth of what Helmont relates of the Alkaheſt’s wonderſul Effects, have a right to preſs me with his Authority concerning them, and to alledge that he could Tranſmute all reputedly mixt Bodies into inſipid and meer Water;3 To thoſe I ſhall repreſent, That thoughhis Affirmations conclude ſtrongly againſt the Vulgar Chymiſts Cagaint whom I have not therefore ſcrupd to Employ Them) ſince they Evince that the Commonly reputed Principles or Ingredients of Things are not Pormanent and indeſtructible, ſince they may be further reducd into Inſipid Phlegme differing ſrom them all; Yet till we can be allowd to examine this Liquor, I think it not unreaſonable to doubt whether it be not ſomething elſe then meer Water. For I find not any other reaſon given by Helmont of his Pronouncing it ſo, then that it is inſipid. Now Sapour being an Accident or an Affection of matter that relates to our Tongue, Palate, and other Organs of Taſt, it may very poſſibly be, that the ſmall Parts of a Body may be of ſuch a Size and Shape, as either by their extream Littleneſs, or by their ſlenderneſs, or by their Figure, to be unable to pierce into and make a perceptible Impreſſion upon the Nerves or Membranous parts of the Organs of Talt, and what may be fit to work otherwiſe upon divers other Bodies than meer Warter can, and conſequently to Diſcloſe it ſelf to be of a Nature farr enough from Elementary. In Silke dyed Red or of any other Colour, whilſt many Contiguous Thrcads makes up a skein, the Colour of the Silke is conſpicuous; but if only a very ſew of them be lookt upon, the Colour will appear much fainter then before. But if You take out one ſimple Thread, you ſhall not eafily be able to diſcern any Colour at all; So ſubtile an Object having not the Force to make upon the Optick Nerve an Impreſſion great enough to be taken Notice of. It is alſo obſervd, that the beſt ſort of Oyl-Olive is almoſt taſtleſs, and yet I need nor tell you how exceedingly diſtant in Nature Oyle is from VVater. The Liquor into which Itold you, upor the Relation of Lullj, c and Eye- witneſs that Mercury might be Tranſmuted, has ſometimes but a very Languid, if any Taſt, and yet its Operations even upon ſome Mineral Bodies are very peculiar. Quickſilver it ſelf alſo, though the Corpuſcles it conſiſts of be ſo very ſmall as to get into the Pores oſ that Cloſeſt and compacteſt of Bodies, Gold, is yet (you know) altogether Taſtleſs. And our Helmont ſeveral times rells us, that fair Water wherein a little  antity f Quickſilver has lain for ſome time, though it acquire no certain Taſt or other ſenſible Quality from the Quickſilver Yet it has a power to deſtroy wormes in humane Bodies;3 which he does much, but not cauſeleſsly extoll. And I remember, a great Lady, that had been Eminent for her Beauty in Divers Courts, confeſ/d to me, that this inſipid Liquor was of all innocent waſhes for the Face the beſt that ſhe ever met with. And here let me conclude my Diſcourſe, concerning ſuch waters or Liquors as I have hitherto been examining, with theſe two Conſiderations. VVhereof the firſt is, That by reaſon of our being wont to drink nothing but Wine, Bear, Cyder, or other ftrongly taſted Liquors, there may be in ſeveral of theſe Liquors, that are wont to paſs for inſipid Phlegme, very peculiar and Diſtinct, Taſts though unhecded (and perhaps not to be perciv'd) by Us. For to omit what Naturaliſts aſfirm of Apes, (and which probably may be true oſ divers other Animals) that they have a more exquiſite palate than Men: among Men themſclves, thoſe that are wont to drink nothing but water may (as I have tryd in my ſelf) Diicrn very ſenſibly a great Difference of Taſts in ſeveral waters, which one un-accuſtomed to drink water would take to be all alike inſipid,. And this is the firit of my two Conſiderations; the Other is, That it is not impoſſible that the Corpuſcles into which a body is diſſipated by the Fire mayby the Operation of the ſame fire have their figures ſo altered, or may be by aſſociations with one another brought into little Maſſes of ſuch a Size and Shape, as not to be fit to make ſenſible Impreſſions on the Tongue. And that you may not think ſuch alterations impoſſible, be pleaſed to conſider with me, that not only the ſharpeſt spirit of Vinager having diſſolved as much Corall as it can, vill Coagulate withit into a Subſtance, which though ſoluble in watcr, like ſalt, is incomparably leſs ſtrongly Taſted then the Vinager was before ; but (What is more conſiderable) though the Acid ſalts that are carried up with Quickſilver in the preparation of common ſublimate are ſo ſharp, that being moiſtened with water it will Corrode ſome of the Metals themſelves; yet this Corroſive Sublimate being twice or thrice re- ſublimd with a full proportion of inſipid Quickſilver, Conſtitutes  as you know) that FEactitious Concrete, which the Chymiſts call Mercuriis dulcis;3 not becauſe it is ſieet, but becauſe the ſharpneſs of the Corroſive Salts ĩs ſo taken away by their Combination with the Mercurial Corpuſcles, that the whole mixture when it is prepard is judgd to be inſipid. 3l And thus (continues Carneades) having given you ſome Reaſons why I refuſe to admit Elementary water for a conſtant Ingredient of Mixt Bodies, It vill be eaſie for me to give you an Account why Ialſo reject Earth. r For firſt,it may vell be ſuſpected that many Subſtances paſs among Chymiſts under the name of Earth, becauſe, like it, they are Dry, and Heavy, and Fix, which yet are very farr ſrom an Elementary Nature. This you will not think improbable, If you recall to mind what I formerly told xu concerning what Chymiſts call the Dead Earth of things, and eſpecially touching the copper to be drawn ſrom the Caput Mortuum of Vitriol3 And if alſo you allow me to ſubjoyn a caſual but memorable Experiment made by Johannes Agricola upon the Terra Damnata of Brimſtone. Our Author then tells us (in his notes upon Pepius,) that in the year 1621 he made an Oyle of Sulphur; the remaining Fæces he reverberated in a moderate Fire fourteen dayes; aſterwards he put them well luted up in a VVind Oven, and gave them a ſtrong Fire for ſix hours, purpoſing to calcine the Fæces to a perfect Whiteneſs, that he might make ſometing clſe out of them. But coming to break the por, he found above but very litile Fæces, and thoſe Grey and not White; but beneath there lay a fine Red Regulis which he firſt marvelld at and knew not what to mae of, being well aſſured that not the leaſt thing, beſides the Faæces of the Sulphur, came into the pot; and that the Sulphur it ſelf had only been diſſolv'd in Linſced Oyle; this Regulus he found heavy and malleable almoſt as Lead; having caud a Goldſmith to draw him a Wire of it, he found it to be of the Faireſt copper, àand ſo rightly colourd, that a Jew of Prague offerd him a great price for it. And of this Metal he ſayes he had 12 bih ( or ſix ounces) out of one pound of Aſnhcs or Fæces. And this Story may well Incline us to ſuſpect that ſince the Copait Mortumm of the Sulphur was kept ſo long in the fire before it was found to be any thing elſc then a Terra dampata, thcre may be divers other Reſidences of Bodies which are wont to paſs only for the Terreſtrial Faces of things, and therefore to be thrown away as ſoon as the Diſtillation or Calcination of the Bodythat yiclded them is ended; which yet if they were long and Skilſully examin'd by the fire ould appear tobe differing from Elementary Earth. And Ihave taken notice of the unwarrantable forwardneſs of common Chymiſts to pronounce things uſeleſs Faæces, by obſerving how often they reject the Caput Mortuum of Verdegreaſe; which is yet ſo farr from deſerving that Name, that not only by ſtrong fires and convenient Additaments it may inſome hours be reducd into copper, but with a certain Flux Powder I ſometimes make for Recreation, Ihave in two or three minutes obrain'd that Metal from it. To which I may add, that having for cryall ſake kept Venetian Taclk in no leſs a heat than that of a glaſs Furnace, I found after all the Brunt of the fire it had indurd, the remaining Body though brittle and diſcolourd, had not loſt very much of its former Bulke, and ſeemd ſtill to be nearer of in to Taldk than to meer Earth. And I remember too, that a candid Mineraliſt, famous for his Skill in trying of Oars, requeſting me one day to procure him a certain American Mincral Earth of a Virtueſo, who he thought would not refuſe me; Ienqui'd of him why he ſcem?d ſo greedy of it? he confeſsd to me that this Gentleman having brought that Earth to the publick Say-Maſters s and they upon their being unable by any means to bringit to fuſion or make it ſly away, he Cthe Relator) had procurd a little of it3 and having tryd it with a peculiar Flux ſcparated from it neer a third part of pure Gold 3 ſo great miſtakes may be committed in haſtily concluding things to be Uſeleſſe Earth. Next, it maybe ſuppos'd, That as in the Reſolution of Bodies by the Fire ſome of the diſſipated Parts may, by their various occurſion occaſiond by the hear, be brought to ſtick together ſo cloſely as to conſtituteCorpuſcles too heavy for the Fire to carry away; the aggregate of which Corpuſcles is wont to be call'd Aſhes or Earrh3 So other Agents may reſolve the Concrete into Minute Parts, aſter ſo differing a manner as not to produce any Caput mortuum,or dry and heavy Body. As youmay remember Helmont above informd us, that with his great Diſſolvent he divided a Coal into two liquid and volatile Bodies, æquiponderant to the Coal, without any dry or fixt Reſidence at all. And indeed, Iſee not why it ſhould be neceſſary that all Agents that reſole Bodies into portions of differingly qualifrd matter mut work on them the ſame way, and divide them into juſt ſuch parts, both for nature and Number, as the Fire diſſipates them into. For ſince, as I noted before, the Bulk and ſhape of the ſmall Parts of bodies, together with their Fitneſs and Unfitneſs to be eaſily put into Motion, may make the liquors or other ſubſtances ſuch Corpuſcles compoſe, as much to differ from cach other as do ſome of the Chymical principles: Why may not ſomething happen in this caſe, not unlike what is uſuall in the groſſer diviſions of bodies by Mechanical Inſtruments? Where we ſee that ſome Tools reduce Wood, for Inſtance, into darts of ſeveral ſhapes, bigneſſe,and other qualities, as Hatchets and Wedges divide it into groſſer parts; ſome more long and ſlender, as ſplinters; and ſome more thick and irregular, as chips; but all of conſiderable bulk; but Files and Saws makes a Comminution of it ĩnto Duſt; which, as all the others, is of the more ſolid ſort oſparts3 whereas others divide it into long and broad, but thin and ſloxible parts, as do Planes: And of this kiad of parts it ſclf there is alſo a variety according to the Difference of the Tools employd to work on the Wood; the ſhavings made by the ylane being in ſome things differing from thoſe ſhives or thin and ſlexible pieces of wood that are obtaindby Borers, and theſe from ſome others obtainable by other Tools. Some Chymical Examples applicable to this purpoſc I have elſewhere given you. To which I may add, that whereas in a mixture of Sulphur and Salt of Tartar well melted and incorporated toether, the action of pure ſpirit of wine Higcſed on it is to ſeparate the ſulphureous from the Alcalizate Parts, by diſſolving the former and leaving the latter, the action of Wine ( probably upon the ſcore of its copious Phlegme) upon the ſame mixture is to divide it into Corpuſcles conſiſting of both Alcalizate and Sulphureous Parts united. And ifit be objected, that this is but a Factitious Concrete; Ianſwer, that however the inſtance may ſerve to illuſtrate whatI Rioposũ, if not to prove it; and that ature her ſelf doth in the bowels of the Earth make Decompounded Bodies, as we ſce in Vitriol, Cinnaber, and even in Sulphur it ſelf 3 Iwill not urge ihac the Fire divides new Milk ino five dilfering Subſtances; but Runnet and Acid Liquors divide it into a Coagulated matter and a thin Whey: And on the other ſide churning divides it into Butter and Butter- milk, which may either of them be yct reduc'd to other ſubſtances differing from the former. Iwill not preſſe this, Ilay, nor other inſtancs of this Nature, becauſe I cannot in few words anſwer what may be objected, that theſe Concretes ſequeſtred withour the help of the Fire may by it be further divided into Hypoſtatical Principles. But Iwill rather repreſent, That whereas the ſame ſpirit of Wine will diſſociare the Parts of Camphire, and make them one Liquor with it ſelf; Aqua Fortis will alſo disjoyn them, and put them into motion; but ſo as to keep them together, and yet alter their Texture into the form of an Oyle. I know alſo an uncompounded Liquor, that an extraordinary Chymiſt Would not allow to be ſo much as Saline, which doth(as I have tryd) from Coral it ſelf (us fixt as divers judicious writers aſſ re that Concrete to be ) not only obtain a noble Tincture, without the Intervention of Nitre or oDd ther Salts; but will carry over the Tincture in Diſtillation. And if ſome reaſons did not forbid me, I could now tell you of a Menſtruum I make my ſelf, that doth more odly diſſociate the parts of Minerals very ſixt inthe fire. 50 that it ſeems not incredible, that thare maybe ſome Agent or way of Operation found, whereby this or that Concrete, if not all Eirme Bodies, may be reſolvd into paris ſo very minute and ſo unapt to Itick cloſe to one another, that none of them may be fixt enough to ſtay bchind in a ſtrong Fire, and to be incapable o? Diſtillation nor conſequently to be look d upon as Earth. But to return to Helmont, the ſame Authour ſomewhere ſupplys me with another Argument again?t the Earth's being ſuch an Element as my Adverſaries would have it. For he ſomewhere affirms, that he canreduce all the Terreſtrial parts of mixt bodies into inſipid water 3 whence we may argue againſt the Earths being one of their Elements, even from that Notion oſ Elements which you may remember Philoporus recited out of Aristotle himſelf, when he lately diſputed for his Chymiſis againſt Themiſtius, And here we may on this occaſion conſider, that ſince a Body from which the Fire hath driven away its looſer parts is wont to be look d upon as Earth, upon the Account of its being endow'd with both theſe qualities, Taſtleſſeneſſe and Fixineſſe, (for Salt of Tartar though Fixt paſſcs not among the Chymiſts for Earth, becauſetis ſtrongly Taſted) if it be in the power of Natural Agents to deprive the Caput Mortuum of a body of either of thoſe two Qualities, or to give them both to a portion of matter that had them not both before, the Chymiſts ill not eaſily define what part oſa reſolvd Concrete is earth, and make out, that that Earth is a primary, ſimple, and indeſtructible Body. Now there are ſome caſes wherein the more skilful of the Vulgar Chymiſts themſelves pretend to be able, by repeated Cohobations and other fit Operations, to make the Diſtilled parts ofa Concrete bring its own Caput Mortuum over the Helme, in the forme of a Liquor 3 in which ſtatè being both Fluid and Volatile, you will eaſily believe it would not be taken for Earth. And indeed by a skilful, but not Vulgar, way of managing ſome Concretes, there may be more effected in this kind, then you perhaps would eaſily think. Andon the other ſide, that cither Earth may be Generated, or at leaſt Bodies that did not betore apear to be neer Totally Earth, may he ſo alter'd as to paſs for it, ſeems very poſſible, i Helmont Novi item modos quibus totum Salpetia in terram convertitur, totumque Sulphur ſemel diſſolutum fixetur in Pulvecrem terreum. Helmont in Compl. atque Miſt. Elementor. Sect. 24. have done that by Art which he mentions in ſeveral places; eſpecially where He. ſaycs that he knowes wayes whereby Sulphur once diſſold is all of it fix'd into a Terreſtrial Powder, and the whole Bodie of salt- Petre may be turnd into Earth: Which laſt he elſewhere ſayes is Done by the Odour nly of a certain Sulphureous Fire. And in another place He mentions one way of doing this, which I cannot give you an Account of; becauſe the Materialls I had prepar'd for Trying it, were by a Servants miſtake unhappily thrown away. And theſe Laſt Arguments may be confirmd by the Experiment I have often had occaſion to mention concerning the Mint I producd out of Water. deletius concerning the Growth of Animals alſo, Nouriſ'd but by Water, which I rememberd not to mention, when Idiſcoursd to you about the Production of things out of Water. This Diligent VVriter then in his inſtructive book of fiſhes, affirmes That his Wife ept a fiſh in a Glaſs of water without any other Food for three years; in which ſpace it was conſtantly augmented, till at laſt it could not come out of the Place at which it was put in, and at ]ength was too big for the glaſs it ſelf though that were of a large capacity. And becauſe there is no juſt reaſon to doubt, that this: Fiſh, if Diſtilld, would have yielded the like differing ſubſtances with other Animals: And However, becauſe the Mint which Ihad out of water afforded me upon Diſtillation a good quantity of Charcoal, I think I may from thence inferr, that Earthit ſelf may be produc'd out of Water; or iſ you pleaſe, that water may be tranſmuted into Earth; and conſequently, that though it could be prov'd that Earth is an Ingredient actually in- exiſtent in the Vegetable and Animal Bodies whence it may be obtaind by Fire: yet it would not neceſſarily follow, that Earth as a pre- exiltent Element Does with orther Principles convene to make up thoſe Bodies whence it ſeemę to have been ſeparated. Aſter all is ſaid (ſayes Eleutherius) I have yet ſomething to Object, that I cannot but think conſiderable, ſince Carneades Himſelf alledgd it as ſuch; for, (continues Eleutheri ſmilingd I muſt make bold to iry whether you can as Juckily anſwer your own Arguments, as thoſe of your Antagoniſts, I'mean (purſues he) that part of your Conce ſſiuns, wherein you cannot but remember that you ſupply'd your Adverſaries with an Example to prove that there may be E]ementary Bodies, by taking Notice that Gold may be an Ingredient in a multitude of differing Mixtures, and yet retain ĩts Nature, notwithſtanding all that the Chymiſts by their Fires and Corroſive Waters are able to do to Deſtroy it, I ſufficiently intimated to you at that time (replies Careades) that Iproposd this Example, chieſly to ſnew you how Nature may be Conceived to have made Elements, not to prove that ſhe actually has made any3 And you know, that a poſſe ad eſſe the Infcrence will not hold. But (continues Carneades) to anſwer more directly to the Obje ction drawn from Gold, I muſt tell You, that though I know very well that divers of the more ſober Chymiſts have complaind of the Vulgar Chymiſis, as of Mountebanks or Cheats, for pretending ſo vainly, as hitherto they have done, to Deſtroy Gold;3 Yet I knowa certain Menstruum (which our Friend has made, and intends ſhortly to communicate to the Ingenicus) of ſo piercing and powerſull a Quality, That if notwithſtanding much care, and ſome sill, I did not much deceive my ſelf, Ihave with it really deſtroyd even refid Gold, and brought it intoa Metalline Body of another colour and Nature, as Ifound by Tryals purpoſely made. And if ſome juſt Conſiderations did not for the preſent Forbid it, I could Perchance here ſhew you by another Experiment or Two of my own Trying, that ſuch Menſtruums may be made as to entice away and retain divers parts, ſrom Bodies, which even the more Judicious and Experiend Spagyriſis have proDd4 nouncd irreſoluble by the Fire. Though (wriich I Delire you would mark) in neither of theſe Inſtances, the Gold or Precious Stones be Analyyd into any of the Tria Prima, but only Reducd to new Concretes. And indecd there is a great Diſparity betwixt the Operations of the ſeveral Agents whereby the Parts of a Body come to be Dillipated. As if (for Inſtance) you diſſolve the rurer ſort of Vitriol in common Water, the Liquor will ſwallow up the Mineral, anl ſo Diſſociate its Corpuſcles, that they will ſeem to make up but one Liquor with thoſe of the water; and yet cach of theſe Corpuſcles retains its Nature and Texture, and remains a Vitriolate and Compounded Body. But if the ſame Vitriol be expoſed to a ſtrong Fire, it will then be divided not only, as before, into ſmaller parts, but into Heterogeneous Subſtances, cach of the Vitriolate Corpuſcles that remaind entire in the water, being ĩt ſelfupon the Deſtruction of its former Texture diſſipated or divided into new Particles of differing Qualitics. But Inſtances more fitlv applicable to this purpoſe, I have turn to what Itold you abour the Deſtruction of Gold, that Experiment Invites me to Repreſent to you, that Though there weie cither Saline, or Sulphureous, or Terrelſtrial Portions of Matter, whole parts were ſo ſmall, ſo firmly united rogether, or of a figure ſo ſit to make them cohcre to one another, (as we ſee that in quickſilver broken into little Globes, ihe Parts brought to touch One another do immediately re- imbedy) that neither the Fire, nor the uſual Agents employd by Chymiſts, are picrceing enough to divide their Parts, ſo as to deſtroy the Texture of the ſingle Corpuſcles; yet it would nor nec ſſarily follow, That ſuch Permanent Bodics were Elementary, ſince tis poſible there may be Agents ſound in Nature, ſome of whoſe perts may be of ſuch a Size and Figure as to take better Hold of ſome parts of theſe ſeemingly Elementary Corpuſcles than theſe parts do of the reſt, and Conſequently may carr away ſuch parts with them, and ſo diſſolve the Tex ure of the Corpuſcle by pulling its parts aſunder. And ifit b ſaid, that at leaſt we may this way diſcover the Elementary Ingredienis of things Things, by obſerving into what Subſtances theſe Corpuſcles that were reputed pure are divided; I anſwer, that it is not neceſſary that ſuch a Diſcovery ſhould be practicable. For if the Particles of the Diſſolvent do take ſuch firme hold of thoſe of the Diſſolved Body, they muſt conſtitute together new Bodies, as well as Deſtroy the Old3 and the ſtricke Lnion, which according to this H;p0theſis may well be ſuppos'd betwixt the Parts of the Emergent Body, will mae it as Little to be Expected that they ſhould be pull'd aſunder, but by little Parts of matter, that to Divide them Aſſociate Themſelves and ſtick extreamly cloſe to thoſe of them which they ſever from their Former Adherents. Beſides that it is not impoſſible, that a Corpuſcle ſupposd to be Elementary may have its Nature changed, without ſuffering a Divorce of its parts, barely by a new Texture Effccted by ſome powerſull Agent; as I formerly told you, the ſame portion of matter may eaſily by the Operation of the Fire be turnd at Pleaſure into the form of a Brittle and Tranſparent, or an Opacous and Malleable Body. And indeed, it you conſider how farr the barc Change of Texture, whether made by Art or Nature (or rather by Nature with or without the aſſiſtance of man) cango in producing ſuch New Qualities in the ſame parcel of matter, and how many inanimate Bodies (ſuch as are all the Chymical productions of the Fire) we know are Denominated 2nd Diſtinguiſd not ſo much by any Imaginary Subſtantial Form, as by the agsregatc of theſe Qualities. If you conſider theſe Things, I ſay, and that the varying of either the figure, or the Size, or the Motion, or the Situation, or Connexion of the Corpuſcles whereof any of theſe Bodies is compos d, may alter the Fabrick of it, you will poſſibly be invited to ſuſpect, with me, that there is no great necd that Nature ſhould alwayes have Elements before hand, whereof to make ſuch Bodies as we call mixts. And rhat it is not ſo eaſie as Chymifts and others have hitherto Imagin'd, to diſcern, among the many differing Subſtances that may without any extraordinary skill be obtaind from the ſame portion of matter, Which ought to be eſteemed excluſively to all the reſt, its in-exiſtent Elementary Ingredients; much leſſe to.determine what Primogeneal and Simple Bodies convened together to compoſc it. To exemplity this, I ſhall add to what Ihave already on ſeveral occaſions Repreſented, but this ſingle inſtance. You may remember (Eleatheriu) that I formerly intimated to you, that beſides Mint and Pompions, I produced divers other Vegẽtables of very differing Natures out of Water. Whereſore you will not, I preſume, think it inconZruous to ſuppoſe, that when a ſlender Vineſlip is ſet into the ground, and takes root, there it may likewiſe receive its Nutriment ſrom the water attracted out of the earth by his roots, or impell'd by the warmth of the ſun, or preſſure of the ambient air into the pores of them. And this you will the more eaſily believe, if you ever obſerv'd what a ſtrange quantity of Water will Drop out of a wound given to the Vine, in a convenient place, at a ſealonable time in the Spring; and ho little of Taſt or Smell this Aqua Vitis,as Phyſitians call it, is endow'd with, notwithſtanding what concoction or alteration it may receive in its paſſage through the Vine, to diſcriminate it ſrom common Water. Suppoſing then this Liquor, at its firſt entrance into the roots oſthe Vine, to be common Water; Let Us a little conſider how many various Subſtances may be obtain d from it; though to do ſo, I muſt repeat ſomewhat that I had a former occaſion to touch upon. And firſt, this Liquor being Digeſted in the plant, and aſſimilated by the ſeveral parts oſ it, is tur'd into the Wood, Bark, Pith, Leaves, &c. of the Vine 3 The ſame Liquor may be ſurther dryd, and faſhond into Vine- buds, and theſe a while after are advanced unto ſour Grapes, which expreſſd yield Verjuice, a Liquor very differing in ſeveral qualities both from Wine and other Liquors obtainable from the Vine: Theſe ſoure Grapes being by the heat of the Sun concocted and ripened, turne to well taſted Grapes3 The ſe if dry'd in the Sun and Diſtill)d, afford a fætid Oyle and a piercing Empy;reumatical Spirit, burt not a Vinous Spirit 3 Theſe dry’d Grapes or Raiſins boyld in a convenient proportion of Water make a weet Liquor, which being betimes diſtill d afford an Oyle and Spirit much like thoſe of the Raiſins themſclves; If the juice of the Grapes be ſquecæ'd out and put to Ferment, it firſt becomes a ſweet and turbid Liquor, then grows leſſo ſweet and more clear, and then affords in common Diſtillations not an Oyle but a Spitit, which, though inflamable like Oyle, differs much fromit, in that it is nò fat, and that it will readily mingle with Water. Ihave likewiſe without Addition obtaind in proceſſe of time (and by an eaſie way which I am read to teach you) from one of the nobleſt ſorts of Wine, pretty ſtore of pure and curiouſly figured Cryſtals of Sat together with a great proportion of a Liquor as ſweet almoſt as Hony; and theſe I obtained not from Muſt, but True and ſprightly Wine; beſides the Vinous Liquor, the fermented Juice of Grapes is partly turned into liquid Dreg, or Leeze, and partly into that cruſt or dry feculancv that is commonly called Tartar; and this Tartar may by the Fire be eaſily divided into five diſfering ſubſtances; four of which are not Aciã and the other not ſo manifeſtly Acid as the Tartar it ſelf; The ſame Vinous Juice aſter ſome time, eſpecially if it be not carefully kept, Degenerates into that very ſour Liquor called Vinegar; from which you ma obtain by the Firc a Spirit and a Cryſtalline Salt differing enough ſrom the Spirit and Lixiviate Salt of Tartar And if you pour the Dephlegm'd Spirit of the Vinegar upon the Salt of Tartar, there will be produc d ſuch a Conflict or Ebullition as it there were ſcarce two more contrary Bodies in Nature; and oftentimes in this Vinager you may obſerve part of the marter to be turned into an innumerable company of ſwimming Animals, which our Friend having divers years ago obſcrved, hath in on of his Papers taught us how to diſcover clearly without the help of a ſicro ſcope. Into all theſe various Schemes of matter, or differingly Qualifyed Bodies, beſides divers others thatI purpoſely forbear 1o mention, may the Warer that is imbib d by the roots of the Vine be brought, partly by the ſormative power of the plant, and partly by fupervenient Agents or Cauſes, withour the viſible concurrence of any extraneons Ingredient; but if we be allowed to add to the Productions of this tranſmuted Water a ſew other ſbſlances, wæ may much encreaſe the Variety of ſuch Bodies; although iĩn this ſecond ſort of Productions, the Vinous parts ſecm ſcarce to retain any thing of the much more fix'd Bodies wherewith they were mingld, but only to have by their Mixture with them acquird ſuch a Diſpoſition, that in their receſs occaſion'd by the Fire they came to be alterd as to ſhape, or Bigneſs, or both, and aſſociated after a New manner. Thus, as I formerly told you, Idid by the Addition of a Caput Mortusm of Antimony, and ſome other Bodies unfit for Diſtillation, obtain ſrom crude Tartar, ſtore of a very Volatile and Cryſtalline Salt, differing very much in ſmell and other Qualities from the uſuall ſakes of Tartar. But ( ſayes Eleutherim, interrupting him at thee Words) if you have no reſtraint upon you, I would very gladly before you go any further, be more particularly informd, how you make this Volatile Salt, becauſe ſ you know) that ſuch Multitudes of Chymiſts have by a ſcarce imagimable Variety of wayes, attempted in Vain the Volatilization of the Salt of Tartar, that divers learned Spagyri fts ſpeak as iſ it were impoſſible, to make any thing out of Tartar, that ſnall be Volatile ina Saline Forme, or as ſome of them expreſs it, in forma ſicca. Iam very farr from thinking (anſwers Carneades) that the Salt I have mentiond is that which Paracelſu and Helmont mean when they ſpeak of Sal Tartari Volatile, and aſcribe ſuch great things to it. For the Salt Iſpeak of falls extreamly ſhort of thoſe Virtues; not ſeeming in its Taſt; Smel, and other Obvious Qualities, to differ very much ( though ſomething it do differ) from Salt of Harts-horn, and other Volatile Salts drawn ſrom the Diſtill'd Parts o Animals. Nor have I yer made Tryals enough to be ſure, that it is a pure Salt of Tartar without participating any thing at all of the Nitre, or Antimony. But becauſe it ſcoms more likely to proceed from the Tartar, than from any of the other Ingredients, and becauſe the Experiment is in it ſelf not Ignoble, and Luciferous enough ( as ſhewing a new way to produce a Volatile Salt contrary to Acid Salts from Bodies that othetwiſe are Oblervd to yield no ſuch Liquor, but either only, or chiefly, Acid ones,) I ſhall, to ſatisſic you, acquaint you beforc any of my other Friends with the way Inow uſe (for Ihave formerly us'd ſome others) to make it. Take then of good Antimony, SaltPetre and Tartar, o cach an cqual weight, and of Quicklime Halfe the Weight of any one of them; let theſe be powderd and well mingl'd; this done, vou muſt have in readineſs a long neck or Retort of Earth, which muſt be placd in a Furnace for a naked Fire, and have at the top of it a hole of a convenient Bigneſs, at which you may caſt in the Mixture, and preſently ſtop it up again; this Veſſcl being fitted with a large Receiver muſt have Fire made undcr it, till the bottom of the ſides be red hot, and then you muſt caſt in the above prepard Mixture, by aboutr halſe a ſpoonfull more or leſs) at a time, at the hole made for that purpoſe; which being nimbly ſtopt, the Fumes will paſs into the Receiver and condenfe there into a Liquor, that being rectif'd will be of a pure golden Colour, and carry up thar colour to a great height; this Spirit abounds in the SaltI told you of, part of which may caſily enough be ſeparated by the way Iuſe in ſuch caſes, which is, to put the Liquor into a glaſs Egę~, or bolthead with a long and narrow Neck. For if this be plac d a little inclining in hot ſand, there will ſublime up a fine Salt, which, as I told you, I find to be much of kin to the Volatile Salts of Animals: For like them it has a Saltiſh, not an Acid Salt; ĩt hiſſes upon the Affuſion of spirit oſ Nitre, or Oyle of Vitriol; it precipitates Corals Diſſolvd in Spirit of Vinager ; it turncs the blew Syrup of Violets immediately green; it preſently turnes the Solution of Sublimate into a Miikie whiteneſs; and in ſumm, has divers Operations like thoſe that I have obſervd in that ſort of Salts to which Ihave reſembled it: and is ſo Volatile, that for Diſtinction ſake, I call it Tartari Fugitivus. Wnhat virtues it may have in Phyſick I have not yet had the opportunity tò Try; but Iam apt to think they ill not be deſpicable. And beſides that a very Ingenious Friend of mine tells me ſe hath done great matters againſt the ſtore, with abreparation not very much Differing from ours, a very Experiencd Germane Chymiſt finding that I was unacquainted with the wayes of making this ſalt, told me that in a great City in his Country, a noted Chymiſt prizes it ſo highly, that he had a while ſince procurd a Priviledge from the Magiſtrates, that none but He, or by his Licence, ſhould vent a Spirit made almoſt aſter the ſame Way with mine, ſave that he leaves out one of the Ingredients, namely the Quick-lime. But, continues Carneades, to reſume my Former Diſcourſe where your Curioſity interrupted it; Tis alſo a common practice in France to bury thin Plates of Copper in the Marc (as the French call it) or Husks of Grapes, whence the Juice has been ſquecZd out in the Wine-preſs, and by this means the more ſaline parts of thoſe Husks working by little and litile upon the Copper, Coagulate Themſclves with it imto that Blewiſh Green Subſtance we in Engliſh call Verdizreaſe. Of which Itherefore take Notice, becauſe having Diſtilld it in æ Naked Fire, I found as I expected, that by the Aſſociation of the Saline with the Metalline parts, the former were ſo ãlterd, that the Diſtilld Liquor, even vithout Rectification, ſeemd by ſinell and Taſt, ſtrong almoſt like Aqua Fortis, and very much ſurpaſſed the pureſt and moſt Recti'd Spirit of Vinager that ever I made. And this Spirit I therefore aſcribe to the ſalt of the Husks alter'd by their Co- Mixture with the copper ( though the Fire aſterwards Divorce and Tranſmute them) becauſe I found this later in the bottom of the Retort in the Forme of a Crocus or rediſh powder: And becauſe Copper is of too ſluggiſh a Nature to be forcd over in cloſe Veſſels by no ſtronger a heat. And that which is alſo ſomewhat Remarkable in the Deſtillation of good Verdigreaſe, (or at leaſt of that ſort that Iusd) is this, that I Never could obſerve that iĩt yielded me any oyl, Cunleſs a little black ſlime which was ſeparated in Rectification may paſs for Oyle) though both Tartar and Vinagen ſeſpecially the former) will by Deitillation yield a Moderate proportion of it. If likewiſe you pour Spirit of Vinager upon Calcid Lead, the Acid Salt of the Liquor will by its Commixture with the Metalline parts, though Inſipid, acquire in a few hours a more than Saccharine ſweetneſs3 and theſe Saline parts being by a ſtrong Fire Deſtill'd from the Lead wherewith they were imbodyd, will,as Iformerly alſo noted to a Different purpoſe, leave the Metal behind them alterd in ſome qualitics ſrom what it vas, and will themſelves aſcend, partly in the Forme of an unctuous Body or Oyle, partly in that of Phlegme; but for the greateſt part in the Forme of a ſubtile Spirit, indowd, beſides divers new Qualitices which Iam not now willing to take notice of, witha ſtrong ſmeil very much other than that of Vinager, and a piercing taſt quite differing both from the Sowerneſs of the Spirit of Vinager, and the Sweetneſs of the Sugar of Lead. To be ſhort, As the difference of Bodies may depend meerly upon that of the ſchemes whereinto their Common matter is put 3 So the ſeeds of Things, the Fire and the other Agents are able to alter the minute parts of a Body (either by breaking them into ſmaller ones of differing ſnapes, or by Uniting together theſe Fragments with the unroken Corpuſcles, or ſuch Corpuſcles among Themſelves) and the ſame Agents partly by Altering the ſhape or bigneſs of the Conſtituent Corpuſcles of a Body, partly by driving away ſome of them, partly by blending others with them, and partly by ſome new manner of connecting them, may give the whole portion of matter a new Texture of ĩts minute parts3 and thereby make it deſerve a new and Diſtinct name. So that according as the ſmall parts of matter recede from each other, or work upon each other, or are connected together after this or that determinate manner, a Body of this or that denomination is produced, as ſome other Body happens thereby to be alterd or deſtroyd. Since then thoſe things which Chymiſts produce by the help of the Fire are but inanimate Bodies; ſince ſuch fruits of the Chymiſts skill differ from one another but in ſo few qualities that we ſee plainly that by fire and other Agenis we can employ, we can eaſily enough work as great alterations upon matter, as thoſe that are requiſite to change one of theſe Chymical Productions into another; Since the ſame portion of matter may without being Compounded with any extraneous Body, or at leaſt Element, be made to put on ſuch a vaEc4 riety of formes, and conſequently to be (ſucceſſivelv) turnd into ſo many differing Bodies. And ſince the matter cloatid with ſo many differing formes was originally but water, and that in its paſſage thorow ſo many transformations, It was never reduc'd into any of thoſe ſubſtances which are reputed to be the Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies, except by the violence of the fire, which it ſclf divides not Bodies into perſectly ſimple or Elementary ſubſtances, but into new Compounds; Since, Iſay, theſe things are ſo, I ſee not why we muſt needs believe that there are any Primogeneal and ſimple Bodies, of which as of Pre- exſiſtent Elements Nature is oblied to compound all others. Nor do I ſe why we maynot conceive that ſhe may produce the Bodies accountcd mixt out of one another by Variouſly altering and contriving their minute parts, without reſolving the matter into any ſuch ſimple or Homogeneous ſubſtances as are pretended. Neither, to diſpatch, do I ſee why it ſhould be counted abſurd to think, that when a Body is reſolvd by the Fire into its ſupposd ſimple Ingredients, thoſe ſubſtances are not true and proper Elements, but rather were, as it were, Accidenily produd by the fire, which by Diſſipating a Body into minute Parts does, if thoſe parts be ſhut up in Cloſe Veſſels, for the moſt part neceſſarily bring them to Aſſociate Themſelves aſter another manner than before, and ſo bring Them into Bodies oſ ſuch Diiferent Conſiſtences as the Former Texiure of the Body, and Concurrent Circumſtances make ſuch disbanded particles apt to Conſtitute; as cxperience ſnews us Cand Ihave both noted it, and prov'd it already) that as there are ſome Concretes whoſe parts when diſſipated by fire are fitted to be put into ſuch Schemes of matter as we call Oyle, and Salt, and Spirit; So there are others, ſuch as are eſpecially the greateſt part of Minerals, whoſe Corpuſcles being of another Size or figure, or perhaps contrivd another Way, will not in the Fire yield Bodies of the like Conſiſtences, but rather others of differing Textures; Not to mention, that from Gold and ſome other Bodies, we ſee not that the Fire ſeparates any Diſtinct Subſtances at all; nor That even thoſe Similar Paris of Bodies hich the Chymiſts Obtain by the Fire, are the Elements whoſe names they bear, but Compound Bodies, upon which, for their reſemblance to them in conſiſtence, or ſome other obvious Quality, Chymiſts have been pleasd to beſtow ſuch Appellations. S32Raanna  aBRRaano 2693v:V&V&YEEò ſb;clq THE CONCLUSION. Heſe lat Words of Carneades being ſoon aſter folloWw'd bya noiſc which ſcemd to come from the place where the reſt of the Company was, he took it for a warning, that it was time for him to conclude or break off his Diſcourſe; and told his Friend3 By this time Ihope you ſce, Eleutherius, that if Helmonts Experiments be true, it is no abſurdity to queſtion whether that Doctrine be one, that doth not aſſert An Elements in the ſence before explaind. But becauſe that, as divers of my Arguments ſuppoſe the marvellous power of the Altahest in the Analyzing of Bodies, ſo the Effects aſcribdd to that dious, that though IT am not ſure but that there may be ſuch an Agent, yet little leſs than Zæetia ſeems requiſite to make a man ſure there is. And conſeuently I leave it to you to judge, how arre thoſe of my Arguments that are built upon Alcahestical Operations are weakned by that Liquors being Matchleſs; and ſhall therefore deſire you not to think that I propoſe this Paradox that re jects all Elements, as an Opinion cqually probable with the former part of my diſcourſe. For by that, Ihope, you are ſatisſied, that the Arguments wont to be brought by Chymiſts, to prove That all Bodies conſiſt oſ either Three Principles, or Five, are far from being ſo ſtrong as thoſe that Ihave employd to prs⸗c, that there is not any certain and Determinate number of ſuch Principles or Elements to be met with Univerſally in all mixt Bodies. AndI ſuppoſe I need not tell you, that theſe anti-Chymical Paradoxes might have been manag'd more to their Advantage; but that having not confind my Curioſity to Chymical Experiments, IWho am but a young Man, and younger Chymiſt, can yet be but ſlenderly furniſhed with them, in reference to ſo great and diſicult a Task as you impos'd upon me; Beſides that, to tell you the Truth, I durſt not employ ſome even of the beſt Experiments I am acquainted with, becatiſe I muſt not yet diſcloſe them; but however, I think I may preſume that whatI have hitherto Diſcourſed will induce you to think, that Chymiſts have been much more happy in finding Experiments than the Cauſes of them; or in aſigning the Principles by which they may beſt be explaind. And indeed when in the writings of Paracelſis I meet with ſuch Phantaſtick and Un-intelligible Diſcourſes as that Writer oſten puzzels and tyres his Reader with, fatherd upon ſuch excellent Experiments, as though he ſeldom clearly teaches, I oſten ſind he knew3 me thinks the Chymiſis, in their ſearches after truth, are not unlike the Navigators of Solomons Tarſbiſb Fleet, who brought home from their long and tedious Vovages, not only Gold, and Silver, and Ivory, but Apes and Peacocks too;3 For ſo the Writings oſ ſeveral (for I ſay not, all) of your Hermetick Philoſophets preſent us, together with divers Subſtantial and noble Expetiments, Theories, which either like Peacocks feathers make a great ſnew, but are neither ſolid nor uſeſul; or elſe like Apes, if they have ſome appearance of being rational, are blemiſ'd with ſome abſurdity or other, that when they are Alitentively conſiderd, makes them appear Ridiculous. Carneades having thus finiſh'd his Diſcourſe againſt the received Doctrines of the Elements 3 Eleutherius judging he ſhould not have time to ſay muchto him before their ſeparation, made ſome haſte to tell him; Iconfeſs, Carneades, that you have ſaid more in favour of your Paradoxes then I expected. For though divers of the Experiments you have mẽntiond are no ſecrets, and were not unknown to me, yet beſides that you have added many of your own unto them, you have laid them together in ſuch a way, and apply'd them to ſuch purpoſes, and made ſuch Deductions From them, as I have not Hitherto met with. But thoughIbe therefore inclind to think, that Philoponus, had he heard you, would ſcarce have been able in all points to defend the Chymical H;p0theſis againſt the arguments wherewith you have opposd it3 yet me thinks that however your Objections ſeem to evince a great part of what they pretend to, yet they evince it not all; and the numerous tryals of thoſe you call the vulgar Chymiſts, may be allowd to prove ſomething too. Wheherefore, ifit be granted you that you have made it probable, Firſt, that the differing ſubſtances into which mixt Bodies are wont to be reſolved by the Fire are not of a pure and an Elementary nature, eſpecially for this Reaſon, that they yet retain ſo much of the nature of the Concrete that afforded them, as to appear to be yet ſomewhat compounded, and oftentimes to differ in one Concrete from Principles of the ſame denomination in another: Next, that as to the number of theſe differing ſubſtances, neitheris it preciſely three, becauſe in moſt Vegetable and Animal bodies Earth and Phlegme are alſo to be found among their Ingredients 3 nor is there any one determinate number into which the Fire (as it is wont to be employd) does preciſely and univerſally reſolve all compound Bodies whatſoever, as well Minerals as others that are reputed perfectly mixt. Laſtly, that there are divers Qualities whichcannot wellbe referd to any of theſe Subſtances, as if they primarilyreſided in it and belongid to it;and ſome other qualities, which though they ſeem to have their chief and moſt ordinary reſidence in ſome one of theſe Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies, are not yet ſo deducible from it, but that alſo ſome more general Principles muſt be taken in to explicate them. If, Iſay, the Chymiſts (continues Elestherius) be ſo Liberall as to make you theſe three Conceſſions, I hope you will, on your part, be ſo civil and Equitable as to grant them theſe three other propoſiions namely 3 Firſt, that divers Mineral Bodies, and therefore probably all the reſt, may be reſolv'd into a Saline, a Sulphureons, and a Mercurial part; And that almoſt all Vegetable and Animal Concretes may, if not by the Fire alone, yet, by a shilfull Artiſt Employing the Fire a his chieſ Inſtrument, be divided into five differing Subſtances, Salt, Spirit, Oyle, Phlegme and Earth; of which the three former by realon oſ their being ſo much more Operative than the Two Later, deſerve to be Lookt upon as the Three active Principles, and by way of Eminence to be calVd the three principles of mixt bodies, Next, that theſe Principles, Though they be not perſectly Devoid of all Mixture, yet may without inconvenience be ſti'd the Elements of Compounded bodies, and bear the Names of thoſe Subſtances which they moſt Reſemble, and which are manifeſtly predominant in them; and that eſpecially for this reaſon, that none of theſe Elements is Diviſible by the Fire into Four or Five differing ſubſtances, like the Concrete whence it was ſcparated. Laſtly, That Divers of the Qualities of a mixt Body, and eſpecially the Medical Virtues, do for the moſt part lodge im ſome One or Other of its principles, and may Therefore uſeſully be ſought for in That Principle ſeverd from the others. And in this alſo (purſues Eleatheriis) methinks borh you and the Chymiſts may eaſily agree, that the ſureſt way is to Learn by particular Experiments, what differing paris particular Bodies do conſiſt of, and by what wayes ( either Actual or potential fire) they may beſt and moſt Conveniently be Separated, as without relying too much upon the Fire alone, for the reſolving of Bodies, ſo without fruitleſsly contending to force them into more Elements than Nature made Them up of, or ſtrip the ſeverd Principles ſo naked, as by making Them Exquiſitely Elementary to make them almoſt uſeleſs, Theſe things (ſubjoynes Elen.) I propoſe, without deſpairing to ſee them granted by you; not only becauſe Iknow that you fo much preferr the Repuration of Candor before that of ſubtility, that your having once ſupposd a truth would not hinder ſ trom imbracing it when clearly made out to you; bur becauſe, upon the preſent occaſion, it will be no diſparagement to you to recede from ſome of your Paradoxes, ſince the nature and occafion of your paſt Diſcourſe did not oblige you to declare your own opinions, but only to perſonate an Antagoniſt of the Chymiſis. So that (concludes he, with a ſmile) you may now by granting what I propoſe, add the Reputation of Loving tho trurh ſincerely to that of having been able to oppoſe it ſubtilly. Carneadess haſte forbidding him to anſwer this cralty piece of flattery; Till I ſhal(ſayes he) have an opportunity to acquaint you with my own Opinions abour the controverſies I have been diſcourſing of, you will nor, Ihope, expect I ſhould declare my own ſence of the Arguments I have employd. Wherefore I ſhall only tell you thus much at preſent; that though not only an acute Nauuraliſt, bur even I my ſelf could take plauſible Excentions at ſome of them; yet divers of them too are ſuch as will not perhaps be readily anſwer'd, and will Reduce my Adverſaries, at leaſt, to alter and Reform their Hypotheſis. I perceive I need nor minde you that the Objections I made againſt the Quaternary of Elements and Ternary of Principles needed not to be opposd ſo much againſt the Doctrines Themſelves (either oſ which, eſpecially the latter, may be much more probably maintain'd than hitherto it ems to have been, by thoſe Writers for it I have met with) as againſt the unaccurateneſs and the unconcludingneſs of the Analytical Experiments vulgarly Relyed On to Demonſtrate chem. And therefore, if cither of the two examin d Opinions, or any other Theory of Elements, ſhall upon rational and Experimental grounds be clearly made out to me;Tis Obliging, but not irrational, in you to Expect, that I ſhall not be ſo farr in Love with my Diſquieting Doubts, as not to be content to change them for undoubted truths. And (concludes Carneades ſmiling) it were no great diſpatagement for a Sceptick to confeſſe to you, that as unſatisſy'd as the paſt diſcourſe may have made you think me with the Doctrines of the Peripateticks, and the Chymiſts, about the Elements and Principles, I can yet ſo little diſcover what to acquiceſce in, that perchance the Enquiries of others have ſcarce been more unſatisfactory to me, than my own have been to my ſelſ. He Authors conſtant Abſence from the Preſſe, whilſt the former Treatiſe was Printing, and the Nature of the Subject ic rl. wherewith ordinary Compoſers are not wont to be at all acquainted, will,tis hop'd, procure the Readers Excuſe, till the next Edition, if the Errata be ſomewhat numerous, and if among them there want not ſome groſſer miſtakes, which yet are not the only Blemiſhes theſe lines muſt take notice of and acknowledg; For the Author now perceives that through the fault of thoſe to whom he had committed the former Treatiſe in looſe Sheets, ſome Papers that belonged to it, have altogether miſcarryed. And though it have luckily enough happen'd, for the moſt part, that the Omiſſion of them does not marr the Cohærence of the reſt; yettill the next deſign'd Edition afford an opportunity of inſerting them, it is thought fit that the Printer give notice of one Omiſſion at the End f the firſtDialogue; and that to theſe Er7ata there be annexd the enſuing ſheet of Paper, that was caſually loſt, or forgotten by him that ſhould have put it into the Preſſe; where it ought to have been inſerted, in the 187. printed Page, at the break, betwixt the words, ſNature] in the 131h. line, and ſBut] in the next line afſter. Though itis to be noted here, that by the miſtake of the Printer, in ſome Books, the number of 187 is placed at the top of two ſomewhat diſtant pages; and in ſuch copies the following addition ought to be inſerted in the latter of the two, as followeth. Andon this occaſion Icannot but take notice, that whereas the great Argument which the Chymiſts are wont to employ to vilify Earth and Water, and make them be look d upon as uſeleſs and unworthy to be recko'd among the Principles of Mixt Bodies, is, that they are not endowd with Specifick Properties, but only with Elementary qualities; of which they uſe to ſpeak very ſleightingly, as of qualities contemptible and unactive: I ſee no ſuſſicient Reaſon tor this Practice of the Chymiſts: For tis conſeſd that Heat is an Elementary Quality, and yet that an almoſt innumerable company of conſiderable Things are performd by Heat, is manifeſ to them that duly conſider the varous Phænomena wherein it intervenes as a principall Actor3 and none ought leſs o ignore or diſtruſt this Trurh then a Chymiſt. Since almoſt all the operations and Productions of his Art are performed chieſly by the means of Heat. And as for Cold it ſelf, upon whoſe account they ſo deſpiſe the Earth and Water, if they pleaſe to read in the Voyages of our Engliſn and Dutch Navigators in Nova Zembla and other Northern Regions what ſtupendious Things may be cftected by Cold, they would not perhaps think it ſo deſpicable. And not to repeat whatI lately recited to Youout of Paracelſus himſelf, who by the help of an intenſe Cold teaches to ſeparate the Quinteſſence of Wine; I will only now obſerve to You, that the Conſervation of the Texture of many Bodies both animate and inanimate do's ſo much depend upon the convenient motion both of their own Fluid and Looſer Parts, and of the ambient Bodies, whether Air, Water, &c. that not only in humane Bodies we ſee that the immoderate or unſeaſonable coldneſs of the Air (eſpecially when it finds ſuch Bodies overheaq ted) do very irequemtly diſcompoſe the Oewnomie of them, and occaſion variety of Diſeaſes; but in the ſolid and duràble Body of Iron it ſelf, in which oræ would not expect that ſuddain Cold ſnould produce any notable change, it may have ſo great an operation, that if you take a Wire, or other ſlender piece of ſteel, and having brought it in the fire to a white heat, You ſuffer it aſterwards to cool leaſurely in the Air, it will when it is cold be much of the ſame hardneſſe it was of before: Whereas if as ſoon as You remove it from the fire, you plunge it into cold water, it will upon the b den Refrigeration acquite a very much greater hardneſs then it had before;Nay, and will become maniſfeſtly brittle. And that you may not impute this to any peculiar Quality in the Water, or other Liquor, or Unctuous matter, wherein ſuch heated ſteel is wont to be quenched that it maybe temperd; Iknowa very skillful Tradeſman, that divers times hardens ſteel by luddenly cooling it in a Body that is neither a liquor, nor ſo much as moiſt. A tryal of that Nature I remember I have ſeen made. And however by the operation that Water has upon ſteel quenched in ir, whether upon the Account of its coldneſs and moiſture, or upon that of any other of its qualities, it appears, that water is not alwaies ſo ineſficacious and contemptible a Body, as our Chymiſts would have it paſſe for. And what Ihave ſaid of the Efficacy of Cold and Heat, might perhaps be eaſily enough carried further by other conſiderations and experiments; were it not that having been mention'd only upon the Bye, I muſt not inſiſt on it, bũt proceed to another Subject.
