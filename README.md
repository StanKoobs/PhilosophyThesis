I wrote this thesis for my BA in Philosophy of a Specific Discipline.
The title of the thesis is: "Modelling the history of early modern natural philosophy: the impact of Newtonâ€™s account of force British natural philosophy in the 17th and 18th century". 
All of this was done in R.
The most interesting file is the ngramAnalysis.R in which I create a network of words that are most associated with the word "force".
