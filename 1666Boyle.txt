IN this curious and inquiſitive Age, when men, altogether diſatisfied and wearied out ith the wranglings and idle ſpeculations oſ ihe Schools, are with equal æeal and induſtry ſo eqrneſt in their queſt and purſuit of a more ſolid, rational, and uſeful Philoſophy, it may prove a work very obliging and meritorious to help and guide thim in their ſtudies and reſearches, and to hang out a Light to them, (as the ægyptians uſed to do from their highly celebrated Pharos, for direction to the Mariners, that ſailed in thoſe dangerous Seas ner Alexandria,) whereby they may,with better ſucceſs, ſteer their courſe through the vaſt Ocean of Learning, and make more full and perſect Diſcoveries of hitherto un. kuon Phi loſophical verities: which has beęn the chief De ſign of this Gentleman of Honour, the moſt excellent and Incomparable Author in this Treatiſe now preſented to your view, wherein Principles are not (as was the mode and gnixęof former times) obtruded on the World npon the account of a Great Name, or involvid n cloudy and myſtical Notivns, which put ile Underſtauding upon the Wrack, and Jet when 3z vih vith all this labour and toile of the Brain thy are at laſt known, prove impertinent anãd uſeleſſe to the making out wiih ſatis faction, or ſo much as tolerably, the ordinary Phænomena, which Nature every day preſents the world vith, but ſuchas are built upon the ſirme and immoveable foundation of Reaſon, Senſe, and Experience, plain and obvious as ell to the Eye as the Onderstanding, and no leſs accurate and certain in their Application. And though the moſt noble Author hath herein, for the main, eſpouſed the Atomical Philoſophy (correcieà and purgea from the wild fancies and ex travagancies of the ſirſt Inventours of it, as to the Origine of the Univerſe, and ſtill imbraced with ſo much Rindneſs and tenderneſs by ſome Pretenders, againſt which He hath ſo Learnedly diſputed in his firſt part Of the Uſefulneſs of Experimental Philoſophy, . 74.5c.) in cxplicating the Appearances; yet conſidering the ſeveral Alterations and Additions (the happy product of his penetrating judgment) made theriin, I may not ſcruple to call it a New Hypotheſis, peculiar to the Author, made out by daily Obſervations, familiar Prooſs and Expiriments, and by exact and eaſily practicable Chymical proceſſes. whereby one of the moſt abſtruſet parts of Natural Philoſophy, rhæ Origine of - 3iii Forms Forms and Qualities, which ſo much vexd and puræled the Antients, ard which, Twou ld ſpiak with th: leave of the Carteſians, their Ingenious Maſter durſt ſcarce venture upon, cr at leaſt as unvilling to handle at large, is nw fully cleared, and become manifeſt: ſo that from this very Eſſay e may well take hope, and jiyfully cxpect to ſee the noble Project of the fumous VE RUL AM (hitherto reckond among the Deſiderata) receive its ſull and perfect Accmpliſbment, I mean, a real, uſeful, and experimental Phyſiology eſtabliſbed and bottomed upon eaſi-,tru?, and generally received Principles. But Iſhall not foreſtall thy judgment either about the Excell: ncy of th Author, or his Subject, who hath ſo frtely communicated to the Werld thoſe treaſures of Learning, wherewith his Minà is enriched, but ſvall ſoon refer you to the Work it ſelf, aſter I have given you theſe few Advertiſements. The following Diſcourſe (as is eaſily perceivar ble by divers Paſſages thereof) being written, ſeveral years ſince, whole and entire, as now it is, T knew not wh:ther it will be worth while to intimate, that the Author, caſually turning over of late a very recent Chymical Writer, found in one of his Treatiſes (divers of which he neven to this day read over) a part of the Fiſth Expe]a ment of the ſecond Section, but, as He profeſſes (and ſure is like to be believed, )he did not dream t hat That Chymiſt, or any other Author whatſocver had lighted on that part of the Experiment till a good while after he had made and examined That, among many others,concerning Salts, as may be eaſily gueſQd by the peculiar uſes and applications He mada of it. And though He had met with ſo unlikely an Experiment in a Writer, who, whether he deſtrve it or no, has the ill fortune to be much accuſta of Infincerity, and ſome of whoſe more caſie proceſſes our Author (ho yet is willing to ſpare his Name, and ſcems to think his works not uleleſs) could not find to ſucceed, He ſtould not have taken it upon his Authority, no more then be is mont to take other Proceſſes, divers of which He yet in the general ſuppoſes may be true npen the relation r other Chymiſts; who by blemiſbing their Books by things untrue and juſtly ſuſpicious, are not to be relyed on, nor much thanked by wary men. But twill pribably appear liſſe pertinint to adde any thing further on this ſubject, then to take notice, that when the Author had once conſented to the Publication of the ſollowing Papers, He ſeveral times wiſvd ſor an Opportunity to make the Experiments and Obſervations, He nov preſents to the Publick, li more more full and compleat, then they were when addreſs'd to a private Friend. But the Contagion, that drove him from the Places, where his Accommodations for repeating Experiments were, oblig?d Him to apply Himſelf to ot her Studies and Employments. And upon the ſame account, though he afterwards found many of his Notes upon other paris of the Eſiay of Sali- petre, and have lying by him divers Papers concerniug Senſible Qualities, and Senſation in general, and the Production oſSecond Qualities, rogether with a collection of Notes about Occult Qualities, and ſome ther Subjects of Rin to thoſe of this Books Jet having, upos the friſbly intimated Occaſion, diverted his Thoughts to other Subjects, He will not engage himſelf to put together and communicate his Collections on theſe Subjecis by any Publick premiſ. Onely thus much perchance I may undertakę ſur, if a fair Opportunity offer it ſelf, that the Autlir may be induc d to adae ere long, for the completion of ihis preſent Work, a Diſcourſe of Subordinate Forms, wherein He, not finding that they have been by any one attempted to be explieated by the Corpuſcularian Hypotheſis, hath propoſed an Acconnt of ihem agrecable thereunto. Furthirmore,as the Author has in the followa ing Diſquiſitions aimd not at the raiſing or abetting a Faction in Philoſophy, bat at the Diſcovery of the Truih; ſo he is not ſo ſollicitous what every ſort of Readir will ihink of his Aitempts, (which tis eaſie to foreſee are not like to be overmelcome to the Votaries of the School Philoſophy) a5 to reſuſe a Cempliance with the deſires of his Friends, who have been long ſince ver) earneſt with him not to ſpind that time in Replies to particular Perſons, which might be more uſefully imployd in pur ſuing ſurther Diſcoveries of Nature by Experiments. Iſ he m eet withany cogent and material Objecticns againſi any of his chief Opinions, He is enough a Lover of Truth, to be diſpoſd to think hin ſelf cbligd by thoſe that ſhall ſhew him his Miſtakes, and to take occaſion to reſorme them. But if nothing new or weighty be urg d, He conſiders, that he lives in an Age, wherein he has cbſervd (even in his Own caſe) that Truths, if reccmmended by rcal Experiments, will in ti me make their own way, and whercin live ſtore of Ingenious Men, who, for the main, approve the Opinions, and probably will not diſlike the Arguments he has propoſd, and who being more at leiſure then He rto write Polemical Books, will not ſilently ſuffer what they judge Truth, to be triumphd over,or oppreſsd by iheſe, who, imploying uſually but Scholaſtical Arguments, may be confuted by Anuſwers of the like nature. And th-refore He doubts not, but that ſome Learned Favourers of the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy (of which he hath endeavcur d to make out thoſe parts, wheriin they almest all agree) will be both able and willinꝗ to di fend thoſe Diſcoveries by rational Diſputations, that thiy have not Opportunity to increaſe by New Experiments. In the mean while I have uo Temptation to diubt in the leaſt, but that this curious and excellent Piece ill be entertained and received by all that have any regard to the great concerns of Learning with that guſt, delight, reſpect, and æſtimation which it ſo highly m.rits.  t b b ẽs The ſollowiag Treatiſe being vinted in the abſense of the Honourable Author, thre b s havned (through the miſplaciag of ibe ſeveral Buidles w it apart fairly for the Preſs) a Diſlocatioa at the 107. page, Cas is there alſo intimated) where the firſt Section of the Historical part is rlaced, which ſhould not have come in till p. 169. after the diſcourſe of F O RMS. The Promial Diſcourſe to the Reader. A tis the part oſa Mineraliſt both to 4iſcover new Mines, and to work thoſe that are already diſcovered, by ſeparating & melting the Oares, to reduce them into perfect Metals; ſo I eſteem, that it becomes a Naturaliſt, not onely to 4eviſe Hypothe ſes & Experiments, but to examine and /mprove thoſe that are already found out. Upon this conſideration (among other Motives) I was invited to make the following Attempt, whoſe productions coming to be expoſd to other Eyes, then thoſe for which they were firſt written, twill be requiſite to give the publick ſome Account ofthe Occaſion, the Scope, and ſome Circumſtances. And this Iſnhall do the more fully, becauſe the reaſons Iam to render of my way of writing in reference to the Peripatetick Philoſophy, muſt contain Intimations, which perbaps will not be uſeleſs to ſomè ſorts of Readers, (eſpecially Gentlemen,) and * The following Preface being addreſid onely to Pyrophilus, by being applyd to moſt of thoſe other parts of my Writings, that relate to the School Philoſophy, may do Them good ſervice, and ſave both my Readers aud me ſome trouble of Repetitions. Having four or five years ago publiſd a little Phyſico- Chymical Tract about the diſforing parts and redintegration of Nitre, I found as well by other ſignes as by the Early ſollicitations oſ the Stationer ſor a new Edition, that I had no cauſe to complain of the Reception that had been given it: But Tobſerved too, that the Diſcourſe, conſiſting chieſly oſ Reflexions, that were occaſionally made upon the Phænomena of a ſingle Experiment, was more available to confirme thoſe in the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy, that had already ſomewhat inquird into it, then to acquaint thoſe with the principles and notions of it, who were utter Strangers to it; and as to many Readers, was fitter to excite a Curioſity for that Philoſophy, then to give an Introduction thereunto. Upon this Occaſion it came into my mind, that about the time when I writ that Eſſay about Salt-petre, (which was divers years before twas publiſhed) Ihad alſo ſome thoughts of a Hiſtory of Qualities, and that having in looſe Sheets ſet down divers Obſervations and Experiments proper for ſuch a Deſign, IT had alſo drawn up a Diſcourſe, which was ſo contrivd, that though ſome parts of it were written in ſuch a manner, as that they may ſerve for Expoſitory Notes upon ſome particular paſſages of the Eſſay, vet thoſe parts with the reſt might ſerve for a Gereral Preface to the Hiſtory of Qualities, in caſe I ſhould ever have Conveniency as well as Inclination to make the proſecuting oſ It my Buſineſs, and in the mean time might preſent That Pyrophilus, to whom I writ, ſome kind of Introduction to the principles of the Mechanical Philoſophy, by expoundingto him, as far as my Thoughts and Experiments would enable nie to do, in few words, what, according to the Corpuſcularian Notions, may be thought oſthe Nature and Origine of Qualities and Forms, the knowledge of which either makes or ſuppoſes the moſt fundamental and uſeſul part of Natural Philoſophy. And to invite me to make uſe of theſe Conſiderations and Tryals about Qualities and Formes, it opportunely happend, that though I could not find many of the Notes written about particular Qualities, (my looſe papers having been, during the late Conſuſions, much ſcatter'd by the many Reroves I had then occaſion to make,) vet when laſt Winter, being urged to publiſn my Hiſtory of Gold, (which ſoon after came forth,) I rumagd among my Looſe papers, Ifound, that the ſeveral Notes of mine that he had met with under various heads, but yet all concerning the Origine of Forms and Qualities, together with the Preface addreſ'd to Pyrophilus, (though written at diſtant times and places) had two or three vears before, by the care ofan Induſtrious perſon, with whom ſ left them, been fairly copied out together, (which circumſtance I mention, that the Reader may not wonder to find the following Book not written uniformly in one continued tenor,) excepting ſome Experiments, which having been oſ my own making, twas not difficult for me to perfect, either out of my Notes and memory, or (where I doubted their ſufficiency) by repeated Tryals. So that ifthe Urgency, wherewith divers Ingenious Men preſsd the publication of my new Experiments about Gold, and my unvillingneſs to protract it, till the Froſty ſeaſon, that was ſitteſt to examine and provẽ them, were all paſ'd, had not prevaiſd with me to let thoſe Obſervations be made public the lat VVinter, they might hove been Accompanied with the preſent Eſſay oſ the Origine of Qualities and Formes, which may be premiſ'd to what 7 have written touching Any of the particular Qualities, ſince it containes Experiments and Conſiderations fit to be præliminary to them all. But though Iwas by this meancs diverted from putting onut the following Treatiſe at the ſame time with the Hiſtory of Gold, yet Iwas without much difficulty prevail'd with not to alter my intentions of ſuffering it to come abroad; becauſe divers of my Hiſtorical Accounts of ſome particular Qualities are to be reprinted, which may receive much Light and Confirmation by the things deliverd in this preſent Treatiſe abcut Qualities and Forms in general. To which Inducemeut was added the Perſwaſion of ſome ingenious Perſons, who are pleaſed to confeſſe their having receiv'd more Inlormation and Satisſaction in theſe Papers then I durſt pretend to give them: though indeed the Subject is ſo noble and important, and does ſo much want the being illuſtrated by ſome diſtinct and Experimental Diſcourſe, that nor enely if I did not ſuſpect my Friends of Partiality, I ſould hope that It may gratiſy many Readers, and inſtruct more then a few: but ſuchas it is I do not altogether diſpair, that it will prove neither unacceptable, nor uſeleſſe. And indeed the doctriues oſ Forms and Qualities, and Generation, and Corruptiun, and Alteration are wont to be treared of by Scholaſtical Philoſophers, in ſo obſcure, ſo perpiexd, and ſo unſatisfactory a way, and their Diſcourſes upon theſe Subjects do conſiſt ſo much more of Logical and Metaphyſical Notions and Niceties, then of Phyſical Obſervations and Reaſonings, that it is very dimcult for any Reader oſ but an ordinary Capacity, to underſtand what they mean, and no leſſe difficult for any intelligent and unprejudic d ReaUer to acquieſce in wnat they teach: which is oſtentimes ſo precarious, and ſo contradictious to its ſelf, that moſt Readers (without alwaies excepting ſuch as are Learned and Ingenious) frighted by the darkneſs and difficulties wherewith theſe Subjects have been ſurrounded, do not ſo much as look after or read over theſe general and controverted matters, about which the Schools make ſo much noiſe; but deſpairing to find any ſatiſfaction in the ſtudy oſ them, betake Themſelves immediately to that part oſ Phyſicks that treats oſ particular Bodies: ſo that to Theſe it will not be unacceptable to have any intelligible Notions offer'd them of thoſc Things, which, as they are wont to be propoſd, are not vont to be underſtood: though yet the Subjects themſelves, if I miſtake nor, may be juſtly reckon'd not onely amongſt the nobleſt and moſt impo: tant, but (in cale they be duely propoſd,) among the uſefulleſt and moſt delightſul Speculations, that belong to Phyſicks. I conſider too, that among thoſe that are inclid to that Philolophy, which, I find, I have been much imitated in calling Corpuſcularian, there are many Ingenious Perſons, e ſpecially among the Nobility and Gentry, who, having been firſt drawn to like this new way of Philoſophy, by the ſight of ſome Experiments, which for their Novelty or Pret. tineſs they were much pleaſd with, or for their Strangeneſs they admird, have aſterwards delighted Them ſelves to make, or ſee variety of Experiments, without having ever had the Opportunity to be inſtructed in the Rudiments or fundamental Notions of that Philoſophy, whoſe ꝑleaſing or amazing Productions have enamourd them ofIt. And as Qur Pyrophilus, for whom theſe Notes were drawn up, did in ſome regards belong to this ſort of Virtuoſi, ſo tis not impoſſitle, but that ſuch Readers, as He was then, will not be ſorry to meet with a Treatiſe, wherein though my chief and proper buſineſſe be the giving ſome Account of the Nature and Origine of Forms and Qualities; yet by reaſon oſ the connexion and dependance berwixt theſe and divers oſthe other principal Things, that belong to the general part of Phyſicks, I have been obligd to touch upon ſo many other important Points, that this Tract may, in ſome ſort, exhibit a Scheme of, or ſerve for an Iutroduction into the Elements of the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy. And as thoſe Readers, that have hãad the Curioſity to peruſe what is commonly taught in the Schools about Forms, and Generation, and Corruption, and thoſe other things we have been mentioning, and have (as is uſual among ingenious Readers) quitted the ſtudy of thoſe unſatisfactory intricacies with Diſguſt, will not be diſgleaſd to find in our Notes ſuch Explications of thoſe things as render them at leaſt intelligible: ſo it will not perhaps prove unacceptable to ſuch Readers, to find thoſe matters, which the Schools had interwoven with Ariſtotles Doctrine, recon cid and accommodated to the Notions of the Corpuſcular Phyſicks. 1If it be ſaid, that Ihave leſt divers thing⸗ unmentiond, which are wont to be largely treated of by the Ariſtotelians, and particularly have omitted the Diſcuſiion of ſeveral Queſtions, about which they are wont very ſolemnly and eagerly to contend, I readily acknowledge ſ to be true: But Ianſwer further, That to do otherwiſe then I have done, were not agreeable to the nature of my Deſign, as is declard in the Preface to Pyrophilus, and that though moſt Readers will not take notice of it, yet ſuch as are converſant in that ſort of Authors, will, IT preſume, eaſily find, that Ihave not left them unconſulted, but have had the Curioſity to reſort to ſeveral both ofthe more, and of the leſſe recent Scholaſtical Writers about Phyſicks, and to ſome of the beit Metaphyſicians to boot, that Imight the better inform my ſelf, both what their Opinions are, and upon what arguments they are grounded. But as I found thoſe inquiries far more troubleſome then uſeful, ſo Idoubt not, that my omiſſions will not much diſpleaſe that ſort of Readers, for whoſe ſakæ chiefly tis that theſe Papers are permitted to be made publick. For if  ſhould increaſe the Obſcurity of the Things themſelves Itreat oſ, by adding the ſeveral Obſcub rer Comments (rather then Explications,) and the perplex'd and contradictious Opinions I have met with among Scholaſtick Writers; ] doubt that ſuch perſons, as I chiefly write for, would inſtead oſ better comprehending what l ſhould ſo deliver, abſolutely forbear to read it. And there being many Doctrines, to which number This we are ſpeaking of ſeems to belong, wherein the ſame innate Light, or other Arguments, that diſcover the Truth, do likewiſe ſufficiently ſhew the Erroneouſneſs oſ diſſlenting Opinions, I hope it may ſuffice to propoſe and eſtabliſh the Notions that are to be imbrac'd, without ſollicitouſly diſproving what cannot be true, iſ thoſe be ſo. And indeed there are many Opinions and Arguments of good repute in the Schools, which do ſo entirely rely upon the Authority of Ariſtotle, or ſome of his more celebrated Followers, that where that Authority is not acknowledg d, to fall upon a ſolemn Confutation o what has been ſo precariouſly advanc'd, were not onely unneceſſary, but indiſcreet even in a Diſcourſe not confind to the brevity challeng:d by the nature ofthis of Qurs. And there are very many Queſtions and Gontroverſies, which about, and indeed pertinent and fit enough to be debated in their Philoſophy, do vet ſo much ſuppoſe the Truth of ſeveral of their Tenents, which the new Philoſophers reject, or are grounded upon Technical Terms or forms oſ ſpeaking, that ſuppoſe the Truth of ſuch Opinions, or are Expreſſions, whereoſ we neither do, nor need make any uſe: that to have inſerted ſuch Debates into ſucha Diſcourſe as mine, would have been not onely tedious, but impertinent. Asſ for inſtance) thoſe grand Diſputes, whether the four Elements are endowd with diſtinct Subſtantial Forms, or have onely their proper Qualities inſtead of them? and whether they remain in mix'd Bodies according to their Forms, or according to their Qualities? and whether the former or the latter of thoſe be, or bæ not refracted? Theſe, I ſay, and divers other controverſies about the fo.ur Elements, and their manner of Miſtion, are quite out of doors in their Philosophy, that acknowledge neithe, that there are four Elements, nor that Cold, Heat, Dryneſſe, and Moiſture, are in the Deripatetick ſenſe, firſt Qualities, or that there are any ſuch Things as Subſtantial Forms i⸗ rerum naturã. And it made me the more unwilling to ſtuff theſe Papers with any needleſs School- controverſies, becauſe I found, upon peruſal of ſeveral Scholaſtick Writers, (eſpecially the recenter, who may probably be ſuppoſd to be the moſt refind,) that they do not alwaies mean the ſame Things by the ſame Terms, but ſome imploy them in one ſenſe, others in another, and ſom etimes the Jame Writer uſes them in very differing ſenſes; which Iam obligd to take notice oſ, that ſuch Readers, as have conſuited ſome oſthoſe Authors, may not accuſe me of miſtaking or injuring ſome of the õcholaſtical Terms and Notions he may meet with in theſe Papers, when I have encly imployd Them in the ſenſe of orher School- writers, whichI judgd preferrible And this puts me in mind of intimating, That whereas, on the contrary, I ſometimes imploy variety of Terms and Phra. ſes to expreſs the ſame Thing, I did it purpoſely, though perhaps to the prejudice of my own Reputation, for the Advantage of Pyrophilu:; both I and others having obſerved, that the ſame unobvious Notions being ſeveral waves expreſſd, ſome Readers even among the Ingeniouſer ſort of them, will take it up much. better in one of thoſe Expreſſions, and ſome in another. llll But perhaps it will be wondred at, su3 hy — . The Author to the Reader. ſome oſthe new Philoſophers, That diſſenting ſo much as I do from Ariſtutle and the Schoolmen, I ſnould overlook or decline ſome Arguments, which ſome very ingenious Men think to be oſ great force againſt the Doctrine l oppoſe. But divers of theſe Arguments being ſuch, as the Logicans call ad honminem, ] thought I might well enough ſpare them. Tor l have obſerv'd Ariſtotle in his Phyſicks to write very often in ſo dark and ambiguous a way, that tis far more difficult, then one would think, to be ſure what his Opinion was: and the Unlearned, and too frequently jarring Gloſſes of his Interpreters, have oſten made the Comment darker then the Text: Io that ſthough in moſt it Be,vet) in divers caſes tis not eaſie (eſpecially without the expence of many words) to lay open the Contradictions of the Peripatetick Doctrine; beſides, that the urging ſuch contradictions are oftentimes fitter to ſilence an unwary Adverſary, then ſatisfie a wary ard judicious Reader. It being very poſſible, that a man may contradict himſelſ in two ſeveral places of his Works, and yet not be in both of Them in the wrong. For one oſ his Aſſertions, though inconſiſtent with the other, may yet be conſiſtent with Truth. But this 35 not all I have to ſay on this Occaſion. For bæſides, that having, for many reaſons, elſewhere mentiond, purpoſely forborn the reading of ſome very much, and, for ought I know, very juſtly Eſteemd Diſcourſes about general Hypotheſes, tis very poſſible, that may be a ſtranger to ſome of thoſe Arguments: beſides this, I ſay, Iconſeſs I have purpoſely forborn to make uſe oſ others, which ] have ſufficiently taken notice of. For ſome of thoſe Ratiocinations would eng: ge him thãt ſhould imploy them, to adopt an Hypo1heſis or Theory, in which perbaps I am not ſo throughly ſatisfied and of which 7 do not conceive my ſelf to have, on this occaſion, any neceſſity to make uſe: and accordingly 7 have forborn to imploy Arguments, that are either grounded on,  ſuppoſe Indiviſſble Corpuſcles, calld Aroms, or any innate metion belonging to them; or that the Eſſence of Bodies conſiſts in Extenſion, o that a Vacuum is impoſſible; or that there are ſuch Glcbuli cæleſtes,  iuch a Materia ſubiilis, as the Carteſians imploy to explicate moſt of the Phænomena of Nature. For theſe, and divers other Notions, I ſwho here write rather for the Corpuſcularians in general, then any party of them) thought it improper needleſly The Author to the Reader. to take in, diſcourſing, either againſt thoſe, tu whom theſe things appear as diſputable, as the Peripatetick Tenents ſeem to me; or for to ſatisſie an Ingenious perſon, whom it were not ſair to impoſe upon with Norions, thatI did not my ſelſ think proper. NAnd on the like Account I forbore ſuch Arguments as thoſe, that ſuppoſe, in Nature and Bodies inanimate, Teſigns, and Paſſions proper to Living, and perhaps peculiar to Intelligent Beings: and (ſuch as) ſome Prooſũ that are drawn ſfrom the Theology of the chools: (which I wiſh leſſe interwoven with Ariſtotles Philoſophy.) For though there bæ ſome things, which ſeem to be oſ this ſort, (as Arguments drawn from final cauſes in divers particulars that concern Animals,) which, in a ſound ſenſe ĩ not onely Admit, but Maintain: yet ſince, as they are wont to be propoſd, they are liable enough to bæ queſtiond, Ithought it expedient for my preſent deſign to prætermit them, as things that l do not abſolutely need; thovgh the imploying ſfome of Them would facilitate my Task. And this I did the rather, becauſe lalſo forbæar to anſæer Arguments, that however vehe mentIy and ſubtly urg'd by miny of the modern nion, are either conſeſſedly, or at leaſt really built upon ſome Theological Tenents oſ theirs, which, being oppoſd by the Divines of Other Churches, and not leſt unqueſtion d by ſome Acute ones oſ their Own, would not be proper to be ſolemnly taken notice of by Me, whoſe Buſineſs, in this Traẽt, is to diſcourſe of Natural Things as a Naturaliſt, without invading the Province oſ Divines, by intermedling with Supernatural Myſteries, ſuch as thoſe, upon which divers of the Phyſico- Theological Tenents of the Schoolmen, eſpecially about real Qualities, and* the Separableneſs of Accidents from Subjects of Inhæſion, are maniſiſtly, iſ not alſo avowealy, grounded. But to return to the other things I was owning to have leſt unmention'd; notwithſtanding all that I have been ſaying, l readily acknow-  Atque hæc ſentenlia (of the Diſtinction and Separableneſs of Quantity from Matter) eſit omnino tencnda: quanquam aim non peſſit, ratione naturali ſuſſicienter deinonſirari, tamen ex piincipiis Thtologiæ tonvincitus cſſe vera,maximè propter myſterium Encharistiæ: Suarez diſp.

And my forbearing to proſecute ſome of the Peripatetick Controverſies any further then I have done, will not, hope, be blamd by Them, that have obſervd as well as I, how much thoſe Diſputes are wont to be lengthned by ſuch frivolous Diſtinætions, as do not deſerve to be ſolemnly examind, eſpecially in ſuch a Compendious Treatiſe as Ours. For an attentive Reader needs not be much converſant with the writings of the modern Peripateticks, about ſuch ſubjects as Subſtantial Forms, Generation, Corruption, &c. to take notice, that tis their Cuſtome, when they find Themſelves diſtreſsd by a ſolid Argument, it, and particularly to take notice, that That on:. Diitinction of atu & potentia runs th vughalmoitall Ariſtotle's Philo ſophy, and is imployd to ſift off thoſe Diſficulties he could not clearly Explicate. E By which nevertheleſs  would not be underſtood u cenſure or decry the whole Peripatetick Philoſophy, much leſſe to deſpiſe Ariſtotle himſelt; whoſe own Writings give me ſometimes cauſe a little to wonder, to find ſome Abſurdities ſo confidently ſather'd upon him by his Scholaſtick Interpreters. Lor I look upon Ariſtotle as ene though but as one amongſt many) of thoſe famd Antients, whoſe Learning about Alexanders time enobled Greece; and I readily allow him moſt of the prayſes due to great Wits, excepting thoſe which belong to cſear- headed Naturaliſis. And I here declare, once for all, that where in the following Tract, or any other of my writings, I do ind:ſinitely depreciate Ariſtoile's Doctrine, I wouid be underſtood to ſpeak of his Phyſicks, or rather oſ the Speculative part oſthem, (tor his Hiſtorical VVritings concerning Animals I much eſteem,) nor do I ſay, that even Theſe may not have their Uſe amonꝶ Scholers, and even in Univerſities, if they be retain d and ſtudied with due cautilE ons and Limitations; (of which I have elſewhere ſpoken.) But to reſume the Diſcourſe, whence the Peripatetick Diſtinctions tempted me to digreſs; by any iling formerly ſaid, I would not in the leaſt diſparage thoſe excellent and eſpecially thoſe modern Authers, that have proleſſedly oppoſed the Ariſtotelian Phyſicks: ſuch as Lucretius, Verulam, Bæſſo, Des Cartes and his Tollowers, Gaſſendus, the two Boots, Magrenus, Ptmble, Helmont, Jnor be thought to have made no uſe of any of their Cogitations or Arguments. For though ſome oſ their Books I could not procure, when ĩi had occa. ſion to have recourſe to Them: and though the weakneſ/ of my Eyes diſcouragd me from peruſing thoſe paris of others, that concernd not the Subject I was treating of, yet Ihope I have been beneſitted by thoſe i have conſulted, and might have been more ſo, by the LearnedGaſſenduss Little, but Ingenious, Syntagma Philoſophiæ Lpicæri, it I had more ſeaſonably been acquainted with it. But whet her we have treated oſ the Nature and Origine of Forms and Qualities in a more comprehenſive way then others, whether we have by new and fit Similitudes, and Examples, ligible then they have done, whether we have added any conſiderable number of Notions and Arguments, towards the compleating and confirming of thæ propoſd Hypotheſis, whether we have with realon diſmiſsd Arguments unfit to be relyd on, and wh ther we have propoſd ſome Notions and Arguments ſo warily, as to keep Them from being lyable to Exceptions or Evaſions, whereto they were obnoxious as otheis have propoſd them, whether (Iſay) we have done all or any of theſe in the firſt or Speculative part of this Treatiſe, we willingly leave the Reader to judge: But in the ſecord or Hiſtorical part of it, perhaps he will be invited to grant, that we have done that part oſ Phyſicks, we have been treating of, ſome little ſervice: ſince by the Lovers oſ real Learning, it was very much wiſh'd, that the Doctrines of the new Philoſophy (as tis calld) were back d by particular Experiments. the want of whichI have endeavour'd to ſupply, by annexing ſome, whoſe Nature and Novelty Iam made be. lieve will render them as well Acceptable as inſtructive. For though, that I might not anticipate what belongs to other papers, I did not make the Laſt Seclion conſiſt of above a Decad oſ them; and though, for the reaſons intimated in the Advertiſements premiſd to them, Idid not expreſly mention to Pyrophilus all that Icould have told him about them, vet Ihave been careſull ſo to chooſe them, and to interweave Hints in delivering them, that a ſagacious Reader, who ſhall have the Curioſity to try them heedfully, and make Reflexions on the ſeveral Phænimena, that in likelihood will occurr to him, will(ii I miſtake not) receive no contemptible information, as of ſome other things, ſo particularly abont the nature of Mixtions, (which Itake to he one oſ the moſt important and uſeful, though neglected and ill underſtood, Doctrines of the Practical part of Phyſicks) and may probably Jight upon more then he Expects, or 1 have fully Delivered, and perhaps too more then I Foreſaw. And though ſome Virtuoſi, more converſant perhaps with Things then Books, preſuming the Decay of the Peripatetick Philoſophy to be every where as great, as tis among Them in England, may think that a Doctrine, which they look on æs Expiring, need not have been ſo ſollicitouſly conſuted: yet thoſe that know, how deeꝑ rooting this Philoſophy has taken (both elſewhere, and particularly) in thoſe Academies, where it has flouriſnd for many Ages, and in ſomẽ of which tis, excluſively to the Mechanical Phis loſophy, water'd and fenced by their Statutes or their Superiours: and he that alſo knows, how much more eaſie ſome (more ſubtle, then Candid) Wits, find it plauſibly to defend an Error, then ingeniouſly to confeſs it; will not wonder, that I ſhould think, that a Doctrine ſo advantagd, though it be too erroneous to be Fear'd, is yet too conſiderable to be Deſpiſdc And not to queſtion, whether ſeveral ofthoſe, that moſt contemn the favourers of the Peripatetick Hypctheſis, as the later Diſcoveries have reducd them to Reform it, be not the leaſt provided to anſwer their Arguments: (not to queſtion this, I ſay,) there are divers of our Adverſaries (miſled orely by Education, and morally harmleſs prejudices) who do ſo much Deſerve a better Cauſe, then that which Needs all their ſubtlety without being VVorthy of it, that I ſhall think more paines, then Ihave taken, very uſeſully beſtow d, if my Arguments and Experiments prove ſo happy, as to undeceive Perſons, whoſe parts, too unluckily confin d to Narrow and Fruitleſs Notions, would render them illuſtrious Champions for the Truths they are able ſo Subtlely to oppoſe; and who fnight queſtionleſs perform Conſiderable things, iſ they imployd as much Dexterity to Expound the Myſteries of Nature, as the Riddles of the School. men. and laid out their VVit and Induſtry to ſurmount the Obſcurity oſ Her works in ſtead of that of Ariſotles : ] v There might be a ſew other particulars ſit tò be taken notice of in this Preface, but finding that I had already mention'd them in that, which Ihad addreſs d to Pyrophilus, my Haſt makes me willing rather to refer the Reader thither for them, then Alter that, or Lengthen this; (which I ſhould think much too Long already, ifit were not poſſible that it may hereaſter prove Præliminary to more papers then theſe tis now premiſd to.; So that there remaines but one Advertiſement neceſſary to be given here, namely, that whereas in the following Notes I ſeveral times ſpeak oſ the Author of the Eſſay of Saltpetre, as of a third perſon, the Occaſion of that was, That when theſe Notes, and ſome about particular Qualities, were written, I had a Deſign to make two diſtinct ſorts of Annotations upon that Eſſay; in the ſormer whereof (which now comes forth) Iaſſumed the perſon ofa Corpulcularian, and diſcourſt that rate: But I had thoughts too ũin cãſe God were pleaſtd to grant me Life and Opportunity,) to take a ſecond Review both of the Treatiſe it ſelſ, and oſthe Notes on it, and on that occaſion to Adde what my riper Thoughts and ſurther Ex perience might ſuggeſt unto me. And that in my Animadverſions I might, with the. more Freedome: and Conveniency, Adde, Explain, Alter, and even Retract, as Iſnould ſee cauſe, I thought it not amiſs to write them, as if they were made on the VVork of anotherr. By which Inti⸗ mation the Reader may be aſſiſted to gheſs how much I intended in the following Diſrourſe, ſin which, as in the Prefaces belonging to it, Iplay the Corpuſcularian,) to re. ſerve my ſelf the Freedom oſ Queſtioning, and Correcting, upon the deſign'd Review, any thing deliver'd in theſe Notes; and how much more it wa: in them my deſign to bring-Pjrophilus Experiments and Qu. ries to Illuſirate obſcure matters, then, by haſty Aſſertions, to Dogmatize about. themm. The Præface. ſœræ5"m He origine (Pyrophilus) and 49 Vætò Nature of the Qualities of Bo5 Voò dies, is a Subject, that 1 have long lookt upon, as one of the moſt Important and Uſefull that the Naturaliſt can pitch upon for his Contemplation. For the Enovledge e have of the Bodies without Us, being for the Moſt part fetched from the informations the Mind receives by the Senſes, e ſcarce now any thing elſe inBodies, upon whoſe account they can worke upon onr Senſes ſave their Qualities: For asto the Subſtantial Formes, which ſome Imagine to be in allNaturall Bodies, it is not halfe ſo Evident, that there are ſuch,as it is, that the iſeſt of thoſe rhat doudmit them, Confeſſe, that ihey do not mell Know them. And as tis by their Quaities, that Bodies act Immediately upon our ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Nego tibi ullam eſſe formam nobis notam plenẽ & planẽ: roſrãmque ſcientiam eſſe.umbram in ſole. Scaliger: (of 7hoſe confeſſion to the ſame puipoſe, more are cited hereafier.) Senſes, ſotis by vertue of thoſe Attributes litewiſe,that they act upon other bodies, & by that action produceinThem, & oftentimes inThem ſelves thoſe Changes, that ſometimes we call Alterations, and ſometimes Generation, or Corruption. And tis chiefly by the Xnovledge, ſuch as it is, that Experience, ( not Art) hath taught Us, of theſe differing Qualuties of Bodies, that we are enabled, by a due application of Agents to Patients, to exerciſe the littleEmpire, that e have either Acquird or Regaind over the Creatures. But I think not the contemplation of Qualities more Noble & Uſeful,then Ifind it Difficult; For what is ont to be taught us of Qualities inthe Schools, is ſo Slight and ill grounded, that it may be doubted, hether they have not rather Obſcurea, then Illuſtrated ihe things they ſhould have explaimd. And I was quickly diſcouraged from expecting to learne much from them, of the Nature of diners Particular Qualities, hen I found, that except ſome few, which they tell Tou in General may be deduced, (by wayes they leave thoſe to gueſſe at that can,) from thoſe foure Qualities, they are pleasd to call the Firſt; 1hey confeſſe,that the reſt ſvring from thoſe Forms of Bodies, hoſe particular Natures, the judiciouſeſt of them acknowledge, they cannot comprehend. And Ariſtotle himſelf not only doth as we ſhall ſee anon) give us of Qualitie in Generall, &hich yet ſecins far more eaſily deſineable, then many a Particular Quality, ) no other then ſuch æ definition,as is as Obſcure, as the thing to be declared by it; but I Obſerve not without ſome wonder, that in his eight Books of Phyſicks, where he profeſedly treats of the Generall A ffections of Naturall things, he leaves out the Doctrine of Qualities; as after him Magirus, and divers other Writers of ihe Peripatetick Phyſiologie have done : which (by the way) I cannot but look upon as an Omiſion, ſince Qualitics doe as well ſeem to belong to Naturall Bodies Generally conſiderd, as Place, Time, Motion, and thoſe other things, which upon that account are wont to be Treated of in the Generall part of Natural Philsſophy. The moſt Iugenious Des Cartes has ſomething concerning ſome Qualities; but though for Reaſons elſehere expreſsãd, I have purpoſelyForbornto peruſe hisSyſteme of Philoſorhy,yet I find by Turning over the Leaves that he has Left moſt of the other Qualities Untreated of,&of Thoſe, that are more properly call'd Senſible, he Speaks but very Briefly& Generally;rather conſiaering what they do upon the Organs of Senſe,then what Changes happen in the objecis themſel ves, to make them Cauſe in us a Perception ſometimes of one Quality, and ſometimes of Another. Beſides, ihat his Explications, do many of them ſo depend upon His peculiar Notions, (of a Materia Subtilis, Globuli Secundi Elementi, and the like) and Theſe, as it became ſo Great a Perſon, he has ſo Intermoven vith the reſt of his Hypotheſis, that They can ſeldome be made Uſe of, without Adopting his whole Philoſophy. Epicurus indeeà, and his Scholiæſt Lucreli tius, have Given ſome good Hints concerning the Nature of ſome fev Qualities. But beſide, that even theſe Explications are divers of them either Doubtfull or imperfect,or both, there are many other Qualities, which are lefi for Others to Treat of. And this is the Second and Maine Difficul1y, which I find in inveſtigating the Nature of Qualities, Namely, that Whatever be to be thought of the Generall Theoryes of Ariſtotle, or other Philoſophers, concerning Qualities, we evidently Want That, npon which a Theory,to be Solid and ſefull, muſt be Built; I mean an Experimentall Hiſtory of them. And this we ſo Want, that except perhaps what Mathematicians have done concerning Sounds, and the Obſervations (rather then Experiments) that our Illu ſtrious Verulam hathſin ſome few Pages) ſayd of Heat, in his ſlort Eſſay, De Formã Calidi; I know not Any one Quality, of which any Author has yet Giuen us an any thing competent Hiſtory. Theſe things I mention to You, Pyrophilus, nos at all 10 derogate ſrom thoſe Great Men ; whoſe deſiun ſeems rather to have been to deliver Principles and Summaries of Philoſophy, then to inſiſt upon Particulars; but for this purpoſe, that ſince the Nature of Qualities is ſo beneſiciall a ſpeculation, my labours may not he lood upon as wholly Uſeleſſe, though Ican contribute but a litile to the clearing of it: and that ſince 'tis ſo abſtruſe a ſubject, Imay be pardonã, if I ſometimes miſe the marke, and leave diverſe things uncompleatea, T hat being but what ſuch great Philoſophers have done before mee. But, Pyrophylus, before I proceed to give Tou my Notes upon this part of our Authors Eſſay, that you may rightly underſtand my Intention in them,it will be requiſite to give y0 three or foure Advertiſements. And ſirſt, when ever Iſhall ſpeate indefinitely of subſtantiall forms, 1 ould almayes be under ſtood to except the Reaſonable Soule,that is ſaid to inform the humane Body; which Declaration I here deſire may be The Preface. taken notice of, once for all. Secondly, Nor am Ivilling to treat of ihe origine of Qualities in beaſts; partly becauſc 1 would not be engaged to examine, of vhat Nature their Soules are,and partly betanſe it is difficult in moſt caſes, (at lcaſt for one, that is compaſſionate enough,) either to mate experiments upon Living animais, or to judg what influence their Life may have,upon the change of Qualities, produc d by ſuch Experiments. Thirdly, The occaſion of the following Reflections, being onely this;that our Author in tha part of his Eſſay concerning Salipeter, whereto theſe Notes referre, does briefly Intimate ſome Notions about the Natur: and Origine of Qualities; Tou muſt mt exſpect, that 1, hoſe Method leads me but to Write ſome Notes upon this, anl ſome other parts of this Eſſay, ſhould nake Solemne or Elaborate diſcourſes concrning the Nature of particular Rualitis, and that I ſuld fullydeliver m)y own apprehenſions concerning thoſe Subjects. For as I elſemhere ſufficiently Intimate, that in theſe fir ſt Notes IWrite a Corpuſcularian, & ſet down thoſe Thing: onely, that ſeem to have a tendency to Illuſtrate or Countenance the Notions or Fancies implyd in our Authors Eſſay: So I muſt here Tell you, that Inucither have now the Leaſure, nor Pretend to the Still, te deliver Fully the Hiſtory, or toExplicate ?articularly the Nature of Each ſeveral Quality. Fourthly, But Iconſider, that theschools have of late much Amusd the worla, with àa way they have got, of Iteferring all Naturall Effects tocertain Entities,that ileycall Reall Qualities, and accordingly Attribute tothem a Nature diſtinci from ihe Modification of the Matter they belong o,& in ſome caſes Separable from all Matto whatſotver, by which Meanes they have, is farre forth as their Doctrine is Acquiedd in, made it thought Needleſſe or Hopeleſs for men to Employ their Induſtry, in ſarching into the Nature of Particular Qu.lities, & their Effects. As if,for inſtanceit be Demandeã, manded, how Snow comes todaxle the Ejes, they will anſer, that tis by a Quulity of Whiteneſ that is in It; hich majes all very white Bodies produce the lame Effect; And if You, ask what this Whiteneſs is, They will teil you no more in ſubſtance, then that iis a re ll Entity, which denominates ihe Parcel o Matter,to which it is Foynd, hite,& if ou further Enquire, what ihis real Entity, which They call a Quality, is, Tou will ſinã, aswee ſtall ſee anon, that They either Speak of it much after the ſame rate, that They do of theirSubſtantiall Forms;as indecd ſome of the Modern ſt teach, That a Quality affects the Matter it belongs to, per modum formæ ſecundariæ, as they ſpea or at leaſi ihey ill not E xplicate it morelntelligibly. And accordingly if you further ask them, howwhite Bodies in Generall do rather Producethis effect of dazling the Eyes, then Green or Blew ones, inſtead of being told, that the former ſort of Bodies reflect Ooutarãs, and ſoto the Eye farre more of the Incident Light, then the Latter; Tou ſhall perchance be told, that 'tis their reſpective Natures ſo to act, by which way of diſpãtching difficulties, they mate it very eaſy to ſolve All the Phonomena of Nature in Generai, but make men think it impoſſible to explicate almoſt Any of them in Particular. And though the Unſatisfactoriſneſ and Barrenneſſe of the School- Philoſophy have perſwaded a great many Learned Men, eſpecially Phyſicians, to ſubſtitute the Chymiſts Three principles, inſtead of thoſe of 1he Schools; and though I have a very good opinion of Chymiſtryit ſelf, astis a Practicall Art; yet astis by Chymiſis pretended to containe a Syſteme of Theoricall Priuciples of Philoſophy, Ifear it will afford but very litile ſatisfaction toa ſevere enquirer, into the Nature of Qualities. For beſides that, as we ſall more particularly ſee anon, there are Many Qualities, which cannot with any probability be deduc'd from Anjyof the three Principles; thoſe that are aſcrib'd to one, or other ted, ithout recourſe to the more Comprehenſive Principles of the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy. Totell us, fer inſtance, that all Solidity proceeds from Salt, onely informing us, here ii can plauſibly be pretended) in what materiall principle or ingredient rhat Quality re ſides, not how it is produced; for this doth not teach us, for example) how Water even in exactly closd veſels comes to be froxen into Ice; that is, turnd from a fluid to a Solid Body, without the acceſſion of a ſaline ineredient (which Ihave not yet found pretended, eſpecially Glaſſe being held 1mpervious to Salts.) Wherefore, Pyrophilus, Ithought it might much conduce to the underſtanding the Nature of Qualities, To ſhiew how they are Generated; and by ihe ſame way, I hop d it might remove in ſome meaſure the obſtacle, that theſe Dark and Narrow Theories of the Peripatetichs and Chymiſts may prove to the Advancement of ſolid and uſefull Philoſophy. That then, which Ichieſlyr ime at, is to make it Probabie to you by Experiments, (which I Think hath not yet beene done:) That allmoſt all ſorts of Qualities, moſt of which have been by the Schooles either left Unexplicated, or Generally referrd, to I know not what Incomprehenſible Subſtantiall Formes; may be produced Mechanically, I mean by ſuch Corporeall Agents, as do not appear, cither to Work otherwiſe, then by vertue of the Motion, Sixe, Figure, and Contrivance of their ovn Parts, hich Atiributes I call the Mechanicall Affections of Matter,hecauſe to Them men villingly Referre the various operations of Mechanical Engines:) or to Produce the nev Qualities exhibited by thoſe Bodies their Action changes, by any other way, then by changing the Texture, or Motion, or ſome other Mechanical Affection of the Body wrought upon. And ihis if I can in anyPaſſable meaſure do,though butin a generall ay,in ſome or other of each of theſe Three Sorts, into which the Peripatetics are wont to Divide the Qualities of Bodits, Ihope I ſhall have Præface, done no uſeleſſe Piece of Service to Natural Philoſophy, Partly by exciting You, and Tour Learned Friends, to Enquire after more Intelligible and satisfactory wayes of explicating Qualities, and Partly by Beginning ſuch a Collection of Materials towards the Hiſtory of thoſe Qualities, that I ſhall the moſt largely inſiſt on, as Heat,Colours, Fluidity and Firmneſſe, as may invite You, and other Ingenious i en, to contribute alſo their Experiments, and Obſervations 10 ſold ſefull avvork, and thereby lay a soundation, hereon Tou, and perhavs I, may ſuperſtruct a more Diſtinct and Explicite Theory of Qualities, then I ſhall at preſent adventure at, And though I Know, that ſome of the ihings my Experiments tend to Manifeſt, may likeniſe be Confirmd by the more obvious Phæanomena of Nature, yet I Præſume Tou will not diſlike my Choſing to entertaine Tou with the Former, (though without at all De ſpiſing, or ſo much as ſtrictly forbearing to Employ the Latter,) becauſe the Changes of Qualities made by Our Experiments will for the moſt part be more Quick & Conſpicuous,and the agents made use of to produce them, bting of our own Applying, and oftenti mes of our own Praeparationwe may be thereby aſſiſted the better to judge of what they Are, and tomake an aestimate of what tis they Do. CONS IDERATIONS, AN D EXPERIMENT S touching the Origine of Qualities, and Forms. The Theoricall Part. That before I deſcend to Particulars, I may (Pyrophilus) furniſh vou with ſome General Apprehenſion of the Doctrine (or rather the Hypotheſis 5,) which is to be Collated with, and ?o be either Confirmed, or Diſproved by, the Hiſtoricall Truihs, that will be deliverd concerning Particuler Qualities, (& Forms;) rian, and here, at the Entrance, give you (in a general way)a brief Account oſ the Hypotheſis it ſelfe, as it concernes the Origine of Qualities (and Forms:) and for Diſtinctions ſake, I ſhall comprize it in the Eight following Particulars, which, that the whole Scheme may be the better Comprehended, and as it were Survey d under one Proſpect, Iſhall do little more then Barely propoſe Them, that either ſeem evident enough by their owne Light, or may without Præjudice have diverſe of their Proofes reſervd for proper places in the following part of this Treatiſe: and though there be ſome other Particulars, to whichthe Importance of the Subjects, and the Greatneſſe of the (almoſt Univerſall) Prejudices, that lye againſt them, vvill oblige mee Immediately to annexe (for the ſeaſonable Clearing, and Juſtifying of them) ſome Annotations: yet that they may, as Little as I can, Obſcure the Cohærence of the vvhole Diſcourſe, as ſhall be intluded in T Paratheſes. I. Iagree with the generality of Philoſophers ſo far, as to allow, that there is one Catholick or Univerſal Matter common to all Bodies, by which I mean a Subſtãance extended, diviſible and impenetrable. II. But becauſe this Matter being in its own Nature but one, the diverſ ity we ſee in Bodies muſt neceſſarily ariſe from ſomewhat elſe, then the Matter they conſiſt of. And ſince we ſee not, how there could be any change in Matter, ifall its actual or deſignable) parts were perpetually at reſt among themſelves, it will follow, that to di ſcriminate the Catholick Matter I into variety of Natural Bodies, it muſt have Motion in ſome or all ĩts deſignable Parts: and that Motion muſt have various tendencies, that which is in this part of the Matter tending one way, and that which is. in that part tending another; as we plainly ſee in the Univerſe or general Maſs of Matter there is really a great quantity of Motion, and that variouſly determin'd, and that yet diverſe portions of Matter are at reſt. That there is Local Motion in many parts of Matter is manifeſt to ſenſe, but how Matter came by this Motion was of Old, and is ſtill hotly diſputed ot: for the antient Corpuſcularian Philoſophers, (whoſe doctrine in moſt other points, though not in all, we are the moſt inclinable to, )not acknowledging an Author of the Univerſe, were thereby reduc'd to make Motion congenite to Matter, and conſequently coẽval with it; but ſince Local Motion, or an Endeavour at it, is not included in the nature of Matter, which is as much Matter, when it reſts, as when it moves; and ſince we ſee, that the ſame portion of Matter may from Motion be reducd to Rẽſt, and aſter it hath continud at Reſt, as long as other Bodies doe not put it oꝶ of that ſtate, may by external Agents be ſet à moving again; I, who am not wont to think a man the worſe Naturaliſt for not being an Atheiſt, ſhall not ſcruple to ſay with an Eminent Philoſopher of Old, whom I find to have propoſid among the Greeks that Opinion(for the main) that the Excellent Des Cartes hath revived amongſt Us, That the Origine oſ Motionin Matter is from God; and not onely ſo, but that thinking it very unfit to be believ'd, that Matter barely put into Motion; and then leſt to it ſelf, ſould Caſually conſtitute. this beautiful and orderly World: I think alſo further, that the wiſe Author of Things did by eſtabliſh. ing the laws of Motion among Bodies, and by guiding the firſt Motions of the ſmall parts of Matter, bring them to' convene after the manner requiſite to compoſe the World, and eſpecially did contrive thoſe curious and elaborate Engines, the bodies of living CreàC power of propagãting their Species: But though theſe things are my Perſwaſions, yet becauſe they are not neceſſary to be ſuppoſd here, where I doe not pretend to deliver any compleat Diſcourſe of the Principles of Natural Philophy, but onely to touch upon ſuch Notions. as are requiſite to explicate the Origine of Qualities and Forms, I ſhall paſs on to what remains, as ſoon asI have taken notice, that Local uotion ſeems to be indeed ihe Principl amongſt Second Caules, and the Grand Agent of all that happens in Nature: For though Bull, Figure, Reſt, Situation, and Texture do concurre to the Phænomena of Nature, yet in compariſon of Motion they ſeem to be in many Caſes, Effects, and in many others, little beæter then Conditions, or Requiſites, or Cauſes ſine quibus non, which modifie the operation, that one part of Matter nother: as in a Watch, the number, thè figure, and coaptation of the Wheels and other parts is requiſite to the ſewing the hour, and doing the other things that may be performd by the Warch; but till theſe parts be actually put into Motion, all their other affections remaine inefſicacious: and ſo in a Key, thoughif it were too big, or too little, or if its Shape were incongruous to that of the cavity of the Lock, it would be un. fit to be uſd as a Key, though it were put into Motion, yet let its bigneſs and figure be never ſo fit, unleſs actual Motion intervene, it will never lock or unlock any thing, as without the like actual Motion, neither a Knife nor Raſor will actually cut, how much ſoever their ſhape & other Qualities may ſit them to do ſo. And ſo Brimſtone, what diſpoſition of Parts ſoever it have to be turnd into Flame, would never be kindled, unleſs ſome actual fire, or other parcel of vehemently and variouſly agitated Matter ſhould put the Sulphureous Corpuſcles into a very brisk motion. III. Theſe two grand and moſt Catholick Principles of Bodies, Matter, and Motion, being thus eſtabliſyd, it will follow both, that Matter muſt be actually divided into Parts, that being the genuine Effect of variouſly determid Motion, and that each of the primitive Fragments, or other diſtinct and entire Maſſes of Matter muſt have two Attributes, its own Magnitude, or rather Size, and its own Figure or Shape. And ſince Experience ſhews us (eſpecially that which is afforded us by Chymical Operations, in many of which Matter is divided into Parts, too ſmall to be ſingly ſenſible,) that this diviſion of Matter is frequently made into inſenſible Corpuſcles or Particles, we may conclude, that the minuteſt fragments, as well as the biggeſt Maſſes of the Univerſal Matter are likewiſe endowed each with its peculiar Bulk and Shape. For being a finite Body,; its Dimenſions muſt be terminated and meaſurable: and though it may change its Figure, yet for the ſame reaſon it muſt neceſſarily have ſome Fiqure or other. So that now we have found out, and muſt admit three Eſſential Properties of each entire or undivided, though inſenſible part of Matter, namely, Maęnitude, 7by which I mean not quantity in general, but a determin'd quantity, which we in Engliſh oftentimes call the Size of a bodie,) Shape, and either Motion or Reſt, (for betwixt them two there is no mean:) the two firſt of which may be called inſeparable Accidents ofeach diſtinct part of Matter: inſeparable, becauſe being extended, and yet finite, it is Phyfſically impoſſible, that it ſhould be devoid of ſome Bulk or other, and ſom determinate Shape or other; and yet Accidents, becaulę that whether or no the Shape can by Phyſical Agents be alter'd or the Body ſubdiG vided, vet mentally both the one and the other may be done, the whole eſſence of Matter remaining undeſtroy dl. YWhether theſe Accidents may not conveniently enough be call'd the Moods or primary affections of Bodies, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe leſie ſimple Qualities, (as Colours, Taſtes, and Odours,) that belong to Bodies upon their account, or whether with the Epicureans they may not be called the Conjuncts of the ſmalleſt parts of Matter, Ihall not now ſtay to conſider, but one thing the Modern Schools are wont to teach concerning Accidents, which is too repugnant to our preſent Doctrine, to be in this place quite omitted, namely that there are in Natural Bodies ſtore ot real Qualitics, and other real Accidents, which not onely are no Moods of Matter, but are real Entities diſtinct from it, and according to the doctrine of many modern Schoolmen may exiſt ſeparate from all Matter whatſoever. To clear this point ã little, we muſt take notice, that Accident is among Logicians and Philoſophers uſd in two ſeveral ſenſes, for ſometimes it-is oppoſd to the 4th Prædicable, (Property,) and is then defin'd, c that which may be preſent or abſent, without the deſtruction of the ſubject; as a Man may be ſick or well, and a Wall white or not white, and yet the one be ſtill a Man, the other a Wall; and this is call'd in the Schools Accidens præedicabile, to diſtinguiſh it from what they call Accidens pradicamentale, which is o ppoſd to Subſtance: ſor when things are divided by Logicians into 10 Prædicaments, or higheſt genuses of things, Subſtance making one of them, allthe nine other are of Accidents. And as Subſtance is commonly deſind to be a thing that ſubſiſts of it ſelf, and is the ſubject of Accidents, (or more plainly, a real Entity or thing, that needs not any (created) Being, that it may exiſ⸗ ſo an Accident is ſaid commonly to be id cujus eſſe eſt ineſſe, and therefore 4riſtotle, who uſually calls Subſtances ſimply ioi, Entities, moſt commonly calls Accidents à7& ĩræ, Entities of Entities. Theſe needing the exiſtence of ſome ſubſtance or other, in which they may be, as in their ſubject of Inhæſion. And becauſe Logicians make it the diſcriminating note of Subſtance, and Accident, that the former is a thing that cannot be in another, as in its ſubject of Inhæſion, tis requiſite to know, that according to them, That is ſaid to Be in a Subjec?, which hath theſe three conditions; That however it 0) be in another thinug, (2) is not in it as a part, and (3) cannot exiſt ſeparately from the thing or ſubject, wherein it is: as a white Wall is the ſubject of Inhæſion of the whiteneſs we ſee in it, which ſelfſame whiteneſs, though it be not in the wall as a part of ĩt, yet cannot the ſelfſame cians exiſt any where out of the wall, though many other Bodies may have the like degree of whiteneſs. This premiſd, twill not be hard to diſcover the falſity of the lately mentioned Scholaſtick opinion touching real Qualities and Accidents, their doctiine about which does, I confeſs, appear to me to be either unintelligible, or manifeſtly contradictious: for ſpeaking in a Phyſical ſenſe, if they will not allow theſe Accidents to be Modes of Matter, but Entities really diſtinct from it, and in ſome caſes ſeparable from all Matter, they make them indeed Accidents in name, but repreſent them under ſuch a notion as belongs onely to Subſtances; the nature of a Subſtance conſiſting in this, That it can ſubſiſt of it ſelfe, without being in any thing elſe, as in a ſubject of Inhæ ſion: ſo that to tell us, that a Quality, or other Accident may ſubſiſt without a ſubject, is indeed, whatever they pleaſe to call it, to allow it the true Nature of Subſtance, nor will their Groundleſſe Diſtinctions do any more then keep them from ſeeming to contradict themſelves in words, whilſt Unprepoſſeſs'd perſons ſee that they do iĩt in effect: Nor could Iever find ĩt intelligibly made out, what theſe real Quilities may be, that they deny. to be either Matter or modes of Matter, or immaterial Subſt ances, When a Bowl runs along or lies ſtill, that Mmotion or Reſt, or Globous figure of the Bowl, is not Nothing, and yet it is not any part of the Bowl; whoſe whole Subſtance would remain, though it wanted which you pleaſe of theſe Accidents: and to make them real and phyſical Entities, ſfor we have not here to do either with Logical or Metaphyſical ones) is, as if, becauſe we may conſider the ſame Man ſitting, ſtanding, running, thirſty, hungrie, wearie, &c. we ſhould make. each of theſe àa diſtinct Entitie, as. we do give ſome of themſas hunger, wearineſs; &c. ) diſtinct names. Whereas the ſubject of all theſe Qualities is but the ſame Man as he is conſidered with Circumſtances, that mauke him appear different in one caſe from what he appears in another: And it may be very uſeful to our preſent Scope to obſerve, that not onely diverſity of Names, but even diverſity of Definitions, doth not alwaies infer a diverſity of Phyſical Entities in the Subject, whereunto they are attributed. For it happens in mny of the Phyſical Attributes of a Body, as in thoſe Other caſes, wheremm a Man that is a Father, a Husband, a Maſter, a Prince, &c. may have a Peculiar Definition (ſuch as the Nature of the thing will bear) belong unto him in each of theſe Capacities, and yet the Man in himſelf conſidered is but the ſame Man, who in reſpect of differing Cupacities or Relations to other things is call'd by differing Names, and deſcrib d by various Deſinitions, which yet (as I was ſaying) conclude not ſo many real and diſtinct Entities in the perſon ſo variouſly denominated. An : EXCORS ION about the Relative Nature of Phyſical Qualities. Ut becauſeI take this Notion to be of no Small Importance towards the Avoiding of the Grand Miſtake, that hath hitherto obtaind about the Nature of Qualities, it will be worth while to Illuſtrate it a little farther. We may conſider then, that when Tubal- cain, or whoever elſe were the Smith, that Invented Locks and Xeyes, had made his firſt Lock, (for we may Reaſonably ſuppoſe him to have mãde pariſon may be made uſe of without that Suppoſition,) That was onely a Piece of Iron, contrivd into ſuch a Shape; and when aſterwards he made a Key to that Locl, That alſo in it ſelf Conſider'd, was nothing but a Piece of Iron of ſuch a Determinate Figure: but in Regard that theſe two Pieces of Iron might now be Applied to one another after a Certain manner, and that there was a Congruitie betwixt the Wards of the Lock and thoſe of the Key, the Lock and the Key did each of them now Obtain a new Capacity, and it became a Main part of the Motion and Deſcription of a Lock, that it was capable of being made to Lock or UnIock by that other Piece of Iron we call a Key, and it was Lookd upon as a Peculiar Faculty and Power in the Xey, that it was Fitted to Open and Shut the Lock, and yet by theſe new Attributes there was not added any Real or Phyſical Entity, either to the Lock, or to the Xey, cach of them remaining indeed nothing, but the ſame Piece of Iron, juſt ſo Shopd as it was before. And when our Smith made other Keyes of diftering Bigneſſes, or with Differing Wards, though the firſt Lock was not to be open d by any oſthoſe Keyes, yet that Indiſpoſition, however it might be Conſiderd as a peculiar Power oſ Reſiſiſting this or that Key, and might ſerve to Diſcriminate it ſufficiently from the Locks thoſe Keyes belongd to, was nothing new in the Lock, or diſtinct from the Figure it had before thoſe Keyes were made. To carrie this Compariſon a little Further, let me adde, that though one that would have Defin'd the Firſt Lock, and the Firſt Key, would have Given them diſtinct Deſinitions with Reference to each other; and yet (as I was ſaying) theſe Definitions being given but upon the Score of Certain Reſpects, which the Defin'd Bodies had One to Another, would not infer, that theſe two Iron Inſtruments did Phyſically differ otherwiſe then in the Figure, Size, or Contrivement of the Iron, whereoſ each of them conſiſted. And proportionably hereunto I do not ſee, vhy we may not conceive, That as to thoſe Qualities ( for Inſtance) which we call Senſible, though by virtue of a certain Congruity or Incongruity in point of Figure or Texture, (or other Mechanical Attributes,) to our Senſories, the Portions oſ Matter they Modifie are enabled to produce various Efſects, upon whoſe account we make Bodies to be Endowd with Qualities; yet They are not in the Bodies that are Endowd with them any Real or Diſtinct Entities, or diftering from the Matter its ſelf, furniſhd with ſuch a Determinate Bigneſs, Shape, or other Mechanical Modifications. Thus though the modern Gold- Smiths and Refſiners reckon amongſt the moſt diſtinguiſhing Qualities o? Gold, by which men may be certain of its being True, and not Sophiſticated, that is eaſily diſſoluble in 49ua Regis, and that A4qua Fortis will not work uponit; yvet theſe Attributes are not in the Gold any thing diſtinct from its peculiar Texture, nor is the Gold we have now of any other Nature, then it was in Pliny's time, when Aqua Fortis and Aqua Regis had not been Found out, (at Ieaſt in theſe parts of the World,) and were utterly unknown to the Roman Gold- Smiths. And this Example Ihave the rather pitch'd upon, becauſe it affords me an Opportunity to repreſent, that, unleſs we admit the Doctrine Ihave been Propoſing, we muſt Admit, that a Body may have an almoſt Infinite Number of New Real Entities accruing to it, without the Intervention of any Phyſical Change in the Body its ſelf. As for Example, Gold was the ſame Natural Body immediately before Aqua Regis and Aqua Fortis were firſt made, as it was _ was immediately aſter, and yet nov tis reckond amongſt its Principal Froperties, that it.is diſſoluble by the Former of thoſe two Menſtruums, and that it is not like other Mettals Diſſoluble or Corrodible by the Latter. And if one ſhould Invent another Menſtruum, (as poſſibly Imay Think my ſelſ Maſter of ſuch a one) that will but in part diſſolve pure Gold, and change ſome part of it into another Metalline Body, there ill then ariſe another new Property, whereby to diſtinguiſ That ſrom other Mettals; and yet the Nature of Gold is not a whit other now, then it was before this laſt Menſtruum was firſt made. There are ſome Bodies not Cathartick, nor Sudoriſick, with ſome of which Gold being joynd acquires a Purgative Vertue, and with others a power to procure Sweat; and in a word, Nature her ſelſr doth, ſometimes otherwiſe, and ſometimes by Chance, produce ſo many things, that have new Relations unto ol D 2 thers: /mrchò thers: And Art, eſpecially aſſiſted by Chymiſtry, may, by variouſly diſſipating Natural Bodies, or Compounding either them, or their Conſtituent Parts with one another, make ſuch an Innumerable Company of new Productions, that will each of Them have new operations, either immediately upon our Senſories, or upon other Bodies, whoſe Changes we are able to perceive, that no man can know, but that the moſt Familiar Bodies may have Multitudes of Qualities, that he dreams not of, and a Conſidering man will hardly imagine, that ſo numerous a Croud of real Phyſical Entities can accrue to a Body, whilſt in the Judgment of all our Senſes it remains Unchang d, and the Same that twas before. To clear this a little farther, we may adde, that beaten Glaſs is commonly reckond among Poiſons; and (to skip what is mentiond out of Sanctorius, of ments of it) I remember *cardan hath a ſtory, That in a Cloiſter, where he had a Patient then like to die of torments in the Stomach, two other Nuns had been already killd by a diſtracted Woman, that having Caſually got Free, had mixt beaten Glaſs with Peaſe, that were eaten by theſe three, and diverſe others of the Siſters (ho yet eſcap'ò unharmd.) Now though the powers of Poiſons be not onely lookd upon as real Qualities, but are reckoned among the Abſtruſeſt ones: yet this Deleterious Faculty, which is ſuppoſd to be a Peculiar and Superadded Entitie in the beaten Glaſſe, is really nothing diſtinct from the Glaſs its ſelf, (which though a Concrete made up of thoſe Innocent Ingredients, Salt and Aſhes, is yet a hard and ſtiffe Body,) as it is furniſd with that determinate Bigneſs, and Figure of Parts, which have been acquird * Cardan: contradiſt. 9.lib. 2. Tract. 5.a pud Schenckium. by Comminution. For theſe Glaſſy Fragments being many, and Rigid, and ſomewhat Small, (without vet being ſo ſmall as Duſt,) and endowd with ſharp Points and cutting Edges, are enabled by theſe Mechanical Affections to Pierce or Wound the tender Membranes of the Stomach and Guts, and cut the ſlender Veſſels thet they meet with there, whereby naturally enſue great Gripings and Contorſions of the injur d Parts, and oſtentimes Bloudy Fluxes occaſion'd by the perforation of the Capillary Arteries, and the great irritation of the Expulſive Faculty, and ſometimes alſo not onely horrid Convulſions by Conſent of the Drain and Cerebellum, with ſome of the Nervous or Membranous parts tha: happen to be hurt, but alſo Dropſies occaſioned by the great loſs of Bloud we were juſt now ſpeaking oſ. And it agrees very well with this Conjecture, that beaten Glaſs hath diverſe times been obſerv'd to have done no Miſchief to Animals tha: have ſwallowed it: For there is no Reaſon it ſould, in caſe the Corpuſcles of the Powder either chance to be ſo ſmall, as not to be fit to wound the Guts, which are uſually lind with a ſlimy ſubſtance, wherein very minute Powders may be as it vvere ſheath'd, and by that means hinderd from hurting the Guts, (inſomuch that a fragment of Glaſc vvith three very ſharp corners, hath been obſerv'd to have for above eighteen Months lain* inoffenſive even in a nervous and very ſenſible part of the body,) out of vvhich they may with the groſſer Excrements of the Lower Belly be harmeleſly Excluded,  This memorable Accident happend to a Senator of Berne, who was cur'd by the Experienc d Fabricius Hild anus, that gives a long Account of it to the Learned Horſiius, among whoſe Obſervations tis extant: (Lil. 2. obſerv. 35.) who aſcribes the Indolence of the Pare, whilſt uncompreſied, to ſome ſſimy Juice, (familiar enough to thoſe Tendinous parts,) wherein the Glaſſy fragment was as it were Beddęd, eſpecially in ſome Individuals, whoſe Guts and Stomach too may be of a much ſtronger Texture, and better Lind or Stuff'd with Groſs and Slimy Matter, then thoſe of others. And accordingly we ſee, that the Fragments of Saphires, Chriſtals, and evn Rubies, which are much harder then Glaſs; are innocently, though perhaps not very effectually usd by Phyſicians, (and I have ſeveral times taken That without Inconvenience) in Cordial Compoſitions, becauſe of their being by Grinding reduc'd to a Powder too Subtle to Excoriate, or Grate upon the Stomach, or Guts; and probably twas upon ſome ſuch Account, that That happend which is related by &ardan in the ſame place, namely, That though the three Nuns we have been ſpeaking of were Poiſond by the Glaſs, yet many others who eat of the other Portions of the ſome mingled Peaſe, receivd no miſchief thereby. ( But of this ſubject more V elſewhere.) And this puts me in mind to adde, That the Multiplicity of Qualities, that are ſometimes to be met with in the ſame Matural Bodies, needs not make men reject the Opinion we have been propoſing, by perſwading them, that ſo many Differing Attributes, as may be ſometimes found in one and the ſime Natural Body, cannot proceed from the bare Texture, and other Mechanical Aftections of its Matter. For we muſt conſider each Body, not barely as itis in it ſelf an entire and diſtinct portion of Matter, but as it is a Part of the Univerſe, and conſequently plac'd among a great Number and Vuriety of other Bodies, upon which it may Act, and by which it may be acted on, in many waies, (or upon many Accounts,) each of which Men are wont to Fancy,  In thoſe Notes about Occult Qualities, where the Deleterious Faculty attributed to Diamonds is conſidered. ãs a diſtinct Power or Quality in the Body, by which thoſe Actions, or in which thoſe Paſſions are produc'd. For if we thus conſider Things, we ſnall not much wonder, that a Portion of Matter, that is indeed endowd but with a very few Mechanical Affections, as ſuch a determinãte Texture and Motion, but is placd among a multitude of other Bodies, that difter in thoſe Attributes from it, and one another, ſhould be capable of having a great Number and Variety of Relations to thoſe other Bodies, and conſequently ſhould be thought to have many Diſtinct Inhærent Qualities, by ſuch as look upon thoſe ſeveral Relations or Reſpects it may have to Bodies without it, as Real and Diſtinct Entities implanted in the Body it ſelf. When a Curious Watch is going, though the Spring be that which puts all the Parts into Motion, yvet we do not Fancie (as an Indian or chinois would perchance do) in this Spring one Faculty to move the Index uniformely round the Dial-plate, another to ſtrike the Hour, and perhaps a Third to give an Alarme, or ſnew the Age of the Moon, or the Tides; all the action of the Spring, (which is but a ſlexible piece of Steel, forcibly coil'd together,) being but an Endeavour to dilate or unbind its ſelf, and the reſt being performd by the various Reſpects it hath to the ſeveral Bodies ſthat compoſe the Watch) among which it is placd, and which they have One to another. We all know, that the Sun hath a power to Harden Ciay, and Soften Wax, and Melt Butter, and Thaw Ice, and turn Water into Vapours, and make Air expand it ſelf in WeatherGlaſſes, and contribute to Blanch Linnen, and make the White skin of the Face Swarthy, and Mowed Graſs Yellow, and ripen Fiuit, hatch the Eggs of Silk- worms, Caterpillars, and the like Inſects, and perform I know not how many many other things, divers of which ſeem contrary Effects, and yet theſe are not diſtinct Powers or Faculties in the Sun, but onely the Productions of its Heat, (which it ſelfis but the brisk, and confuſd Local Motion of the Minute parts ofa Body, ) diverſifyd by the differing Textures of the Body that it chances to work upon, and the Condition of the other Bodies that are concern'd in the Operation. And therefore whether the Sun in ſome caſes ave any Influence at all diſtinct from its Light and Heat, we ſee, that all thoſe Phænomena we have thought fit to name are producible by the heat of the common Culinary Fire duly apply:d and regulated. And ſo, to give an Inſtance of another Xind, when ſome years. ſince, to Try ſome Experiments about the Propagation of Motion, with Bodies leſs capable of being batterd by one another, then thoſe that have been formerly imploy'd; I caus'd ſome ſolid Bals of Iron skilfully harded, and exquiſitely ſhap'd and gla2d, to be purpoſely made; each of theſe poliſhed Balls was a S phærical Looking- Glaſs, which placd in the mid ſt of a Room, would exhibit the Images ofthe Objects round about it, in a very regular and pleaſing Perſpective. It would Contract the Image, and Reĩect the Beams of the Sun, after a manner differing from Flat and from Convex Looking Glaſſes. It would in a neat Perſpective leſſen the Image of him that look’d upon it; and bend it, and it would ſhew that Image, as if it were behind the Surtface, and within the ſolid ſubſtance of the Sphære, and in ſome it had all thoſe Diſtinct, and ſome of them wonderful Properties, which either Antient or Modern Writers of Catoptricks have demonſtrated to belong to Sphærical Specula, as ſuch: and yet the Globe furniſ'd with all theſe Properties and Affections, was but the Iron it ſelf reducd by the Artificer to a Sphærical Figure, (for the Glaſs, that made it Specular, was not diſtinct from the Supe:ficial parts of the Iron, reducd all of them to a Phyſically equal diſtance from the Center- And of specula, Sphærical enough as to ſenſe, you may make ſtore in a trice, by breaking a large Drop of Quick ſilver into ſeveral little ones, each of which will ſerve for Objects plac d pretty near it, and the ſmaller of which ( being the Jeaſt depreſsd in the middle by their own weight, and conſequently more perfectly Globous,) may with a good Microſcope placd in a Window afford you nò unpleaſant proſpect of the neighbouring Objects, and yet to reduce a par cel of Stagnant Quickſilver, which will much æmulate a Flat LookingGlaſs, into many of theſe little Sphærical Specula, whoſe Properties are ſo differing from thoſe of Plaim ones, there intervenes nothing but a ſleight Local Motion, which in the twinckling of an Eye changeth the Figure of the ſelf ſame Matter. lll I have ſaid thus much ( Pyrophilus) to remove the Miſtake, That every thing men are wont to call 4 Quality, muſt needs be a Real and Phyſical Entity, becauſe of the Importance of the Subject; and yet IThave omitted ſome things that might have been pertinently added, partly becauſe I may hereafter have Opportunity to take them in, and partly becauſe I would not any farther lengthen this Excurſion, which yet I muſt not Conclude, till I have added this ſnort Advertiſement. That I have choſen to Declare what I mean by Qualities, rather by Examples, then Definitions, parily becauſe being immediately or reductively the Objects of ſenſe, Men generally underſtand pretty well what one another mean, when they are ſpoken of: (As to ſay, that the Taſt of ſuch a thing is Saline or Sowr, or that ſuch a Sound is Melodious, Shrill, or Jarring, (eſpecially if when we ſpeak of Senſible Qualities, we adde ſome Enumeration of particular Subjects, wherein they do the moſt Eminently reſide,) will make a Man as ſoon underſtood, as if he ſhould go about to give Logical Definitions of rhoſe Qualities:) and partly becauſe the Notions of things are not yet ſo well ſtated, and agreed on, but that it is many times difficult to Aſſign their tiue Genus's: and Ariſtotle himſelf doth not onely define Accidents without ſetting down their Genus, but when he comes to define Qualities, he tels us, that Quality is that by which a thing is ſaid to be RQualis, here I would have you take notice both, that in his Deſinition he omits the Genus, and that tis no ſuch eaſy Thing to give a very good Definiti. on of Qualities, ſince he that is reputed the great Maſter of Logick, where he pretends to give us one, doth but upon the matter define the thing by the ſame thing, fortis ſuppoſſd to be as little known what Qualis is, as what Qualitas is, and me thinks he does juſt as if I ſhould define Whiteneſs to be that, for which a thing is called White, or Vertue, that for which a Man is ſaid to be Vertuous . Beſides that, I much NN§N NYNNDD F Since the writing of this, the Autlior found, that ſome of the E minenteſt of the modern Schoolmen themſelves, have been, as well as he, unſatisfied with the Ariſtotelian Deſinition of Quality: concerning which (not to mention Revius, a Learned Pioteſtant Annotator upon Suarc].) Ariaga ſayes (diſp. 5.ſect. 2.ſubſ. 1.) Per hanc nihil explicatur; nam de hoc quærimus, quid ſit eſſe qual-,dices habere qualitatem ; boaus Circulus: qualitas est id quo quis ſit qualis, & eſſe qualem eſt habere Quialitat. m. And even the famous Jeſuit Suareæ, though he endeavours to excuſe it, yet confeſſeth, that it Jeaves the proper Notion of Quality as obſcure to us as betore: Quæ d finitio, ſaith he, licẽt ea ratione eſſentialis videatur, quod detur per habitudinem ad effectum formalem, quem omnis Forma cſſentialiter veſvicit, tamen quod aã nos ſpectat, æaquẽ obſctura nobis manet propria ratio Quilitatis.) Suareę Diſputat. Metaphyſic. 42. But Hurtadus ſin his Metaphy ſizal Diſputations) ſpeaks mo. e buldly, telling us roundly, thatit is Non tam Deſinitio, quãm inanis quædam Nugatio, vhich makes me the more wonder, that a famous Carteſian ſwhom I forbear to name) ſhould content himſelf to give us ſuch an Inſigniſicant, or at Ileaſt Superſicial Deſnition of Quality. coubt, doubt, whether his Defſinition be not Untrue as well as Obſcure, for to the Queſtion, Qualis res eſt? Anſwer may be return'd out of ſome, if not all of the other Prædicaments of Accidents: which ſome of the Modern Logicians being aware ol, they have endeavoured to ſalve the matter with certain Cautions and Limitations, which however they may argue the Deviſors to be ingenious, do, for ought Ican diſcern, Ieave us ſtill to ſeek tor a right and intelligible Definition of Quality in general, though to give ſuch a one be probably a much eaſier Task, then to define many Qualities, that may be namd in particular, as Saltneſs, Sowrneſs, Green, Blew, and many others, which when we hear namd, every man knows what is meant by them, though no man ſthat I know of) hath been able to give accurate Definitions of them. IV. And if we ſnould conceive, that except any of theſe entire and undivided Corpuſcles, (treated oſ in the 36 Particular foregoing,) it is hard to ſay what could be attributed to it, beſides Matter, Motion ſor Reſt,) Bulk, and Shape, (whence by the way you may take notice, that Bulk, though uſually taken ina Comparative ſenſe, is in our ſenſe an abſolute Thing, ſince a Body would have it, though there were no other in the World.) But now there being ãctually in the Univerſe great Multitudes of Corpuſcles mingled among themſelves, there ariſe in any diſtinct portion of Matter, which a number of them make up, two new Accidents or Events: the one doth more relate to each particular Corpuſcle in reference to the (really or ſuppo. ſedlv) ſtable Bodies ahout it, namely its Poſture; (whether Erected, Inclin'd, or Horizontal:) And, when two or more of ſuch Bodies are plac'd one by anorher, the manner of their being ſo plac'd, as one beſides another, or one behind another, may be call'd theit Order; as I remember, Ariſtotle in his Metaphyſicks, lib. 1.cap. A. recites this Example out of the antient Corpuſcularians, That 4 and N differ in Figurce, and 4 N and N 4 in order, Z and N in Scituation: and indeed Poſture and Order ſeem both of them reducible to Scituation. And when many Corpuſcles do ſo convene together as to compoſe any diſtinct Body, as a Stone, orã Mettal, then from their other Accidents or Modes,) and from theſe two laſt mentiond, there doth emerge a certain Diſpoſition or Contrivance of Parts in the whole, which we may call the Texture of it. V. And if we ſould conceive all the reſt of the Univerſe to be annihilated. ?ave one ſuch Body, ſuppoſe a Mettal or a Stone, it were hard to ſhew, that there is Phyſically any thing more in it then Matter, and the Accidents we have already named. But now we are to conſider, that there are de facto in the world certain ſenſible and rational Be. ings, that we call Men, and the body of Man having ſeveral of its external parts, as the Eye, the Ear, &c. each of a diſtinct and peculiar Texture, whereby it is capable to receive Impreſſions from the Bodies about it, and upon that account it is call'd an Organ of Senſe, we muſt conſider, Iſay, that theſe Senſories may be wrought upon by the Figure, Shape, Motion, and Texture of Bodies without them, aſter ſeveral waies, ſome of thoſe External Bodies being fitted to aſfect the Eve, others the Ear, others the Noſtrils, &c. And to theſe Operations of the Objects on the Senſories, the Mind of Man, which upon the account of its Union with the Body perceives them, giveth diſtinct Names, c”lling the one Light or Colour, the other Sound, the other. Odour, &c. And becauſe alſo each Organ of Senſe, as the Eye, or the Palat, may be it ſelf differingly affected by External Objects, the Mind likewiſe gives the Objects of the ſame Senſe diſtinct Appellations, calling one colour Green, the other Blew, and one taſt Sweet, and another Bitter, &c. Whence Men have been inducd to frame a long Catalogue of ſuch Things as, for their relating to our Senſes, we call Senſible Qualities; and becauſe we have been converſant with them, before we had the uſe of Reaſon, and the Mind of Man is prone to conceive almoſt every Thing (nay even Privations, as Blindneſs, Death, &c.) under the notion of a true Entitie or Subſtance as it ſelfis; we have been from our Infancy aptto imagine, that theſe Senſible Qualities are Real Beings, in the Objects they denominate, and have the faculty or power to work ſuch and ſuch things; as Gravity hath a power to ſtop the motion of a Billet ſliot upwards, and carry that ſolid Globe of Matter toward the Center of the Earth, whereas indeed (according to what we have largely ſhewn above) there is in the Body, to which theſe Senſible Qualities are attributed, nothing of Real and Phyſical, but the Size, Shape, and Motion, or Reſt of its component Particles, together with that Texture of the whole, which reſults from their being ſo contrivd as they are; nor is it neceſſary they ſhould have in them any thing more, like to the Ideas they occaſion in us, thoſe Ideãs being either the Effects of our Præjudices, or Inconſiderateneſs, or elſe to be fetcht from the Relation, that happens to be betwixt thoſe Primary Accidents oſ the Senſible Object, and the peculiar Texture of the Organ it affects; as when a Pin, being run into my Finger, cauſeth pain, there is no diſtinct Quality in the Pin anſwerable to what Iam apt to fancie Pain to be, but the Pin in it ſelfis onely ſlender, ſtiff, and ſharp, and by thoſe qualities happens to make a Solution of Continuity in my Organ of Touching, upon which, by reaſon of the Fabrick of the Body, and the intimate Union of the Soul with it, there ariſeth that troubleſome kind of Perception,which we call Pain, ind Iſhall 2Znon more purticularly ſnhew, how much that de pends upon the peculiar fabrick of the Body. VI. But here I fereſee a Difficulty, which being perhaps the chiefeſt, that we ſhall meet with agãinſt the Corpuſcular Hypotheſis, it will deſerve to be, before we proceed any farther, taken notice of. And it is this, that, whereas we explicate Colours, Odours, and the like ſenſible Qualities by a relation to our Senſes, it ſeems evident, that they have an abſolute Being irrelative tolis; for, Snow (for inſtance would be white, and a glowing Coal would be hor, though there were no Man or any other Animal in the World: and tis plain, that Bodies do not onely by their Qualities work upon our ſenſes, but upon other, and thoſe, Inanimate Bodies; as the Coal will not onely heat or burna Mans hand if he touch it, but would likewiſe heat Wax, ſeven ſo much as to melt it, and make it flow,) and thaw Ice into Water, though all the Men, and ſenſitive Beings in the World were annihilated. To clear this Difficulty, I have ſeveral things to repreſent, and, I. Iſaynot, that there are no other Accidents in Bodies then Colours, Odours, and the like; for I have already taught, that there are ſimpler and more Primitive Affections of Matter, from which theſe Secondary Qualities, if I may ſo call them, do depend: and that the Operations of Bodies upon one another ſpring from the ſame, we ſhall ſee by and by. 2. Nor do Iſay, that all Qualities of Bodies are directly Senſible; but I oblll ſerve, that when one Body works upon another, the knowledg we have of their Operation, proceeds, either from ſome ſenſible Quality, or ſome more Catholick affection of Matter, as Motion, Reſt or Texture, generated or deſtroy'd in one of them, for elſe it is hard to conceive, how we ſhould come to diſcover what paſſes betwixt them. 3. We muſt not look upon every diſtinct Body, that works npon our Senſes, as a bare lump of Matter oſ that bigneſs and outward ſhape, that it appears of, many of them having their parts curiouſly contriv'd, and moſt of them perhaps in motion too. Nor muſt we look upon the Univerſe that ſurroundsus, as upon a moveleſs and undiſtinguiſd Heap of Matter, but as upon a great Engine, which, having either no Vacuity, or none that is conſiderable, betwixt its parts (nown to Us,) the actions of particular Bodies upon mated, as if two Portions of Matter of their Bulk and Figure were plac'd in ſome imaginury Space beyond the World, but as being ſcituated in the World, conſtituted as it now is, and conſequently as having their action upon each other liable to be promoted, or hindred, or modifyſd by the Actions ofother Bodies beſides them: as in a Clock, a ſmall force apply’d to move the Index to the Figure of 12, will make the Hammer ſtrike often and forcibly againſt the Bell, and will make a far greater Commotion among the Wheels and Weights, then a far greater force would do, if the Texture and Contrivance of the Clock did not abundantly contribute to the Production of ſo great an Effect. And in agitaiing Water into Froth, the Whiteneſs would never be producd by that Motion, were it not that the Sun, or other Lucid Body, ſhining upon that Aggregate oſ ſmall Bubbles, enables them to reflect confullll ſedly great ſtore of little, and as it ere contiguous lucid images to the Eye. And ſo the giving to a large Metalline Speculum a  Concave figute, would never enable it to ſet Wood on ſire, and even to melt down Mettals reacily, if the Sun beams, that in Cloudleſs dayes do, as to ſenſe, ſill the Air, were not by the help of that Concavity, thrown together to a Point. And to ſhew You by an eminent Inſtance, how various and how differing Effects the Same action of a Natural Agent may produce, according to the ſeveral Diſpoſitions of the Bodies it works upon, do but conſider, that in two Eggs, the one Prolifick, the òther Barren, the ſenſe can perhaps diſtinguiſh before Incubation no difference at all; and yet theſe Bodies, outwardly ſo like, do ſo differ in the internal diſpoſition of their parts, that if they be both ex. poſ4d to the ſame degree of Heat, (whether of a Hen, or an Artificial Oven, ) trid and ſtinking Subſtance, and the other into a Chick, furniſd with great variety of Organical parts of very liffering conſi ſtences, and curious as well as diftering Textures. 4. I do not deny, but that Bodies may be ſaid, in a very favourable ſenſe, to have thoſe Qualities we call Senſible though there were no Animals in the World: ſora Body in that caſe may differ from thoſe Bodies, which now are quite devoid of Quility, in its having ſuch a diſpoſition of its Conſtituent Corpuſcles, that in caſe it were duely apply d to the Senſory o? an Animal, it would produce ſuch a ſenſible Quality, which a Body of another Texture would not; as though if there were no Animals, there would be no ſuch thing as Pain, yet a Pin may upon the account of its Figure be fitted to cauſe pain, in caſe it were movd againſt a Man's finger, whereas a Bullet, or other blunt Body movd againſt it. With no greater force. will not cauſe any ſuch perception of pain. And thus Snow, though if there were no Lucid Body nor Organ of Sight in the World, it would exhibit no Colour at all, (for I could not find it had any in places exactly darkned,) yet it hath a greater diſpoſition then a Coal or Soot to reflect ſtore of Light outwards, when the Sun ſhines upon them all threee. And ſo we ſay, that a Lute is in tune, whether it be actually plaid upon or no, if the Strings be all ſo duly ſtretcht, as that it would appear to be in Tune, if it were playd upon. But as if You ſhould thruſt a Pin into a mans Finger, botha while before and aſter his Death, though the Pin be as ſharp at one time as at another, and moketh in both caſes alikè a Solution of Continuity; yet in the former caſe, the Action of the Pin will produce Pain, and not in the latter, becauſe in this the prickd Body wants the Soule, and conſequently the Perceptive Faculty: ſo if there were no Senſitive Beings, thoſe Bodies that are now the Objects of our Senſes, would be but diſpoſitively, it I may ſo ſpeak, endowd with Colours, Taſts, and the like; and acẽæally but onely with thoſe more Catholick Affections of Bodies, Figure, Motion, Texture, &c. To illuſtrate this yet a little farther, ſuppoſe a Man ſhould beat a Drum at ſome diſtance from the mouth of a Cave, conveniently ſcituated to return the Noiſe he makes; although Men will preſently conclude, that That Cave hath an Echo, and will be apt to fancy upon that account ſome Real Property in the place, to which the Echo is ſaid to belong, and although indeed the ſame Noiſe made in many other oſ the neighbouring places, would not be reflected to the Eare, and conſequently would maniteſt thoſe places to have no Echos; yet to ſpeak Phyiſically of things, this Peculiar Quality or Property perty we fancy in the Cave, is in It nothing elſe but the Hollowneſs of its Figure, whereby tis ſo diſpoſd, as when the Air beats againſt it, to reflect the Motion towards the place whence that Motion began; and that which paſſeth on this occaſion is indeed but this, That the Drum ſtick falling upon the Drum, makes a Percuſſion of the Air, and puts that Fluid Body into an Undulating Motion, and the Aery Waves thruſting on one another, till they arrive at the hollow Superficies oſ the Cave, have by reaſon of its reſiſtance and ſigure, their Motion determin'd the contrary way, namely backwards towards that part where the Drum was, vvhen it vvas ſtruck; ſo that in That, vvhich here happens, there intervenes nothing but the Figure of one Body, and the Motion of another, though if a Mans Ear chance to be in the way of theſe Motions of the Air forwards and backvvards, it gives him a Perception of them, which he calls Sound; and becauſe theſe Perceptions, which are ſupposd to proceed from the ſame percuſſion of the Drum, and thereby of the Air, are made at diſtinct times one after another, That hollow Body, from whence the Laſt Sound is conceivid to come to the Air, is imagind to have a peculiar Faculty, upon whoſe account Men are wont to ſay, that ſuch a place hath an Echo. 5. And whereas one Body doth often ſeem to produce in another divers ſuch Qualities, as we call Senſible, which Qualities therefore ſeem not to need any reference to our Senſes, I conſider, that when one Inanimate Body works upon another, there is nothing really produc-d by the Agent in the Patient, ſave ſome Local Motion ofits Parts, or ſome Change of Texture conſequent upon that Motion; and ſo, if the Patient come to have any ſenſible Quality, that it had not beſore, it acquires it uprF on the ſame account, upon which other Bodies have it, and it is but a conſequent to this Mechanical Change of Texture. that by means of ĩts Effects upon our Organs of Senſe, we are inducd to attribute this or that ſenſible Quality to it. Als in caſe a Pin ſhould chance by ſome inanimate Body to be driven agĩinſt a Man's Finger, that which thè Agent doth, is but to put à ſharp and ſlender Body into ſuch a kind. of Motion, and that which the Pin doth, is to pierce into a Body that it meets with, not hard enough to reſiſt its Motion, and ſo that upon this there ſhould enſue ſuch a thing as Pain, is but a Conſequent, that ſuperadds nothing of Real to the Pin thut occaſions that Pain. 5o ifa piece of Tranſparent Ice be, by the falling of ſome heavy and hard Body upon it, broen into a Groſs Powder that looks W hitiſh, the falling Body doth nothing to the Ice but break it into very ſmall Fragments, lying confuſedly upon one another; though by reaſon of the Fabrick of the World, and of our Eyes, there doth in the day time upon this Comminution, enſue ſuch a kind of copious Reſlection of the incident Light to our Eyes, as we call Whiteneſſe: and when the Sun, by thawing this broken Ice, deſtroyes the Whiteneſs of that portion of Matter, and makes it become Diaphanous, which it was not before, it doth no more then alter the Texture of the Component parts, by putting them into Motion, and thereby into a new Order; in which, by reaſon of the diſpoſition of the Pores intercepted betwixt them, they reſlect but few of the incident beams of Light, and tranſmit moſt of them. Thus when with a Burniſher You poliſh a rough piece of Silver, that which is really done, is but the Depreſſion of the little Protuberant parts into one Level with the reſt of the Superſicies; though upon this Mechanical change of the Texture of the Superſicial parts, we Men ſay, that ĩt hath loſt the Quality of Roughneſs, and acquir'd that of Smoothneſs, becauſe that whereas before, the little Exſtancies by their Figure reſiſted a little the Motion of our Finger, and grated upon them a little, our Fingers now meet with no ſuch offenſive Reſiſtance. Tis true that the Fire doth thaw Ice, and alſo both make Wax flow, and enable it to burn a Man's hand, and yet this doth not neceſſarily argue in it any Inhærent Quality of Heat, diſtinct from the Power it hath of putting the ſmall parts of the Wax into ſuch a Motion, as that their Agitation ſurmounts their Cohæſion,; which Motion, together with their Gravity, is enough to make them pro tempore conſtitute a Fluid Body: and Aqua Fortis, without any ( ſenſibley Heat, will make Camphire, caſt onit, aſſume the form of a Liquor diſtinct from it; as I have try'd, that a ſirong Fire will olſo make Camphie fluid: not to adde, that Iknow a Liquor, into which certain Bodies being putwhen both it Self, ſ(as well as They,) is actually cold, (and conſequently when You would not ſuſpect it of an Actual Inhærent Heat) will not onely ſpeedily diſſipate many of their parts into Smoalc, but leave the reſt Black, and burnt almoſt like a Coal. So that though we ſuppoſe the Fire to do no more then variouſly and briskly to agitate the Inſenſible parts of the Wax, That may ſuffice to make us think the Wax endow'd with a Quality of Heat: becauſe if ſuch an Agitation be greater then that of the Spirit, and other parts of our Organs of Touching, That is enough to produce in us that Senſation we call Heat; which is ſo much a Relative to the Senfory which apprehends it, that vve ſee, that the ſame Lukevvarm Water, that ĩs, vvhoſe Corpuſcles are moderately agitated by the Fire, will appear hot to one ofa Man's hands, it That be very cold; and cold to the other, n caſe it be very hõt, though both of them be the ſame Man's hands. To be ſort, it we fancy any two of the Bodies about us, as a Stone, a Mettal, &c. to have nothing at all to do with any other Body m the Univerſe, tis not eaſy to conceive, either how one can act upon the other, but by Local Motion (of the vhole Body, or its Corporeal Effluvia;) or how by Motion it can do any more, then put the Parts of the other Body into Motion too, and thereby produce in them a Change of Scituation and Texture, or of ſome other of its Mechanical Affections: though this (Paſſive) Body being placd among other Bodies in a World conſtituted as ours now is, and being brought to act upon the moſt curiouſly contrivd Senlſories of Animals, may upon both theſe accounts exhibit many differing ſenſible Phænomena, which however we look ſequently but the Effects of the oſten mentiond Catholick affections of Matter, and deducible from the Size, Shape, Motion (or Reſt,) Poſture, Order, and the reſulting Texture of the Inſenſible parts of Bodies. And therefore though, for ſhortneſs of ſpeech, Iſhall not ſcruple to make uſe of the word Qualities, ſince it is already ſo generally receiv'ò, yet I would be underſtood to mean them in a ſenſe ſuitable to the Doctrine above deliverd. As if I ſhould ſay, that Roughneſſe is apt to grate and offend the Skin, Iſhould mean, that a File or other Body, by having upon its Surface a multitude of little hard and exſtant Parts, and of an Angular or ſharp Tigure, is qualifyd to work the mention'd Effect: and ſo if I ſould ſay, that Heat melts Mettals, Iſhould mean, that this Fuſion is effected by Fire, or ſome other Body, which by the various and vehement Motion of ĩts inſenſible parts, (by the way,) I preſume You will eaſily gueſs at what Ithink of the Controverſy ſo hotly diſputed of late betwixt two parties of Learned Men, whereot the One would have all Accidents to worke onely in virtue of the Matter they reſide in, and the Other would have the Matter to act onely in virtue of its Accidents: for conſidering, that on the one ſide, the Qualities, we here ſpeak of, do ſo depend upon Matter, that they cannot ſo much as have a Be. ing but in, and by it; and on the other ſide, ifall Matter were but quite devoid of Motion, (to name now no other Accidents,) I do not readily conceive, how it could operate at all, Ithinkit is ſafeſt to conclude, That neither Matter, nor Qualities apart, but both oĩ them conjointly do perform, what we ſee done by Bodies to one another, according to the Doctrine of Qualities juſt now deliverd. Cofihe Nature of a Forme.) VII. vV E may now advance ſomewhat farther, and conſider, that Men having taken notice, that certain conſpicuous Accidents were to be found aſſociated in ſome Bodies, and other Conventions of Accidents in other Bodies, thev did for conveniency, and for the more expeditious Expreſſion of their Conceptions agree to diſtinguiſh them into ſeveral Sorts, which they call Genders or Species, according as they referrd them either upwards to a more Comprehenſive ſort of Bodies, or downward to a narrower Species, or to Individuals: As, obſerving many Bodies to agree in being Fuſible, Malleable, Heavy, and the like, they gave to that ſort of Body the name of Mettal, which is a Genus in reference to Gold, Silver, Lead, and but a Species in reference to that ſort of mixt Bodies they call Foſtilia. This ſuperior Genus como prehending both Mettals, Stones, and diverſe other Concretions, though it ſelf be but a Species in reſpect of Mixt Bodies. Now when any Body is referrd to any particular 5pecies, (as of a Mettal, a Stone, or the like,) becauſe Men have for their Convenience agreed to ſigniſie all the Eſſentials requiſite to conſtitute ſuch a Body by one Name, moſt of the Writers of Phyſicks have been apt to think, that beſides the common Matter of all Bodies, there is but One thing that diſcriminates it from other Kinds, and makes it what it is, and this for brevities ſake they call a Forme; which, becauſe all the Qualities and other Accidents of the Body muſt dependon it, they alſo imagine to be æ very Subſtance, and indeed a kind of Soule, which united to the groſs Matter compoſes with it a Natural Body, and acts in it by the ſeveral Qualities to be found therein, which Men are wont to aſcribe to the Creature ſo compoſtd, But as to this affair, I obſerve, that if (tor Inſtance) You ask a Man, what Gold is, if he cannot ſhew you a piece of Gold, and tell You, This is Gold, he will deſcribe i' to You as a Body, that is extremely Ponderous, very Mal. leable and Ductile, Fuſible and yet Fixt in the Fire, and or a Yellowiſh colour: and if You offer to put off to him a piece of Braſs for a piece of Gold, he will preſently refuſe it, and (i he underſtand Mettals) tell You, that though Your Braſs be coloured like it, 'tis not ſo heavy, nor ſo malleable, neſther will it like Gold reſiſt. the utmoſt brunt of the Fire, or reſiſt Aqua Fortis: and if You ask Men what they mean by a Ruby, or Niter, or a Pearl, they will ſtill make You ſuch Anſwers, that You may clearly perceive, that whatever Men talk in Theory of Subſtantial Forms, yet That, upon whoſe account they really diſtinguiſh any one Body from others, and referit to this or that Species of Bodies, is nothing but. an Aggregate or Convention of ſuch Accidents, as moſt men do by a kind of Agreement (for the Thing is more Arbitrary then we are aware of) think neceſſary or ſufficient to make a Portĩon of the Univerſal Matter belong to. this or that Determinate Genus or Species of Natural Bodies. And therefore not onely the Generality of Chymiſts, but diverſe Philoſophers, and, what is more, ſome Schoolmen themſelves, maintain it to be poſſible to Tranſmute the ignobler Mettals into Gold; which argues, that if a Man could bring any Parcel of Matter to be Yellow, and Malleable, and Ponderous, and Fixt in the Fire, and upon the Teſt, and Indiſſoluble in 4qua Fortis, and in ſome to have a concurrence of all thoſe Accidents, by which Men try True Gold from Falſe, they would take it for True Gold without ty of Mankind would leave the SchoolDoctors to diſpute, whether being a Factitious Body, ſas made by the Chymiſts art,) it have the Subſtantial Form of Gold, and would upon the account of the Convention of the freſhly menti. ond Accidents let it paſs Current amongſt them, notwithſtanding moſt Mens greater care, not to be deceived in a matter of this nature then in 2ny other. And indeed, ſince to every Determinate Species of Bodies, there doth belong more then One Quulity, and for the moſt part a concurrence o? Many is ſo Eſſential to That ſort of Bodies, that the want of any of them is ſufficient to exclude it from belonging to that species: there needs no more to diſcriminate ſufficiently any One kind o? Bodies from all the Bodies in the World, that are not of that kind; as the Chy miſts Luna fixa, which they tell us wants not the Weight, the Malleableneſſe, nor the Fixtneſs, nor any other property of Gold, except the Yellowneſſe, (which makes them call it White Golẽ would by reaſon of that want of Colour be eaſily known from true Gold. And you will not wonder at this, if you conſider, that thoſe Sphæres and Parallelopipedons differ but in Shape, vet this difterence alone is the ground of ſo many others, that Euclid and other Geometricians have demonſtrated, I know not how manv Properties of the one, which do no way belong to the other, andt 4riſtotle himſelf ſomewhere tels us, That a Sphære is compoſd of Braſs and Roundneſs. And I ſuppoſe it would be thought a Mans own fault, if he could not diſtinguiſh a Needle from a File, or a Key from a pair of Sciſſors, though theſe being all made of Iron, and differing but in Bigneſſe and Shape, are leſs remarkably diverſe then Natural Bodies, the moſt part of which differ from each other in far more Accidents T Auſt. Metagh. lib,7. cap. S. then Two. Nor need we think that Qualities being but Accidents, they cannot be eſential toa Natural Body; for Accident, as I formerly noted, is ſometimes oppoſd to Subſtance, and ſometimes to Eſſence: and though an Accident can be but accidental to Matter, as it is a Subſtantial thing, yet it may be eſſential to this or that particular Body, as in Ariſtotle's newly mention'd Example, though Rouncneſò is but Accidental to Braſs, yettis Eſſential to a Braſen Sphære; becauſe, though the Braſſe were devoid of Roundneſſe, (as if it were Cubical, or of any orher figure,) it would ſtill be a Corporeal Subſtance, yet without that Roundneſs it could not be a Sphære: wherefore ſince an Aggregate or Convention of Qualities is enough to make the portion of Mattertis found in, what it is, and denominate it of this or that Determinate ſort of Bodies; and ſince thoſe Qualities, as we have ſeen already, do themſelves proceed from thoſe more Primary and Catholick affections of Matter, Bulk, Shape, Motion or Reſt, and the Texture thence reſulting, why may we not ſay, that the Form of a Body being made up of thoſe Qualities united in one Subject, doth likewiſe conſiſt in ſuch a Convention of thoſe newly namd Mechanical Affections of Matter, as is neceſſary to conſtitute a Body of that Determinate kind. And ſo, though I ſhall tor brevities ſake retain the word Forme, yet I would be underſtood to mean by it, not a Real Subſtance diſtinct from Matter, but onely the Matter it ſelf of a Natural Body, conſider'd with its peculiar manner of Exiſtence, which Ithink may not inconveniently be call/d either its Specifical or its Denominating State, or its Eſſential Modification, or, if you would have me expreſs it in one word, its Stamp: ſor ſuch a Convention of Accidents is ſuſficient to perform the Offil ces that are neceſſarily requir'd in what Men call a Forme, ſince it makes the Body ſuch as it is, making it appertain to this or that Determinate Species of Bodies, and diſcriminating it from all other Species of Bodies whatſoever: as for Inſtance, Ponderouſneſs, Ductility, Fixtneſſe, Yellowneſs, and ſome other Qualities, concurring in a portion oſ Matter, do with it conſtitute Gold, and making it belong to that Species we call Mettals, and to that ſort of Mettals we call Gold, do hoth denominate and diſcriminate it from Stones, Salts, Marchaſites, and all other ſorts of Bodies that are not Mettals, and from Silver, Braſs, Copper, and all Mettals except Gold. And whereastis ſaid by ſome, that the Forme alſo of a Body ought to be the Principle of its Operations, we ſhall hereafter conſider in what ſenſe That is to be admitted or rejected; in the mean time it may ſuſfice us, that even in the Vulgar Philoſophy tis acknowG ledg⸗d, that Natural Things for themoſt part operate by their Qualities, as Snow dazles the Eyes by its Whiteneſs, and Water ſcatter'd into drops of Rain falis from the Clouds upon the account of its Gravity. To which Iſhall adde, that how great the power may be, which a Body may exerciſe by virtue ofa ſingle Quality, may appear by the Various and oftentimes Prodigious Effects, which Fire produces by its Heat, when thereby it melts Mettals, calcines Stones, deſtroves whole Woods and Cities &c: And if ſeveral Active Qualities convene in one Body, (as that which in our Hypotheſis is meant by Forme, uſually compriſes ſeveral of them,) what great things may be thereby performd, may be ſomewhat gueſs'd at by the ſtrange things we ſee done by ſome Engines which, being, as Engins, undoubtedly &void of Subſtantial Forms, muſt do thoſe ſtrange things they are admird for, by virtue of thoſe Accidents, the Shape, Size, Motion, and Contrivance, of their parts. Not to mention, that in our Hypotheſis, beſides thoſe Operations that proceed from the Eſſential Modification of the Matter, as the Body (compoſ4 of Matter and neceſſary Accidents) is conſiderd per modum unini, as one Entire Corporeal Agent, it may in diverſe caſes have other Operations, upon the account of thoſe particular Corpuſcles, which though they concurre to compoſe it, and are in reference to the whole conſiderd but as its parts, may yet retain their own particular Nature, and diverſe of the peculiar Qualities: as in a Watch, beſides thoſe things which the Watch performs as ſuch, the ſeveral parts whereof It conſiſts, as the Spring, the Wheels, the String, the Pins, &c. may have each of them its peculiar Bulk, Shape, and other Attributes, upon the account of one or more of which, the Wheel or Spring &c. may do other things then what it doth, as meerly a Conſtituent part of the Watch. And ſo in the Milk of a Nurſe, that hath ſome hours before takena Pòtion, though the Corpuſcles of the purging Medicine appear not to ſenſe diſtinct fromthe other parts of the Mills, which in far greater numbers concurre with them, to conſtitute that white Liquor, yet theſe Purgative Particles, that ſeem but to be part of the Matter u hereoſ the Milk conſiſts, do yet ſoretain their own Nature and Qualities, that being ſuck'd in with the reſt by the Infant, they quickly diſcriminate and diſcover them ſelves by purging him. But oſ this Subject more hereatter. ſOf Generation, Corruption, and Alteration.) VIII I' now remains that we declare, what, according to the Tenour of our Hypotheſis, is to be meant by Generation, Corruption, and Alteration, CThreè Names, that have very much puzled and divided Philoſophers.) In order hereunto we may conſider, I. That there are in the World great ſtore of Particles of Matter, each of which is too ſmall to be, whilſt ſingle, Senſible; and being Entire, or Undivided, muſt needs both have its Determinate Shape, and be very Solid. Inſomuch, that though it be mentally,and by Divine Omnipotence diviſible, yet by reaſon of its Smalneſs and Solidity, Nature doth ſcarce ever actually divide it; and theſe may in this ſenſe be call'd M⸗. nima or Prima Naturalia. 2. That there are alſo Multitudes of Corpuſcles, which are made up of the Coalition of ſeveral of the former Minima Naturalia; and whoſe Bulk is ſo ſmall, and their Adhæſion ſo cloſe and ſtrict, that each of theſe little Primitive Concretions or Cluſters it I may ſo call them) of Particles is ſingly below the diſcernment of Senſe, and though not abſolutely indiviſible bYy Nature into the Prima Naturalia that compoſd it, or perhaps into other little Fragments, yet, for the reaſons freſhly intimated, they very rarely happen to be actually diſſolv'd or broken, but remain entire in great variety of ſenſible Bodies, and under various lorms or diſguiſes. As, not to repeat, what we lately mentiond, of the undeſtroyd purging Corpuſcles of Milk; we ſee, that even Groſſer and more compounded Corpuſcles may have ſuch a permanent Texture: For Quickſilver, for inſtance, may be turnd into a red Powder for a Fuſible and Malleable Body, or a Fugitive Smoa, and diſguiſd I know not how many other wayes, and yet remain true and recoverable Mercury. And theſe are as It were the Seeds, or immediate Princiæ ples of many ſorts of Natural Bodies, as Earth, Water, Salt, &c. and thoſe ſingly inſenſible, become capable, when united, to aftect the Senſe: as I have tryd, that if good Camphire be kept a while in pure Spirit of Wine, it will thereby be- reduc'd into ſuch Little parts, as totally to diſappear in the Liquor, without making it look leſs clear then fair Water, and yet, if into this Mixture you pour a competent quantity of Water, in a moment the ſcatter'd Corpuſcles of the Camphire will, by re. uniting themſelves, become White, and conſequently Viſible, as before their Diſperſion. 3. That as well each of the Minima Naturalia, as each of the Primary Cluſters above mention'd, having its own Determinate Bulk & Shape, when theſe come to adhere to one another, it muſt almaies happen, that the Size, and often, that the Figure of the Corpuſcle compol d by their Juxta- poſition æand Cohæſion, will be chang'd: and not ſeldome too, the Motion either of the one, or the other, or both, will receive a new Tendency, or be alterd as to its Velocity, or otherwiſe. And the like ill hap⸗ pen, when the Corpuſcles, that compoſe a Cluſter of Particles, are disjoyn'd, or any thing of the little Maſs is broken off. And whether any thing of Matter be added to a Corpuſcle, or taken from it in either caſe, (as we juſt now intimated,) the Size ofit muſt neceſſarily be alter’d, and for the moſt part the Figure will be ſo too, wherebv it will both acquire a Congruity to the Pores of ſome Bodies, ſand perhaps ſome oſ our Senſories,) and become Incongruous to thoſe of others, and conſequently be qualify'd, as I ſhall more fully ſhew you hereafter, to operate on diverſe occaſions, much otherwiſe then it was ſitted to do before. 4. That when many of theſe inſenſible Corpuſcles come to be aſſociated into one viſible Budy, if many or moſt of them be put into Motion, from what cauſe ſoever the Motion proceeds, That it ſelf may produce great Changes, and new Qualities in the Body they compoſe, for not onely Motion may perform much, even when it makes not any viſible Alteration init, as Air put into ſwift Motion, (as when it is blown out of Bellows) acquires a new Name, and is call'd Wind, and to the Touch appears far colder then the ſame 4ir not ſo form'd into a Stream: and Iron, by being briskly rubbd again Wood or other Iron, hath its ſmall parts ſo agitated, as to appear hot to our Senſe: but this Motion oftentimes makes viſible Alterations in the Texture of the Body into which it is receivd, for alwaies the Moved parts ſtrive to communicate their Motion, or ſomewhat of the degree ofit, to ſome parts that were before either at Reſt, or otherwiſe movſũ, and oftentimes the ſame Movd parts do thereby either disjoyn, or break ſome of the Corpuſcles they hit againſt, and thereby change their Bullk, or Shape, or both, and. either drive fom: ofthem quite out of the Body, and perhaps lodge themſelves in their places, or elſe aſſociate them anew with others. Whence it uſually follows, that the Texture, is ſfor a while at leaſt, and, unleſſe it be very ſtable and permanent, for good and all, very much alter' d, and eſpecially, in that the Pores or little Intervals intercepted betwixt the component Particles, will be chang'd as to Bigneſs, or Figure, or both, and ſo will ceaſe to be commenſurate to the Corpuſcles that were fit for them before, and become commenſurate to ſuch Corpuſcles of other Sizes and Shapes, as till then were incongruous to them. Thus we ſee that Water, by looſing the wonted agitation of its parts, may acquire the Firmneſſe and Brittleneſſe we find in Ice, and looſe much of the Tranſparency it had whilſt it was a Liquor. Thus alſo by very hard rubbing two pieces of Reſinous Wood againſt one another, we may make them throw out diverſe of their looſer parts into Steæms and viſible Smoa, and may, if the Attrition be duely continueq, make that commotion of the parts ſo change the Texture of the whole, as aſterwards to turn the ſuperficial parts into a kind of Coal. And thus Milk, eſpecially in hot weather, will by the inteſtine ,though languid, Motions of its parts, be in a ſort time turnd into a thinner ſort of liquor then Milk, and into Cream, and this (laſt nam ꝗ will by being barely agitated in a Churn, be turnd in a ſhorter time into that Unctuous and conſiſtent Body we call Butter, and into thin, fluid, and ſower Butter- milk. And thus (to diſpatch ) by the bruiſing of Fruit, the Texture is commonly ſò chang°d, that as we ſee particularly in Apples, that the Bruiſd part ſoon comes to be of another nature then the Sound part, the one diſfering from the other both in Colour, Taſt, Smell, and Conſiſtence. So that ( as we have alreãdy inculcated) Local Motion hath, of all other aſfections of Matter, the greateſt Intereſt in the Altering and Modifying ofit, ſince it is not onely the Grand Agent or Efficient among Second C auſes, but is alſo oſtentimes one of the principal things that conſtitutes the Forme of Bodies: as when two Sticks are ſet on fire by long and vehement Attrition, Local Motion is not onely that which indſes the Wood, and ſo as an Efficient produces the Fire, but is That which principally concurrs to give the produced Stream of ſhining Matter, the name and nature of Flame: and ſo it concurrs alſo to conſtitute all Fluid Bodies. 5. And that ſince we have formerly ſeen, thattis from the Size, Shape, and Motion of the ſmall parts of Matter, and the Texture that reſults from the manner of their being diſpoſd in any one Body, that the Colour, Odour, Taſt, and other qualities of that Body are to be deriv'd, it will be eaſie for is to recollect, That ſuch Changes cannot happen in a portion of Matter, without ſo much varying the Nature of it, that we need not deride the antient Atomiſts, for attempting to deduce the Generation and Corruption of Bodies from the famd ſugi7i 5  u1015, the Convention and Diſſolution, and the Alterations of them, from the tranſpoſition of their (ſuppoſrd) Atoms: For though indeed Niture is wont in the Chunges ſhe males among things Corporeal, to implov all the rhree wayes, as well in Alterations, as Generations and Corruptions; vet if they onely meant, as probably enough they did, That of the three waies propoſd, the Firſt was wont to be the Principal in the Generation of Bodies, the ſecond in the Corruption, & the third in their Alterations, I ſhall not much oppoſe this Doctrine: though I take the Local Motion or Tranſpoſition of Parts, in the ſame portion of Matter, to bear a great ſtroak as well in reference to Generation and Corruption, as to Alteratiom: as we ſee when Milk, or Fleſh, or Fruit, without any remarkable addition or loſs of parts turns into Maggots, or other Inſects; and as we may more conſpicuouſly obſerve in the Præ. cipitation of Mercury without addition, in the Vitrification of Mettals, and other Chymical Experiments to be hereaſter mentiond. Theſe things premiſd, it will not now be difficult to compriſe in few words ſuch a Doctrine, touching the Generation, Corruption, and Alteration of Bodies, as is ſuitable to our Aypotheſis, and the former Diſcourſe. For if in a parcel of Matter there happen to be producd ſit imports not much how) a Concurrence oſ all thoſe Accidents, vhether thoſe onely, or more) that Men by tacite agreement have thought neceſſary and ſufficient to conſtiture any one Determinate Species of things corporeal, longing to that Species, as ſuppoſe a Stone, or àa Mettal, is Generated, or produc'd de novo. Not that there is really any thing of Subſtantial producd, but that thoſe parts of Matter, that did indeed before præexiſt, but were either ſcatterd and ſhord among other Bodies, or at leaſt otherwiſe diſpoſd of, are now brought together, and diſpoſ4d of after the manner requiſite, to entitle the Body that reſults from them to a new Denomination, and make it appertain to ſuch a Determinate Species of Natural Bodies, ſo that no new subſtance is in Generation produc'àa, but onely That, which was præexiſtent, obteins a newm Modification, or manner o Exiſtence. Thus when the Spring, and Wheels, and String, and Balance, and Index &c. neceſſary to a Watch, which lay before ſcatter'd, ſome in one part, ſome in another of the Artificers Shop, are firſt ſet together in the Order requiſite to make ſuch an Enginc, to ſhew how the time paſſes, 2 watch ĩs ſaid to be made: not that any of the mentiond Material parts is produc'd de novo, but that till then the divided Matter was not ſo contrid and put together, as was requiſite to conſtitute ſuch a thing, as we call a Watch. And ſo when Sand and Aſhes are well melted together, and Iufferd to cool, there is Generated by the Colliquation that ſort of Concretiou we call Glaſſ, though it be evident, that its Ingredients were both præexiſtent, and do but by their Aſſociation obtain a New manner ofexiſting together. And ſo when by the Churning of Creame, Butter and Butter- mill are generated, we find not any thing Subſtantial Producd de novo in either of them, but onely that the serum, and the fat Corpuſcles, being put into Local Motion, do by their frequent Occurſions extricate themſelves from each other, and aſſociate themſelves in the new manner, requiſitę to conſtitite the Bodies, whoſe names are given them. And as a Body is ſuid to be generated, when it firſt appears clothed with all thoſe Qualities, upon hoſe Account Men have been pleaſd to call ſome Bodies Stones; others, Mettals; others, Salis, &c. ſo when a Body comes to looſe all or any of thoſe Accidents that are Eſſential, and neceſſary to the conſtituting of ſuch a Body, it is then ſaid to be corruptea or deſtroyd, and is no more a Body of that Xind, but looſes jts Title to its former Denomination. Not that any thing Corporeal or Sub. ſtantial periſhes in this Change, but onely that the Eſſential Modiſication of the Matter is deſtroy'd: and though the Body be ſtilla Body, ſno Natural Agent being able to aunihilate Matter,) yet 'tis no longer ſuch a BOdy, as twas before, but periſheth in the capacity of a Body of that Kind. Thus if a Stone, falling upona Watch, brèa it to pieces; a1, when the Watch was made therẽ was no new Subſtance producd, all the Material parts (as the Steel, Braſs, String, &c.) being præexiſtent ſome where or other, (as in Iron, and CopperMines, in the Bellies of thoſe Animals, of whoſe Guts Men uſe to make Strings;) ſo not the Ieaſt part of the Subſtance o? the Watch is Ioſt, but onely diſplac'd and ſcatter'd; and yet that Portion of Matter ceaſes to be a VVateh as it was beforee. And ſo (to reſume our late Example)when Creame is by Churning turn'd into Butter, and a Serous Liquor, the parts of the Mill remain aſſociated intorhoſe two Bodies, but the White Liquor periſheth in the capacity oſ Milk, And ſo when Ice comes to be thawd in exactly cloſd Veſſels, though the Corruption be producd onely (for ought appears) by introducing a new Motion and Diſpoſition into the parts of the Frozen Water, yet it thereupon ceaſes to be Ire, howeli ver it be as much ?Pater, ãnd conſequently as much a Body, as before it was frozen or thaw'dc Theſe and the like Examples may teach us rightly to underſtand that common Axiom of Naturaliſts, Corruptio unius eſt generatio alterius;s & è contrà: for ſince it is acknowledged on all hands, that Matter cannot be annihilated, and ſince it appears by what we have ſaid above, that there are ſome Properties, namely Siæe, Shape, Motion, (or in its abſence, Reſt,) that are inſeparable fromthe actual parts of Matter; and ſince alſo the Coalition of any competent number of theſe parts is ſufficient to conſtitute a Natural Body, endowd with diverſe ſenſible Qualities; it can ſcàrce be otherwiſe, but that the ſame Agents, thãt ſhatter the Erame, or destroy the Texture of one Body, will by ſhuſfling them together, and diſpoſing them aftera New manner, bring them to conſtitute ſome nev ſort of Bodies: As the ſame thing, that by burning deſtroyes Wood, turns it into Flame, Soot, and Aſhes. Onely Idoubt, whether the Axiome do generally hold true, if it be meant, That every Corruption muſt end in the Generation of a Body, belonging to ſome particular Species of things, unleſſe we take Powders and fluid Bodies indeſinitely for species of Natural Bodies; ſince it is plain, there are multitudes of Vegetables, and other Concretions, which, when they rot, do not, as ſome others do, turn into Worms, but either into ſome ſlimy or watery Subſtance, or elſe (wWhich is the moſt uſuall) they crumble into a kind of Duſt or Powder, which, though lookd upon às being the Earth, into which rotten Bodies are at length reſolvd, is very far fiom being of an Elementary nature, but as yet 2 Compounded Body, retaining ſome, if not many, ualities, which often makes the Duſt of one ſort of Plant or Animal differ much from that of another. And This will ſupply me with this Argument 44 hominem, viz. That ſince int hoſe violent Corruptions of Bodies, that are made by Outward Agents, ſhattering them into pieces, if the Axiome hold true, the New Bodies emergent upon the Diſſolution of the Former, muſt be really Natural Bodies, as (indeed divers of the Moderns hold them to be,) and Generated according to the courſe of Nature, as when Wood is deſtroyd by Fire, and turnd partly into Flame, partly into Soot, partly into Coals, and partly into Aſhes; I hope we may be allowd to conclude, That thoſe Chymical Production:, which ſo manv would have to be but Facbitious Bodies, are Natural ones, and regularly Generated. For it being the ſame Agent, the Fire, that operates upon Bodies, whether they be expoſd toit in cloſe Glaſſes, or in Chimnies, I ſee no ſufficient reaſon, why the Chymical Oyls, and Volatile Salts, and other things which Spagirites obtain from mixt Bodies, ſhould not be accounted Natural Bodies, as well as the Soot, and Aſhes, and Charcoal, that by the ſame fire are obtaind from Kindled Wood. But before we paſſe away from the mention of the Corruption of Bodies, I muſt take ſome notice of what is call'd their putrefaction. This is but a Peculiar kiud of Corruption, wrought ſlowly (whereby it may be diſtinguiſh'd frodd Deſtruction by Fire, and other nimble Agents) in ſlodies: it happens to them for the moſt part by means of the Air, or ſome other Ambient Fluid, which by penetrating into the Pores of the Bodv, and by its agitation in them, doth uſually call out ſome of the more Agile and leſſe entangled parts of the Body, and doth almoſt ever looſen and diſlocate the parts in general, and thereby ſo change the Texture, and perhaps too the Figure, of the Corpuſcles, that compoſe it, that the Body, thus changd, acquires Qualities unſuitable to its Former Nature, and for the moſt port offenſive to Our Senſes, eſpecially of Smelling and Taſting: which laſt clauſe Itherefore adde, not onely becauſe the Vulgar lool not upon the Change of an Egge into a Chick as a Corruption, but as a Perfection of the Egge; but becauſe alſo I think it not ſmprobable, that ifby ſuch ſ=low Ghanges of Bodies, as make them Iooſe their former Nature, and might otherwiſe paſſe for Pu. trefaction, many Bodies ſhould acquire better Sents or Taſts then before; or if Nature, Cuſtom, or any other cauſe ſhould much alter the Texture of our Orgãns of Taſting and Smelling, it would not perhaps be ſo well agreed on what ſhould be call'd Putrefaction, s that imports an impairing Alteration, but Men would find ſome favourabler Notion for ſuch Changes. For I obſerve, that Medlars, though they acquire in length of time ſuch a Colour and Softneſs as rotten Apples, and other putrify'd Fruits do, yet, becauſe their Taſt is not then harſh as before, we call that Ripeneſs in them, which otherwiſe we ſhould call Rottenneſ. And though upon the Death of a fourfooted Beaſt, we generally call that Change, which happens to the Fleſh or Bloud, Putrefaction, yet we paſſe a more favourable judgment upon That, which happens to the Fleſh and other ſofter parts of that Animal, (whether it be a kind of large Rabbets, or very ſmall and hornleſſe Deer,) of which in China, and in the Levant they make Muſk; becauſe by the Change, that enſues the Animals death, the Fleſh acquires not an odious, but a grateful Smell. And we ſee, that ſome Men, whoſe Appetites are gratified by Rotten Cheeſe, think it Then not to have degenerated, but to have attaind its beſt State, when haviug loſt its former Colour, Smell, and Taſt, and, which is more, being in great part turnd into thoſe Inſects calld Mites, tis both in a Philoſophical ſenſe corrupted, and in the æſtimate of the generality of Men grown Putrid, But becauſe it very ſeldom happens, that a Body by Generation acquires no other Qualities, then juſt thoſe that are abſolutely neceſſary, to make it belong to the Species that Denominates it; therefore in moſt Bodies there are diverſe other Qualities that may be there, or may be miſſing, without Eſſentially changing the Subject: as Water may be clear or muddy, odorous or ſtinking, and ſtill remain Water; and Butter may be white or yellow, ſweet or rancid, conſi. ſtent or melted, and ſtill be call’d Butter. Now therefore whenſoever a Parcel of Matter does acquire or looſe a Quality, that is not Eſſential to it, That Acquiſition or Loſſe is diſtinctly call'd Alteration, (or by ſome, Mutation:) the Acquiſt onely of the Qualities that are abſolutely neceſſary to conſtitute its EſE ſential and Specifical diſference, or the Loſs ofary of thoſe Qualities, being ſuch a Change as muſt not be callã meer Alteration, but have the porticular name of Generation or Corruption; both which according to this Doctrine appear to be but ſeveral Xinds of Alteration, taken in a large ſenſe, though they are diſtinguiſh'd from it ina more ſtrict and Limited acception of that Terme. And here we have a fair Occaſion to take notice of the Fruitfulneſſe and Extent of our Mechanical Hypotheſis: For ſince according to our Doctrine, the World we live in is not a Moveleſſe or Indigeſted Maſs oſ Matter, but an Avrbuaros, OF Selſ moving Engine, wherein the oreateſt part of the common Matter of all Bodies is alwaies (though not ſtill the ſame parts of it) in Motion, & wherein Bodies are ſo cloſe ſet by one another, that (unleſſe in ſome very few ternatural caſes) they have either noò Vacuities betwixt them, or onely here and there interpos'd, and very ſmall ones. Aud ſince, according to us, the various manner of the Coalition of ſeveral Corpuſcles into one viſible Body is enough to give them a peculiar Texture, and thereby fitt th'm to exhibit divers ſenſible Qualities, and to become a Body, ſometimes of one Denomination, and ſometimes of another; it will very naturally follow, that from the various Occurſionsofthoſe innumerable ſwarms of little Bodies, that are mov'd to and fro in the World, there will be many fitted to ſtick to one another, and ſo compoſe Concretions; and many (though not inthe ſelf ſame place) diſjoyn'd from one another, and agitated apart; and multitudes alſo that ill be driven to aſſociate themſelves, now with one Body, and preſently with another. And if e alſo conſider on the one ſide, that the Sizes of the ſmall Particles of  Moatter Matter may be very various, their Figures almoſt innumerable, and that if a parcel of Matter do but happen to ſtick to one Body, it may chance to give it a new Qualitv, and if it adhere to another, or hit againſt ſome of its Parts, it may conſtitute a Body ofænother Kind; or if a parcel of Matter be knockt off from another, it may barely by That, leave It, and become it ſelf of another Nature then before If, I ſay, we conſider theſe things on the one ſide; and on the other ſide, that (to uſe Lucretius his Compariſon) all that innumerable multitude of Words, that are containd in all the Languages of the World, are made of the various Combinations of ſome of the 24 Letters of the Alpha. bet;twill not be hard to conceive, that there may be an incomprehenſi ble variety of Aſſociations and Textures of the Minute parts of Bodies, and conſequently a vaſt Multitude o? Portions of Matis: endowd with ſtore enough of differing Qualities, to deſerve diſtinct Appellations, though for want of heedfulneſſe and fit Words, Men have not yet talen ſo much notice of their leſſe obvious Varieties, as to ſort them as they deſerve, and give them diſtinct and proper Names. SO that rhough I would not ſay, that Any thing can immediately be made of Every thing, as a Gold Ring of a 77edęe of Gold, or Oyl, or Fire of Water, yet ſince Bodies, having but one common Matter, can be differend but by Accidents, which ſeem all of them to be the Effects and Conſequents o Local Motion, I ſee not, why it ſhould be abſurd to think, that (at leaſt among Inanimate Bodies) by the Intervention of ſome very ſmall Addition or Subſtraction of Matter, (which yet in moſt caſes will ſcarce be needed,) and of an orderly Seràies of Alterations, diſpoſing by degrees the Matter to be tranſmuted, almoſt of any thing, may at length be made Any thing: as, though out of a eãęe of Gold one cannot immediately make a Ring, yvet by. either Wyre: drawing that Wedqdge by degrees, or by melting it, and caſting a little of it into a Mould, That thing may eaſily be effected. And ſo though Water cannot immediately be tranſmuted into Oyl, and much leſs into Fire, yet if you nouriſh certain Plants with Water alone, (as I have done,) till they have aſſimilated a great quantity oſ Water into their own Nature, You may, by committing this Tranſmuted Water (hich you may diſtinguiſh and ſeparate from that part of the Vegetable you firſt put in) to Diſtillation in convenient Glaſſes, obtain, beſides other things, a true Oyl, and a black combuſtible Coal, (and conſequently Fire,) both of which may be ſo copious, as to leave no)uſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that they could be any thing neer afforded by any little Spirituous parts, which may be præ ſumd to have been communicat ed by that part ofthe Vegetable, that is firſt put into the water, to that far greater part oſ it, which was committed to Diſtillation. But, Pyrophilus, I perceive the Diſſiculty and Fruitfulneſſe of my Subject, have made me ſo much more prolix then Iintended, that it will not now be amiſs to Contract the Summary of our Hypotheſis, and give you the Main Points of it with little or no Illuſtration, and without particular Prooſs in a few wordss We teach then (but without peremptorily aſſerting it,) Firſt, That the Matter of all Natural Bodies is the Same, namely a Subſtance extended and impenetrable, 2. That all Bodies thus agreeing in the ſame common Matter, their Diſtinction is to be taken from thoſe Accidents that do diverſiſy it. 3. That Motion, not belonging to the Eſſence of Matter, (which retains its whole Mature, whentis at Reſt,) and not being Originally producible by other Accidents, as They are from It, may be look'd upon as the Firſt and chief &uood or Affection of Matter. 4. That Motion, variouſly determin'd, doth naturally divide the Matter it belongs to, into actual Tragments or Parts; and this Diviſion obvious Experience, ſand more eminently, Chymical Operations) manifeſt to have been made into parts exceedingly minute, and very oſten, too minute to be ſingly perceiveable by our Senſes. 5. Whence it muſt neceſſarily follow, that each of theſe Minute Parts, or minima Naturalia (as well as every particular Body, made up by the Coalition of any number of them,) muſt have its Determinate Bigneſſe or Siæe, and its own Shape. And theſe three, namely Bull, Figure, and either Motion or Reſt, (there being no Mean between theſe two) are the three Primary and the inſenſible parts of Matter, conſiderd each of them apart. 6. That when diverſe of them are conſiderd together, there will neceſſarily follow here Below both a certain Poſition or Poſture in reference to the Horizon ſ(as Erected, Inclining, or Level) of each of them, and a certain Order, or placing before, or behind, or beſides one another; (as when in a company of Souldiers, one ftands upright, the other ſtoops, the other lyes along upon the Ground, they have various Poſtures; and their being placd beſides one another in Ranks, and behind one another in Files, are Varieties of their order?) and When many of theſe ſmall parts are brought to Convene into one Body from their pri mary Affections, and their Diſpoſition, or Contrivance as to Poſture and order, there reſults That, which by one Comprehenſive Name we call the Texture of that Body. And indeed theſe ſeveral Kinds of Location, to borrow a Scholaſtical Terme,) attributed ſin this 6 number) to the Minute Particles of Bodies, are ſo neer of Kinne, that they ſeem all of them referrable to (that One Event of their Convening,) Scituation, or Poſition-. And theſe are the Affections that belong to a Body, as it is conſider'd in it ſelf, without relation to ſenſitive Beings, or to other Natural Bodies. 7. Thut yet, there being Men in the World, whoſe Organs of Senſe are contriv'd in ſuch differing wayes, that one Senſory is fitted to receive Impreſſions from ſome, and another from other ſorts of External Objects, or Bodies without them, (Whether theſe act as Entire Bodies, or by Emiſion of their Corpuſcles, or by propagating ſome Motion to the Senſory,) the Perceptions of theſe Impreſſions are by men call’d by ſeveral Names, as Heat, Colour, Sound, Odour; and ate commonly imagind to proceed from certain ciſtinc and peculiar Qualities in the External Object, which have ſome reſemblance to the Idess, their action upon the Sen. ſes excites in the Mind; though indeed all theſe Senſible Qualities, and the reſt that are to be met with in the Bodies without us. are but the Effects or Conſequents of the above mentioned ꝓrimary Affections of Matter, whoſe Operations are diverſify’d according to the nature of the Senſories, or other Bodies they work upon. 8. That when a Portion of Matter, either by the acceſſion or Receſſe of Corpuſcles, or by the iranſpoſition of thoſe it conſiſted of before, or by any tmo or æll of theſe waies, happens to obtain a concurrence of all thoſe Qualities, which Men commonly agree to be neceſſary and ſufficient to Denominate the Body, which hath them, either a Mettal, ora Stone, or the like, and to rank it in any peculiar and determinate Species of Bodies, Then à Body of that DenominaIa tion is ſaid to be Generated. li g9. This Convention of Eſſential Accidents being talen (not any of them Apart, but all) rogether for the Speciſical Difference that conſtitutes the Body, and diſcriminates it from all other ſorts oP Bodies, is by one Mame, becauſe conſided as one collective Thing, call'd its Forme, (as Beauty, which is made up both of Symmetry of Parts, and Agreeableneſſe of Colours,) which is conſequently but a certain Character, (as I ſometimes call it,) or a peculiar ſtate of Matter, or, if Imay ſo name it, an Eſſential Modification: a Modification, becauſetis indeed but a Determinate manner of Exiſtence of the Matter, and vet an Eſſential Modification, becauſe that though the concurrent Quãlities be but Accidental to Matter, (which with others in ſtead of Them, would be Matter ſtill,) yet they are eſſentially neceſſary to the Particular Body, which without thoſe Accidents would not be a Body of that Denomination; as a Mettal or a Stone, but of ſ=ome other. 10. Now a Body being capable of many other Qualities, be ſides thoſe, whoſe Convention is neceſſary to make up its Form; the acquiſition or leſſe of any ſuch Quality is, by Naturaliſts in the more ſtrict ſenſe of that Terme, nam'd Alteration: as when Oyl comes to be frozen, or to change colour, or to grow rancid; but if all, or any of the Qualities, that are reputed ſſential to ſuch a Body, come to be lot or deſtroyd, that notable Change is call'd Corruption; as when Oyl being boyld takes fire, the Oyl is not ſaid to bè alter'd in the former ſenſe, but corrupted or deſtroyd, and the emergent Fire generated; and when it ſo happens, that the Body is ſlowly corrupted, and thereby alſo acquires Qualities offenſive to our Senſes, eſpecially of Smell and Taſt, (as when Tleſh, or Fruit grows rotten,) that kind of Corruption is by a more patticular Name call'd Putrefaction. But neither in this, nor in any other kind of Corruption is there any thing ſubſtantial deſtroy'd, (no ſuch thing having been producd in Generation, and Matter it ſelt being on all hands acknowledged incorruptible,? but onely that acial connexion of the Parts, Or manner of their Coexiſtence, upon whoſe account the Matter, whilſt it was in its former ſtate, was, and was call'd a Stone, or a Mettal, or did belong to any other and EXPERIMENTS, Touching the Origine of QU A LITIES and F OR M S. Turg HisTtorICAL PART. The I. SEcTiIoN, Containing the Obſervations. IN the foregoing Notes I have endeavoured with as much Clearneſs, as the Difficulty of the Subject, and the Brevity I was confined to, permitted to give a Scheme or Summary of the Principles of the, Corpuſcularian Philoſophy, as Iapprehended them, by way of a ſnort Introduction to it, at leaſt as far as I judged neceſſary for the better underſtanding of what is containd in our Notes and Experiments concerning the Productions and Changes of particular Qualities. But though, Ihope, Ihave not ſo affected Brevity, as to fall into Obſcurity, vet ſince theſe Principles are built upon the Phænomena of Nature, and deviſd in order to the Explillll cation of them, Iknow not what Ican do more proper to recommend them, then to ſubjoyn ſome ſuch Natural Phænomena, as either induce me to take up ſuch Notions, or which Ivas directed to find out by the Notions Ihad imbraccdc. And ſince Iappeale tothe Teſtimonv of Nature to verifie the Doctrine Ihave been propoſing, about the Origine and Production of Qualities, (for that of Formes will require a diſtinct Diſcourſe,) Ithink it very proper to ſet down ſome Obſervations of what Nature does, without being overrul'd by the Power and Skill of Man, as well as ſome Experiments wherein Nature is guided, and as it were Maſter'd by Art, thãt ſo ſhe may be made to atteſt the Truth of our Doctrine, as well, when ſhe diſcloſes her Self freely, and, it IT may ſo ſpeal, of her Own accord, as when ſhe is as it were Cited to make her Depoſitions by the Induſtry of Man. The Obſervations will be but the more ſuitable to our Deſign for being Common and Familiar, as to the Phænomena, though perhaps New enough as to the Application to our Purpoſee. And as for the Experiments, becauſe thoſe that belong more immediately to this or that particular Quality, may be met with in the Notes that treat of It, I thought it not amiſſe that the Experiments ſhould be both Few in number, and yet ſo Pregnant, that every one of them ſhould afford ſuch differing Phæanomena, as may make it applicable to more then One Quality. I. The Obſervation Iwill begin with ſhall be fetcd from what happens in the Hatching of an Egge. For as familiar and obvious a thing as it is, ſeſpecially aſter what the Learned Fabricius ab Aqua pendente, anda recenter Anatomiſt have delivered about them,) that there is a great Change made n the ſubſtance of the Egge, whentis by Incubation turnd into a Chick: yet, as ſar as I know, this Change hath not been taken notice of, for the ſame purpoſe, to which Iam about to apply it. I conſider then, that in a Prolifick Egge, ſfor Inſtance that of a Hen,) às well the Liquor ofthe Yoll, as that of the White. is a Subſtance, as to ſenſe, Similar. For upon the ſame account that Anatomiſts and Phyſicians call ſeveral parts of the humane Body, as Bonres, Membranes, &c. Similar, that is, ſuch, as that every Senſible part ofit hath the ſame Nature or Denomination vith the whole, as every Splinter of Bone is Bone, as every Shred of Skin is Skin. And rhough Ifind by diſtilling the Yolks and Whites, they ſeem to be Diſſimilar Bodies, in regard that the White of an Egge (for Fxample) will afford Subſtances of a very differing Nature, as Flegme, Salt, Oyl, and Earth, vet (not now to examine whether, o how far theſe may be eſteemd Productions of the Fire, that are rather obtaind from the White of the Egge, then were præexiſtent init; not to mention this Iſay,) it doth not appear by Diſtillation, thatthe White ofan Egg, is other then a Similar Body in the ſenſe above deliver'd. For it would be hard IO prove, that one part of the White of an Egę will not be made to yield the ſame differing Subſtances by Diſtillation, that any other part does; and Bones themſelves, and other hard parts of a humane Body, that are confeſiedly Similar, may by Diſtillation be made to aftord Salt, and Phlegme, and Spirit, and Oyl, and Earth, as well as the White of an Eg⸗. This being thus ſetled in the Firſt place, e may in the Next conſider, that by beating the White of an Egge well with a Whisk, you may reduce it trom à ſomewhat Tenacious into a Fluid Body, though this Production of a Li. quor be, as we elſewhere noted, effected by a Divulſion, Agitation &c. of the parts, that is in a word, by a Mechanical change of the Texture of the Body. In the Third place I conſider, that according to the exacteſt Obſervations of Modern Anatomiſts, which our own Obſervations do not contradict, the Rudiments of the Chick, lodgſd. in the Cicatricula, or white Speck upon the Coat of the Yolk, is nouriſhd, till it have obtain'd to be a great Chick, onely by the White of the Egg; the Yoll being by the Providence of Nature reſerv'd as a more ſtrong and ſolid Aliment, till the Chick have abſumd the White, and be thereby grown great and ſtrong enough to digeſt the Yoll; and in eſtect you may ſee the Chick furniſ'd not onely with all the neceſſary, but divers other parts, as Head, Wings, Legs, and Beak, and Claws, whilſt the Yolk ſeems yet as it were untouch'd. But whether this Obſervation about the Entireneſs of the Yolk be preciſely true, is not much material to our preſent purpoſe, nor would Ibe thought to build much upon it; ſince the Yolk it ſelf, eſpecially at that time, is wont to be ſluid enough, and to be a Liquor perhaps no leſs ſo then the White was, and That is enough for my preſent purpoſe. For in the Laſt place Iconſider, that the Nutritive Liquor of an Egꝶg, which is in it ſelfa Body ſo very ſoft, that by a little Agitation it may be made Fluid, and Is readily enongh diſſolvable in common cold water, this. very Subſtance, Iſay, being brooded onby the Hen, will within two or three weeks be tranſmuted into a Chick, furniſnd with Organical parts, as Eyes, Ears, Wings, Legs, &c. of a very differing Fabrick, and with a good number of Similar ones, as Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Tendons, Membrãnes, &c. which differ nother; beſides the Liquors, as Blood, Chyle, Gall, &c. containd in the ſolid parts: So that here we have out of the White of an Egg, which is a Subſtance Similar, Inſipid, Soft, (not to call it Fluid,) Diaphanous, Colourleſſe, and readily diſſoluble in cold water, out of this Subſtance I ſay, we have by the new and various Contrivement of the ſmall parts it conſiſted of, an Animal, ſome of whoſe parts are not Tranſparent but Opacous; ſome of them Red, as the Bloud; ſome Yellow or Greeniſh, as the Gall; ſome White, as the Brain; ſomo Fluid, as the Bloud, and other Juices; ſome Conſiſteut, as the Bones, Fleſh, and other ſtable parts of the Body; ſome Solid and Frangible, as the Bones, others Tough and Flexible, as the Ligaments, others Soft and looſly Cohærent, as the Marrow; ſome without Springs, as many of the parts, ſome with Springs, as the Feathers, ſome apt to mingle readily with cold water, as the Bloud, the Gall; ſome not to be ſo diſſolv}d in it, as the Bones, the Claws, and the Feathers; ſome well taſted, as the Fleſh and Bloud; ſome very ill taſted, as the Gall, (for That Ihave purpoſely and particularly obſervd.) In a word, we have here produc'd out of ſuch an uniforme Matter as the White ofan Egg, Firſt, new kind of Qualities, as (beſides Opacity) Colours, (whereof a ſingle Feather will ſometimes aſtord us Variety,) Odours, Taſts, and Heat in the Heart and Bloud of the Chick; Hardneſs, Smoothneſs, Roughneſ/, &c. Secondly, diverſe other Qualities, that are wont to be diſtinguiſh'd from Senſible ones, as Fluidity (in the Bloud and aqueous humor oſ the Eye,) Conſiſtency in the Griſles, Fleſh, &c. Hardneſſe, Flexibility, Springyneſſe, Toughneſs, unfitneſſe to be diſſolvd in cold water, and ſeveral others. To which may probably be added Thirdly, ſome Occult Properties as Phyſicians obſerve, that ſome Birds, as young Swallows, young Magpies afford Speciſick, or at Ieat Noble Medicines, in the Falling ſickneſs, Hyſterical Fits, and divers other Diſtempers. Fourthly, Ivery well foreſee it may be objected, that the Chick with all its parts is not a Mechanically contriv'd Engine, but faſhion'd out of Matter by the Soul of the Bird, lodgd chiefly in the Cicatricula, which by its Plaſtick power faſhions the obſequious Matter, and becomes the Architect bf its own Meonſion. But not here to examine, whether any Animal, except Man, be o. ther then a Curious Engine, I anſwer, that this Objection invalidates no; what Iintend to prove ſrom the alledg'd Example. For let the Plaſtick Principle be what it ill, yet ſtill, being a Phyſi. cal Agent, it muſt act aſter a Phy ſical manner, and having no other Matter to work upon but the White of the Egg,. it can work upon that Matter but a5 Phyſical Agents, and conſequently can but divide the Matter into minute parts of ſeveral Sizes and Shapes, and by Local Motion variouſly context them, according to the Exigency of the Animal to be producd, though from ſo many various Textures of the producd parts there muſt naturally emerge ſuch differences of Colours, Taſts, and Conſiſtencies, and other Qualities as we have been tæking notice of. That which we are here to conſider, is not what is the Agent or Efficient in theſe Productions, but what is done to the Matter to effect them. And though ſome Birds by an inbred Skill do very Artiſicially build their Curious Neſts, yet cannot Nature, that teaches them, enable them to do any more then ſelect the Materi⸗ als of their Neſts, and by Local Motion divide, tranſport, and connect them after a Certain manner. And when Man himſelf, who is undoubtedly an IntelI2 ligent Agent, is to frame a Building or an Engine, he may indeed by the help of Reaſon and Art, contrive his Materials curiouſly and skilfully, but ſtill all he can do, is but to move, divide, tranſpoſe, and context the ſeveral parts, into which he is able to reduce the Matter aſſignd him. Nor need we imagine, that the Soul of that Hen, which having firſt producd the Egg, does after a while ſitonit, hath any peculiar Efficiency in hatching of a Chick: for the Egg will be well hatch'd by another Hen, though That which laid it be dead; and, which is more, we are aſſur'd by the Teſtimony of very good Authors, as well as of recent Travellers, that in ſome places, eſpecially in ęt, there needs no Bird at all to the Production of a Chick out of an Egg, ſince they hatch multitudes of Eggs by the regulated heat of Ovens, or Dunghils. And indeed, that there is a Motion or Agitation of the A aE  ————i ————ea—tr e. r a ſ119) parts of the Egg by the external heat, whereby it is hatchrd, is evident of its ſelf, and not (as far as I know) denyv'd by anv, and that alſo the white Subſtance is abſumed and contexted, or contrivd into the Body ofthe Chick, and its ſeveral parts, is maniteſt to ſenſe, eſpecially if one hath the Curioſity to obſerve the progreſs of the Chicks Formation and Increment. But astis evident, that as theſe two things, the Subſtance of the White, and the Local Motion, wherein the External Heat neceſſary to Incubation puts its parts, do eminently concurr to the Production of the Chick; ſo that the Formative Power (whatever that be) doth any more then guide theſe Motions, and thereby aſſociate the fitted Particles of Matter aſter the mãnner requiſite to conſtitute a Chick, is that which I think will not eaſily be evinc'd. And I might t o whatI ſaid of the Egg, adde ſeveral things touching the Generation of ViK viparous Animals, which the Learned Eabricius ab Aqua pendente, as well as ſome of the Antient Philoſophers, would have to be generated from an Imperfect kind of Eggs: but I take the Eggs of Birds to be much fitter to inſtance in, becauſe they are things that we have more at command, and wherewith we can conveniently make more Trials and Obſervations; and eſpecially becauſe in perfect Eggs the Matter to be tranſmuted is more cloſely lock'd up, and being kept from any viſible ſupply of Matter, confin'd to be wrought upon by the External Heat, and by its own Vital Principle within. II. Water being generally eſteemd an Elementary Body, and being at leaſt far. more Homogeneous then Bodies here below are wont to be; it may make very much for our preſent purpoſe to ſhew, that Water it ſelf, that is Fluid, Taſtleſs, Inodorous, Diaphanous, Colourleſs, Volatile, &c. may, by a dirfering Texture of its Parts, be brought to conſtitute Bodies of Attributes very diſtant from theſe. This I thought might be done, by nouriſhing Vegetables with ſimple water. For in caſe l could do ſo, all, or the greateſt part of that which would accrue to the Vẽgetable thus nouriſrd, would æppear to have been materially but Water, with what Exotick Quality ſoever it may aſterwards, when tranſmuted, be endow d. The Ingenious Helmont indeed mentions an Experiment ſomewhat of this nature, tHough noò to the ſame purpoſe, which he made by planting a Branch of Willow into a Pot full of Earth, and obſerving the increaſe of Weight he obtaind after divers years, though he fed the Plant but with Rain water. And ſome Learned Modern Naturaliſts have uit at the eaſy Tranſmutableneſſe oF Water, by what happens in Gardens and Orchards, where the ſame Showers or Rain after a long Drought males a great number of differing Plants to flouriſh. But though theſe things be worthy of their Authors, yet I thought they would not be ſo fit for mvy purpoſe, becauſe it may be ſpeci. ouſly enough objected, That the Rain water does not make theſe Plants thrive and ſlouriſh, by immediately affording them the Aliments they aſſimilate into their own Subſtance, but by proving a Vebhicle, that diſſolves the Saline, and other Alimental Subſtances of the Earth, and dilutes both them and the nutritive Juice, which, in æ part of the Plant its ſelf, it may find too much thickned by the Drought or Heat of the ambient Air, and by this meãns it contributes to the nouriſhment of the Plant, though it ſelf be inſenſibly afterwards exhald into vapours. And indeed Experience ſhews us, that ſeveral Plants, that thrive not well without Rain water, are not yet nouriſ'd by it alone, ſince when Cornin the Field, and Fruit-trees in Orchards have conſumd ihe Saline and Sulphureous Juices of the Earth, they will not proſper there, how much Rain ſoever falls upon the Land, till the Ground by Dung or otherwiſe be ſupPlyd again with ſuch aſſimilable Juices. Wherefore I rather choſe to attempt the making of Plants grow in Viols fill'd with Water, not onely to prevent the forementioned Objection, and alſo to make the Experiment leſſe tedious, but that I might have the pleaſure of ſeeing the progreſs of Nature in the Tranſmutation of Water; and my Obſervations of this kind as Novelties, unmentiond by any other Writer, IThewd divers Ingenious Freinds, who having better O pportunities then I of ſtaying in one place, have attempted the like, a nd made ſuccesful Trials, which, Iſuppoſe, will not be conceal’d from the publick. Of my Obſervations about things of this kind, Ican at preſent find but few among my Adver ſaria; but in Them I find enough for my preſent turn. For They and my Memory inform me, that Vinca per Vinca, Raphanus Aquaticus, Spearemint, and even Ranunculus it ſelf, did grow and proſper very well in Viols filld with fair water, by whoſe Necks the Leaves were ſupported, and the Plant kept from ſinking: ſome of theſe were onely Cuttings without Roots, divers of them were left in the water all the Autumn, and great part of the Winter, and at the latter end of January were taken out verdant, and with fair Roots, which they had ſhot in the water. And beſides I find, that particularly a Branch or Sprig of Raphanus Aquaticus was kept full nine Months, and during that time witherd not the whole Winter, and was taken out of the water with many fi. brous Roots, and ſome green Buds, and an increaſe of Weight, and that a Stomò of Ranunculus did ſo proſper in the vater, that in a Months time it had attaind toa pretty deale more then double the weight it had, when it was put in. And the next Note, which I find concerning theſe Plants, informes me, that the above mentiond Crowsfoot being taken out agen at ſix Months after it was put in, weigh'd a Drachm and a half wanting a Grain and a half, that is, ſomewhat above Thrice as much as it did at firſtt. This laſt Circumſtance of the increaſe of Weight) I therefore thought fit particularly to make Trial of, and ſet down upon this account among others, That having doubted the Roots and Leaves, that ſeemd produc'd out of the Water, might really be ſo, by an Oblongation and an Expanſion of the Plants, (as I have purpoſely try, that an Onion weigh'd and laid up in the S pring, though after ſome weeks keeping in the Air it ſhot Blades, whereof one was five Inches long, in ſtead of incorporating the Air or terreſtrial Efflumiums with it ſel, and conſequently thereby growing heavier, had loſt nine Grains of its former weight, ,) it might by this Circumſtance appear, that there may be a real Aſſimilation and Tranſmutation of Water into the Subſtance ofthe Vegetable, as I ellewhere alſo ſhew by other proofs. For this being made out, from thence I infer, That the ſ me Corpuſcles, which, convening together after one manner, compoſe that ſluid, Inodorous, colourſeſs, and inſipid Body of Water being contexted after other manners, may conſtitute differing Concretes, which may have Firmeneſs, Opacity, Odours, Smels, Taſts, Colours, and ſeveral Other manifeſt Qualities, and that too very different from one nother. And beſides all this, theſe diſtinct Portions of Tranſmuted Waoter may have many other Qualities, without excepting thoſe that are wont neſs the ſeveral Medicinal Virtues attributed by Authors to Spearmint, and to Periwinckle, to Majorane, and to R⸗phanus Aquaticus. And à5 for REanunculus, that Plant being reckoned among Poiſonous ones, and among thoſe that raile Bliſters, twill be eaſily grauted, that it hath, as other Poiſons, an Occult Deleterial faculty; and indeed it ſomewhat deſerves our wonder, that ſo inſipid and innocent a thing is fair Water, ſhould be capable to be turnd into a Subſtance of ſuch a piercing and cauſtick Nature, as by Contact to raiſe Bliſters on an humane Body. And yet perhaps that is no leſſe ſtrange, which we elſewhere relate, That a Plant, conſiſting chieſly ot Tranſmuted Water, did by Diſtiſlation afford us a true Oyl, that would not mingle with Water, and conſequently was eaſily convertible into Fire But whether or no this Experiment, or any ſuch like, prove, that almoſt All things may be made of All things, not immediately, but by intervention of ſucceſſive Changes and Diſpoſitions, is a Queſtion to which we elſewhere ſay ſomething, but are not willing in this place to ſay any thing And ifit be here objected, That the ſolid Subſtance, that accrues to a Plant rooted in Water, procceds not at all from the water it ſelf, but from the Nitrous, fat, and earthy Subſtances, that may be preſumd to abound even in common Water, not here to repeat what I elſewhere ſay about this Objection, I ſhall at preſent reply, That though as to divers Plants, that flouriſh after Raine, Iam apt to think, as I intimated above, that they may in part be nouriſd as well by the Saline and Earthy Subſtances, to which the Rain uſually prooves a Vehicle, as by the Rain iũt ſelf; yet as to what the Objection holds forth about the Plants, that grow not in the Ground, but in Glaſſes fill'd with Woater, it ſnould not be barely ſaid but prov'd, whichthe will not perhaps think caſie to be done, that conſiders how vaſt a quantity of fair Water is requiſite to be exhald away, to obtain as much as one Ounce of dry Reſidents, whether Saline or Earthy. III That a Plant, growing in the Earth, doth by the faculties of its Vegetative Soul attract the Juices of the Earth, that are within its reach, and ſelecting thoſe parts that are congruous to its Nature, refuſe the reſt, is the general Opinion of Philoſophers, and Phy ſicians: and therefore many Naturaliſts are not wont much to marvail, when they ſee a Tree bear a Fruit that is ſowr or bitter, becauſe they preſume, that Nature hath in the Root of the Tree cull’d out ſuch parts of the Alimental Juice of the Earth, as being made to convene into one Fruit, are fit to make it of ucha Quiality. Buttis worth obſerving for our preſent purpoſe what happens both in ordinary Graftings, and eſpecially in that kind of Inſition (taking the word in a large ſenſe) which is commonly call'd Inoculation. For though we may preſume, that the Root of a white Thorne ſfor Inſtance) may electively attract its Aliment from the Earth, and chooſe that which is fitteſt to produce the Ignoble fruit, that is proper for that Plam: yet we cannot realonably ſuppoſe, that it ſhould in ĩts attraction of Aliment have any Deſigne of providing an Appropriate Nutriment for a PJre, and yet the known Experience of Gardiners, and our own Obſervations manifeſt, that the Cyons of a Pear tree will take very well upon a White thornſtoc, and bring forth a well taſted fruit, very differing in many qualities from that of the White thorn. I have alſo learn'd from thoſe that are expert, That though Apples and Pears, being but Vulgar Fruit, are ſeldome propagated but by Graſting, yet they may be propagated likewiſe by Inoculation, (hich ſeems to be but a kind of Grafting with a Bud.) Now in the Inoculations, that are made upon Fruit trees, tis very obſervable, and may much countenance what we are endeavouring to prove, that a little Vegetable Buq, (that is no Seed, properly ò calle ,] not ſo big oltentimes as a Pea, ſnould be abſe ſo to tranſmute all the Sap that arrives at it, that though this Sap be already in the Root, ⸗ and in its paſſage upwards determind by Natures Intention, as Men are wont to ſpeal, to the production of the Fruit that is natural to the Stock; yet this Sap ſhould by ſo ſmall a Vegetable Subſtance as a Bud, (whether by the help of ſome peculiar kind of Strainer, or by the Operation of ſome poerful Ferment lodged in it, or by both theſe, or ſome other cauſe ) be ſo far changd and overrul'd, as to conſtitute a Fruit quite otherwiſe quality'd d, then that which is the Genuine production of the Tree, and which is actually produc'd by thoſe other portions of the like Sap, which happend to nouriſh the prolifick Buds that are the Genuine Of-ſpring of the Stock; ſo that the iame Sap, that in one part of a Branch conſtitutes (for inſtance) a Cluſter of Haws, in another part of the ſame Branch may conſtitute a Pear. And that which is further remarkable to our pręſent purpoſe, is, That not onely the ſruites made of the ſame Sap do often differ from one another in Shape, Bigneſs, Colour, Odour, Taſt, and other obvious Quulities, as well as Occult ones: but that though the Sap it ſelf be roftentimes) a Wateriſh and almoſt Inſipid Liquor, that appears to ſenſe Homogeneous enough, and even by Diſtillation affords. very little beſides Flegme, yet this Sap is not onely convertible by Buds of ſeveral Natures into diſfering Fruits, but in one and the ſame Fruit the tranſmuted Sap ſhall by differing Textures be made io exhibit very differing, and ſometimes contrary Qualities. As when (for inſtance; a Peach bud does not onely change the Sap that comes to it into a Fruit, very differing from that which the Stock naturally produceth, but in the Skin of the Peach it muſt be red, in the Kernel whitè, and in other parts of other Colours; the Fleſh of it muſt be fragrant, the Stone inodorous, the Fleſh ſoſt and yielding, the Stone very hard and brittle, the Meat pleaſantly taſted, the Kernel bitter; not to mention, that Peach Bloſſoms, though producd alſo by the Bud, are of a Colour and Texture very differing from that of the Fruit, and are enobled with an Occult Quality, which the Fruit hath not, I mean à Purgative Virtue: So that from Inoculations we may learn, That a ſlegmatick Liquor, that ſeems Homogeneous enough, & but very ſlenderly provided withother manifeſt Qualities then common water, may, by being variouſ]y contexted by the Buds uf Trees, be tranſmuted into Bodies endow'd wirh new, and various, and conſiderable Sents, Colours, Taſts, Soliòity, Medicinal vertues, and divers other Qualities manifeſt, and occult. If it be here ſaid, that theſe Qualities are the productions of the Plaſtick Power reſiding in prolifick Buds, which indeed ſto me) ſeem to be but verv minute Boughs; I ſhall return the ſame Anſwer that Idid to the like Objection, when twas propoſd in the Fuſt Obſervation Hitherto I have onely argued from vulgar Inoculations, but there may be others, as well more conſiderable, as Jeſſe ordinary; and I remember I have ſeen a Tree, whereof, though the Stock was of one ſort of good Fruit, there were three more and differing kinds of Stone- fruit, that had been made to tale lated Boughs had actually Fruit on them, and the third, though it had as yet no Fruit, becauſe the Seaſon for that ſort of Plants to bear it was not yet come, yet the Shoot was ſo flouriſhing, that we concluded. that the Bloſſoms would in due time be ſucceeded by fruit. And ſince Ihave been ſpeaking of the differing Qualities of the parts of the ſame Fruit, I am content to adde two things: the one that Garcias ab Horto, a Claſſick Author, (and Phyſician to the Indian Viceroy) affirmes* with ſome ſolemnity, (as wondering that a Learned man ſhould write orherwiſe,) that though the fruit we call Caſſia fiſtula be very commonly uſd, both here and in the Indies as a Purging Medicine, yet the Seeds of this Solutive Caſſia are Aſtringent. The other: That of late vears there have been oſten brought into England from the Carybbe Iſlands, certain Kernels of a fruit, which thoſe x Aromat, Hiſt. lih. 1. ? 29. de Caſſia ſoiea i that have ſeen it grow, liken to a white Pear- plumme; theſe are ſo ſtrongly Purgative, and alſo Emetick, that the Ingenious Mr. Lygon* tells us, that five of them wrought with him a DoZen times upwards, and above Twenty downwards; and yet the ſame Author aſſures us, (which is likewiſe here a receiv'd Tradition among them that are curious of this fruit,) That in the Kernel, in the parting of it into halfes, (as when our Hazle Nuts in England part ĩn the middle longwiſe) you ſhall find a thin Filme, which looks of a faint Car. nation, (which colour is eaſily enough diſcerned, the reſt of the Kernel being perfectly white,) and that taking out the Filme you may eat the Nut ſafelv, without feeling any Operation at all, andtis as ſeet as a Jordan Almond. A Learned Man, that practiſd Phyſick in America, being inquir'd of by me concerning the Truth of this Relarion, æ Ligons Hiſlory of Barbados. pag. 67. c8, anſwer'd, That though he had divers times given thoſe Nuts as Cathartic Remedies, yet he had not that Curioſity to take out the Filmes, finding it the Univerſal belief, that the Purgative faculty conſiſted therein. And Iremember, that the famous * Monardes doth ſomewhat countenance this Tradition, where ſpeaking of another Purging fruit, that alſo comes from America, (from Cartagena, and Nombre de Dios,) he takes notice, that theſe purging Beans (which are like ours, but ſmaller) have a thin Skin, that divides them through the middle, which muſt (together with the external Rind) be caſt away, elſe they will work ſo violently both upwards and downwards, as to bring the Taker into hazard of his Life: whereas he commends theſe Beans rightly prepar'd, not onely as a pleaſant Medicine, that doth without trouble * gee Nicholaus Mouardes, under the Title, Fabæ Durgatrices. li purge both Choler, Flegme, and groſs Humors, for which it is celebrated among the Indians. To theſe ſtories of our Countrymen, and Monardes, I ſhall ſubjoin another, which Ifind related by that great Rambler about the World, Vincent le Blanck, who giving us an Account of a publick Garden, which he viſited in 4frica, in the Territories of the Lord of Caſima, not far from the Borders of Nubia, which he repreſents as the curioſeſt Garden he ſaw in all the Eaſt, he mentions this among other Rarities, c There were (ſayes he) other ſorts of Fruit, which Inever ſaw but there, and one among the reſt leav'd like a Sycamore, with fruit like the Golden Apple, but no Gall more hitter, and within five Kernels, as big as Almonds, the Juice whereof is ſweet as Sugar, betwixt the Shell and the Nut there grows a thick Skinof a Carnation colour, which Vincut le Biaacks Survey of the World: Part. 2.7. 2 60. taken before they be throughly ripe; they preſerve with Date Vinegar, and make an excellent Sweetmeat, which they preſent to the King as a great Curioſity. IV The Fourth and laſt Obſervation I ſhall at preſent mention, is afforded me by the conſideration of Rotten CheeſeFor if we take notice oſ the difference betwixt two parts of the ſame Cheeſe, whereof the one continues ſound by preſerving its Texture, and the other hath ſuffer'd that Impairing Alteration of Texture we call Rottenneſs, we may often ſee a manifeſt and notable Change in the ſeveral portions ofa Body, that was before Similar. For the Rotten part will differ from the Sound in its Colour, which will be ſometimes Livid, but moſt commonly betwixt Green and Blew; and its odour, which will be both ſtrong and offenſive; and its 7aſt, which will be very Picquant, and to ſome men Il De h much more pleaſant then before, but to moſt men odious; and in divers other Qualities, as particularly its Conſiſtence, it will be much leſſe Solid and more Friable then before; and if with a good Microſcope we look upon the moulded parts of many Cheeſes, we ſhall quickly diſcover therein ſome Swarms of little Animals, (the Mites,) furniſ*d with variety o Parts oſ diftering Sizes, Shapes, Textures, &c. and diſcry a yet greater diverſity, both as to manifeſt Qualities (nor probably is itinferior as to Occult ones) betwixt the Mouldy part of the Cheeſe and the Untainted, then the unaſſiſted Eye could otherwiſe have diſcovered. The following Diſcourſe (OFthe Origine of Forms) ought to have heen placed beſore this ſoregoing Section of òꝶ =ò4h;baꝶ⸗ — ⸗ F He Origine of Forms, Pyophilus, as it is thought the Nobleſi, ſo, if I miſtake not, it hath been found one of the moſt rerplexd Enquiries, that be]Jong to Natural Philoſophy: and, Icon. feſſe, it Is one of the things that has invited me to look about for ſome more ſatisfactory Account, then the Schools uſually give oſ this matter, that I have obſervd, that the wiſeſt that have buſied themſelves in explicating Forms according to the Peripatetick Notions of them. have either knowingly Confeſsd themſelves unable to explain them, or unwittingly Prov'd themſelves æ Formarum cogaitio eſt rudis, conſuſa, nec niſi per 5&rsvorię; nrque verum eſt, formæ ſubſtantialis ſreciem iecipi in intellectum.non enim in ſenlu uſuam ſuit.J.C.

Sennertus, to be ſo, by giving but unſatisfactory Explications of themmIt will not (Ipreſume) be expected, that I who now write but Notes, ſhould enumerate, much leſſe examine all the various Opinions touching the Origine and Nature of Forms, it being enough for our purpoſe, if, having already intimated in our Hypotheſis what, according to that, may be thought of this Subject; we now brieſly conſider the general Opinion of our Modern Ariſtotelians and the Schools concerning it. I ſay, the Modern Ariſtotelians, becauſe diverſe of the Antient, eſpecially Gree Commentators of Ariſtotle, ſeem to have underſtood their Maſters Doctrine of Forms much otherwiſe, and leſſe incongruouſly, then his Latin followers, the Schoolmen and others, have ſince done- Nor do Iexpreſly mention Ariſtotle himſelf among the Champions of ſubſtantial Forms, becauſe though he ſeem in a place or two expreſly enough to reckon Formes among Subſtances, yet elſewhere the Examples he imploies to ſet forth the Forms of Natural things by, being taken from the Figures of artificial things, ras of a Statue, &c.) which are confeſſedly but Accidents, and making very little uſe, if anv, of Subſtantial Forms to explain the Phænomena of Nature, He ſeems to me upon the whole matter, either to huve been irreſolvd, whether there were any ſuch Subſtances, or no, or to ſpeak ambiguouſly and obſcurely enough of them, to make it queſtionable, what his Opinions of them ere. But the ſumme of the Controverſy betwixt Us and the Schools is this, whether or no the Forms of Natural things, (the Souls of Men alwaies excepted) be in Generation educed, as they ſpeak, out of the power of the Matter, and whether theſę Forms be true ſubitantial Entities, diſtinct from the other ſubſtantial Principle of Natural Bodies, The Reaſons that move me to embrace the Negative, are principally theſe three. Firſt, That Iſee no neceſſity of admitting in Natural things any ſuch ſubſtantial Forms, Matter and the Accidents of Matter being ſuſficient to explicate as much of the rhænomena of Nature, as we eſther do or are like to underſtand. The neæt, That I ſee not what uſe this puzling Doctrinę of ſubſtantial Forms is of in Natural Philoſophy; the Acute scaliger, and thoſe that have moſt buſied themſelves in the Indagation of them, having freely acknowledgd, (as the more Candid of the Peripateticks generally do,) That the true Knowledg of Forms is too difficult and abſtruſe to be attaind by them. And how like it is, that particular Phænomena will be explain'd by a Principal, whoſe Nature is confeſſedly ignord, I leave you to judę: but becauſe to theſe conſiderations I often have had, and ſhall have here and there occaſion to ſay ſomething in the body of theſe Notes, I ſhall at preſent inſiſt upon the third, which is, That I cannot conceive, neither how Forms can be generated, as the Peripateticks would have it, nor how the things, they aſcribe to them, are conſiſtent with the Principles of true Philoſophy, or even with what themſelves otherwiſe teach. The Manner how Forms are educed out of the Power of the Matter, according to that part of the Doctrine of Forms, wherein the Schools generally enough agree, is a thing ſo Inexplicable, that I wonder not it hath put Acute men upon ſeveral Hypotheſes to make it out. And indeed the number of Theſe is of late grown too great to be fit to be here recited, eſpecially ſince I ſind them all ſo very unſatisfactory, that I cannot but think, the acute Stichlers for any of them are rather driven to embrace it by the palpable inconveniences of the wayes they reject, then by any thing thev find to ſatisſy them, in that which they male choice of: and for my part I confeſ, Ifind ſo much Reaſon in what each Party ſayes againſt the Explications of thereſt, that I think they all Confute well, and none does well Eſtabliſh, But my preſent way of Writing forbidding me to inſiſt on many Arguments againſt the Doctrine, where:n they moſt agree, I ſhall onely urge, That which Iconfeſ chieſly ſticks with me, namely that I ſind it not Comprehenſible. I know the Modern Schoolmen ſly here to their vonted Refuge of an Obſcure Diſtinction, aud tell us, that the Power of Matter in reference to Forms is partly Eductive, as the Agent can make the Form out oſ it, and partly Receptive, whereby it can receive the Form ſo made; but ſince thoſe that ſay this, will not allow, that the Form ofa generated Body was actually præexiſtent in its Matter, or indeed any where elſe, tis hard to conceive, how a Subſtance can be educd out of another Subſtance totally diſtinct in Nature from it, without being, before ſuch Eduction, actuully exiſtent init. And as for the Receptive Power of the Matter, That but ſitting it to receive or lodge a Form, when brought to be United with it, how can it be intelligibly made out to contribute to the Production of a new Subſtance, of a quite differing Nature from that Matter, though it harbours it when producd? Andtis plain, that the Humane Body hath a receptive Power in reference to the Humane Soule, which yet themſelves conteſs both to be a ſubſtantial Form, and not to be educd out of the Power of Matter. Indeed if they would admit the Form ofa Natural Body to be hut a more fine and ſubtle part of the Matter, as Spirit of Wine is of We ine, which upon its receſs remains no longer Wine, but Plegm or Vinegar, then the Eductive Power of Matter M might might ſignifie ſomething; and ſo it might, it with us they would allow the Form to be but a Modification oſ the Mattter; for then it would import but that the Matter may be ſo orderd or diſpoſd by fit Agents, as to conſtitute a Body of ſuch a ſort and Denomination: and ſo (to reſume that Example) the Form ofa Sphære may be ſaid to lurk potentially in a piece of Braſ/, in as much as that Braſs may by caſting, turning, or otherwiſe, be ſo figurd as to become a Sphære. But this they will not admit, leaſt they ſhould make Forms to be but Accidents, though it is for ought I know as little intelligible, how what is educ'd out oſ anv Matter, without being either præexiſtent, or being anv part of the Matter, can be a true Subſtance, as how that Roundneſs, that makes a piece of Braſs become a Sphere, can be a new Subſtance in itt. Nor can they admit the orher ay of educing a Form out of Matter, as Spirit is out of Wine, becauſe then not onely Matter will be corruptible againſt their grounds, but Matter and Form would not be two differing and ſubſtantial Principles, but one and the ſame, though diverſify’d by firmneſs, and groſſeneſs, &c. which are but Accidenral differences. I know they ſpeak much of the efficacy of the Agent upon the Matter, in the Generation of Natural Bodies, and tell us ſtrange things ofhis manner of working. But not to ſpend time in examining thoſe obſcure niceties, I anſwer in ſhort; That ſince the Agent, be he what he will, is but a Phyſical and finite Agent, and ſince what way ſoever he works, he can do noth ng repugnant to the nature of things, the difficulty, that ſticks with me, will ſtill remain. For if the Form produc’d in Generation, be, as they would have it, æa Subſtance, that was not before to be found any where out of that portion of Matter, wherewith it conſtitutes the Generated Body, T ſay that either it muſt be producd, by refining or ſubtiliating ſome parts of the Matter into For m, or elſe it muſt be producd out of nothing, that is, Creatæd, (for I ſee no Third ay,how a Subſtance can be producd e novo.) If they allow the Firſt, then will the Form be indeed a Subſtance, but not, as they hold itis, diſtinct from Matter, ſince Matter, however ſubtiliated, is Matter ſtill, as the ſineſt Spirit of Wine is as truly a Body, æs was the Wine it ſelt, that yeilded it, or as is the Groſſer Flegm, from hich it was extracted: beſi des that, the Peripatetics teach, that the Formiis not made of any thing of the Matter; nor indeed is it conceivable, how a Phyſ ical Agent can turn a Materl into an Immaterial Subſtance, eſpecially Matter being, as they themſelves confeſſe, as well incorruptible as ingenerable. But if they will not allow, as ndeed they do not, that the ubſtuihi Form is made give me leave to believe, that tis producd out of Nothing, tll they ſhew me, how a Subſtance can be producd otherwiſe, that exiſted no where before. And at this rate every Natural Body ofa ſpecial Denomination, as Gold, Marble, Nitre, &c. muſt not be producd barely by Generation, but partly by Generation, and partly by Creation. And ſince tis confeſſd on all ſides, that no Natural Agent can produce the leaſt Atome of Matter, tis ſtrange they ſhould in Generation allow every Phyſical Agent the power of producing a Form, which, according to them, is not onely a Subſtance, but a far nobler one then Matter, and thereby attribute to the meaneſt Creatures that power of creating Subſtances, which the Antient Naturaliſts thought too great to be aſcrib'd to God himſelf, and which indeed is too great to be aſcribd to any other then Him, and therefore ſome Schoolmen and Philoſophers have deriv'd Forms immediately from God; but this is not onely to deſert Ariſtotle and the Peripatetick Philoſophy they would ſeem to maintain, but to put Omnipotence upon working I know not how many thouſand Miracles every hour, to performe that  mean the Generation of Bodies of new Denominations) in a ſupernatural way, which ſeems the moſt familiar effect of Nature in her ordinary courſee. lill And as the Production of Forms out of the Power of Matter is for theſe Reaſons incomprehenſible to me, ſo thoſe things, which the Peripateticks aſcribe to their ſubſtantial Forms, are ſome of them ſuch, as, I confeſſe, Icannot reconcilemy Reaſon to: for they tell us poſitively, that theſe Forms are Subſtances, and yet at the ſame time they teach, that they depend upon Matter, both in fieri and in eſſe, as they ſpeak, ſo that out of the Matter, that ſupports them, they cannot ſo much as exiſt, (whencę they are uſually call'd Material Forms,) which is to make them Subſtances in name, and but Accidents in truth: for not to ask how(among Phyſical things) one Subſtance can be ſaid to depend upon another in fieri, that is not made of any part of it, the very notion of a Subſtance is to be a ſelſ- ſubſiſting Enti. ty,or thot which needs noother Created Being to ſupportit, or to make it exiſt. Beſides that, there being but two ſorts of Subſtances, Material, and Immaterial, a ſubſtantial Form muſt appertain to one of the two, and yet they aſcribe things to it, that make it very unſt to be referrd to either. To allthis Iadde, that theſe imaginary Material Forms do almoſt as much trouble the Doctrine of Corruption, às that of Generation: for if a Form be a true Subſtance really diſtinct from Matter, it muſt, as I lately noted, be able to exiſt of it ſelf, without any other Subſtance to ſupport it; as thoſe I reaſon with confeſs, that the Soul of Min ſurvives the Body, it did before Death inform: whereas they will have it, that in Corruption the Form is quite aboliſd, and utterly periſhes, as not being capable of exiſting, ſeparated from the Matter, Whereunto it was united: ſo that here again, what they call a Subſtance they make indeed an Accident, and beſides contradict their own vulgar Doctrine, That Natural things are npon their Corſuption reſolv}] into the firſt Matter, ſince at this rate they ſhould ſay, that ſuch things are but partly reſolvã intothe firſt Matter, and partly either into Nothing, or into Forms, which being as well immaterial as the Souls of Men, muſt, for ought appears, be alſo, like them, accounted immortal. I ſhould now examine thoſe Arguments, that are wont to be imploy di by the Schools to evince their ſubſtantial Forms, but, beſides that the nature and ſcope of my preſent Work injoynes me Brevity, I confeſſe that, one or two excepted, the Arguments I have found mention'd, as the chief, are rather Metaphy ſical, or Logical, then grounded upon the Principles and Phænomena of Nature, and reſpect rather Words then Things, and therefore I, who have neither inclination, nor leaſure, to wrãangle about Terms, ſhall content my ſelf to propoſe, and very briefly anſwer two or three oſ thoſe that are thought the plauſibleſt. Firſt then they thus argue. omne Compoſitum ſubſtantiale (tor it is hard to Engliſh well ſuch Uncouth Terms) requirit materiam & formam ſubſtantialem, ex quibus componatur. Omue corpus naturale eſt compoſitũ ſubſtantiale. Ergo 8c. In this Syllogiſme ſome do plauſibly enough deny the Conſequence, but for brevities ſake, I ſhall rather chooſe to deny the Minor, and deſire the Propoſers to prove it, For Iknow I not not anv thing in Nature that is compoſd of Matter, and a Subſtance diſtinct from Matter, except Man, who alone is made up of an immaterial Form, and a humane Body; and if it be urg⸗d, that then other Bodies cannot be properly ſaid to be Compoſita ſubſtantialia: I ſhnll, rather then wrangle with them, give them leave to find out ſome other name for other Natural things. But then they argue in the next place, that, if there were no ſubſtantial Forms, all Bodies would be but Entia per accidens, as they ſpeak, which is abſurd. To which Ianſwer, That in the Notion, that divers Learned men have of an Ens per Accidens, namely, that tis That which conſiſts of thoſe things, quæ non ordinantur ad unum, it may be ſaid, That though we do not admit ſubſtantial Forms, yet we need not admit Natural Bodies to be Entia per accidens; becauſe in them the ſeveral things that concur to conſtitute the Body, as Matter, Shape, Scituation, and Motion, orãinantur per ſe & intrinſecè to conſtitute one Natural Body. But, if this Antwer ſatisfie not, Iſhall adde, that for mV part, That which I am ſollicitous about, is, hat Nature hath made things to be in themſelves, not what a Logician or Metaphy ſician will call them in the Terms of his Art; it being much fitter in my judgment to alter Words, that they may better fit the Nature of Things, then to æffix a wrong Nature to Things, that they may be accommodated to forms of Words, that were probably deviſ'd, when the things themſelves were not known or vvell underſtood, ifat all thought on. Wherefore I ſhall but adde one Argument more of this ſort, and That is, that, if there vvere no ſubſtantial Forms, neither could there be any ſubſtantial Defſinitions, but the Conſequent is abſurd, anò therefore ſo is the Antecedent. To vhich Ireply, that ſince the PeriII pateticks themſelves confeſs the Forms of Bodies to be of themſelves unnown, all that this Argument ſeems to me to conclude, is but this, That if we do not admit ſometrhings, that are not i⸗ rerum natnra, we cannot build our Definitions upon them: nor indeed could we, it we ſhould admit ſubſtantial Forms, give ſubſtantial Deſinitions of Natural things, unleſſe we could alſo define Natural Bodies by things that we know not; for ſuch* the ſubſtantial Forms are ſas we have ſeen already)confeſſ'd to be, by the wiſeſt Peripateticks, who pretend not to give the ſubſtantial Defſinition of any Natural Compoſitum, except Man. But it may ſuffice Us to have, inſtead of ſubſtantial, eſential Definitions ot things; I mean ſuch as are taken from the Eſſential Differences of things, which conſtitute them in ſuch ãa ſort of Natural Bodies, and diſcriminate  Nego tibi ullam eſſe ſormam nobis notam plenè & plauè, noſtramq;; ſcientiam eſſe mbram in Sole. Scalig. them from all thoſe of any other ſort⸗ Theſe three Arguments, Pyrophilus, for ſubſtantial Forms, You may poſſibly, as well as I, find variouſly propoſd, and perhaps with ſome light alterations multiplyd in the writings of the Peripateticks and Schoolmen; but all the Arguments of this kind that I have met with, may, if Imiſtake not, be ſuſficiently ſolv'd by the Anſwers we have given to theſe, orat leaſt by the grounds upon which thoſe Anſwers are built; thoſe ſeemingly various Aiguments agreeing in this, That erther they reſpect rather Words then Things, or that they are grounded upon precarious Suppoſi. tions; or laſtly that they urge That as an Abſurdity, which, whether it be one or not in thoſe, that adqmit the Peripatetick Philoſcphy, to me, that doas little acquieſce in many of their other Principles, as Ido in their ſubſtantial Forms, doth not appear any Abſurdity at all. And tis perhaps for fear that Argulll ments of this ſort ſhould not much prevaile with Naturaliſts, that ſome of the Modern aſſertors of the Forms we queſtion, have thought it requiſite to addc ſome more Phy ſical Arguments, which (though Ihave not found them all in the ſame Writers, yet) being in all but few, I ſhall here briefly conſider them. Firſt then among the Phy ſical Arguments, that are brought to prove ſubſtantial Forms, I find That the moſt confidently inſiſted on, which is taken from the ſpontaneous return of heated Water to Coldneſs, which Effects, ſay they, muſt neceſſarily be aſcribd to the Action of the ſubſtantial Form, whoſe office it is to preſerve the Body in its Natural ſtate, and, when there is occaſion, to reduce it thereunto: and the Argument indeed might be plauſible, if we were ſure, that heated Water would grow cold again (without the Avolation of any Parts more agitated thenthe reſt,) ſuppoſing it to be removd into ſome of the imaginary ſpaces beyond the World; but as the caſe is, Iſee no neceſſity of ſlying to a ſubſtantial Form, the Matter ſeeming to be eaſily explicable otherwiſe. The Water we heat is ſurrounded with our Air, or with ſome Veſſel, or other Body contiguous to the Air, and both the Air and the Woater in theſe Climates are moſt commonly leſſe agitated, then the Juices in our hands, or other Organs of Touching, which makes us eſteem and call thoſe Fluids, cold. Now when the Water is expoſſd to the fire, it is thereby put into a new Agitation, more vehement then that of the parts of our Sen. ſory, which you will eaſily grant, if you conſider, that when the Heat is intenſe, it makes the Water boyl and ſmoa, and oftentimes run over the Veſſel; but when the Liquor is removd from the fire, this acquird Agitation muſt needs by degrees be loſt, either by the avolation of ſuch fiery Corpuſcles as the Epicureans imagine to be got into heated Water, or by the Water's communicating the Agitation of ĩts Parts to the contiguous Air, or to the Veſſel that contains it, till it have loſt its ſurpluſage of Motion, or by the ingreſs of thoſe frigorifick Atoms, wherewith ſif any ſuch be to be granteq) the Airin theſe Climates is wont to abound, and ſo be reduc'd into its former Temperature: which may as well be done without a ſubſtantial Form, 25 if a Ship ſwimming ſ=lowly down a River, ſnould by a ſudden guſt of Wind, blowing the ſame way the Stream runs, be driven on much faſter then before, the Veſſel upon the ceaſing of the Wind may, without any ſuch internal principle, ræturo aſter a while to ĩts former ſlowneſs of Motion. So that in this Phænomenon;we need not have recourſe to an internal principle, the Temperature of the external Air being ſufficient to give an acconnt ofit. And it Water be ept, (as is uiili ſual in poor mens houſes that want Cellars,) in the upper looms of the houſe, in caſe the Climate be hot, the Water will, in ſpight of the Form, continue far leſſe cold, then, accordlng to the Peripateticks, its nature requires, all the Summer long. And let me here repreſent to the Champions of Forms, that, according to their Doctrine, the Fluidity of Water, muſt at Ieaſt as much proceed from its Form as the Coldneſſe, and yet this does ſo much depend upon the Temperature of the Air, that in Nova Zembla vaſt quantities of Water are kept in the hard and ſolid Form of Ice all the year long, by the ſharò Cold of the ambient Air, notwithſtanding all the pretended Oſice and Power of the ſubſtantial Form to keep it ſluid, which it will never be reducd to be, unleſſe by ſuch a thawing Temperature of the Air, as would it ſelf, for ought appears, make it ſlow again, although there were no ſubſtantiN2 al Form in rerum naturã. There is another Argument much urg'd of late by ſome Learned Men, the ſubſtance whereoſ is this; That Matter being indifferent to one ſort of Accidents as well as to another, it is neceſſory there ſould be a ſubſtantial Form, 10 heep thoſe Accidents, which are ſaid to conſtitue it, united to the Matter they belong to, and preſerve both them and the Body in their Natural ſtate, for ſince tis confeſſd, that Matter hath no appetite to theſe Accidents, more then to any others, they demand, how with. out a ſubſtantial Form theſe Accidents can be containd and preſervd? To this I might repreſent, that Iam not ſo well ſatisty’d with the Notion wont to be taken for granted, not onely by the vulgar, but by Philoſophers, of the Notural ſtate of Bodies; as ifit were undeniable, that every Natural Body, (for as to ſome, I ſhall not now queſtion it,) has a certain ſtate, wherein Nature en. deavours to preſerve it, and out ofwhich it cannot be put, but by being put into a Præternatural ſtate. For the Worldbeing ouce conſtituted by the great Author òf Things, às it now is, Ilook upon the Phænomena of Nature to be cauſd by the Local Motion of one part of li Matter hitting againſt another, and am not ſo fully convincd, that there is ſuch a thing, as Natures deſigning to keep ſuch a parcel of Matter in ſuch a ſtatę, that is clothd with juſt ſuch Accidents, rather then with any other. But Ilook upon many Bodies, eſpecially ſluid ones, as ſrequently changing their ſtate, according as they happen to be more or leſſe agitated, or otherwiſe wrought upon by the Sun,. and other conſiderable Agents in Nature. As the Air, Water, and other Fluids, if the temperature a to Cold or Heat, and Rarefaction or Condenſation, which they are in at the.. beginning of the Spring here at London,, be pitcht upon as their Natural ſtate, then not onely in the torrid and frozen Zones they muſt have other and very differing Natural ſtates, but here it ſelf they will, almoſt all the Summer and all the Winter, as our Weather Glaſſes inform us, be in a varying Præternatural ſtate, becauſe they will be in thoſe ſeaſons either more hot and rarify'd, or more cold and condenſſd, then in the beginning of the Spring. And in more ſtable and conſtant Bodies I take, in mãny caſes, the Natural ſtate to be but either the moſt uſual state, or That, wherein that, vhich produces a notable Change in them, ſinds them As when a ſlender piece of Silver, that is moſt commonly ſlexible, and will ſtand bent every way, comes to be well hammer'd, I count that Flexibility to be the Natural ſtate of that Mettal, becauſe moſt commonly Silver is found to be flexible, and becauſe it was ſo before it was hammerds; but the Springineſſe it acquires by hammering is a ſtate, whichis properly no more unnatural to the Silver then the other, and would continue with the Mettal as long as It, if both pieces of Silver, the one flexible, the other Ipringy, were let alone, and kept from outward violence: And as the Silver, to be deprivd oſ its flexibleneſs, needed the violent Motion of the Hammer, ſo to deprive it ofits Spring, it needs the violent Agitation of a nealing fire. Theſe things, and much more, I might here repreſent, but to come cloſe to the Objection, I Anſwer, That the Accidents ſpoken of are introduced into the Matter by the Agents or Efficient Cauſes, whatever they be, that produce in it what, in the ſenſe formerly explained, we call an eſſential(though not a ſubſtantial; Form. And theſe Accidents being once thus introducd into the Matter, we need not ſeek for a new ſubſtantial Principle to preſerve them there, ſince by the general lIaw, or common courſe of Nature, the Matter qualifyd by them, muſt continue in the ſtate ſuch Accidents have put it into, till, by ſome Agent or other, it be forcibly putout of it. and ſo diveſted of thoſe Accidents; as in the formerly mention'd Example, borrowd from Ariſtotle, of a Brazen Sphære, when once the Motion of Tools, impelld and guided by the Artificer, have turn'd a piece of Braſs into a Sphære, there needs no new Subſtance to preſerve that round figure, ſince the Braſſe muſt retain it, till it be deſtroy/d by the Artificer himſelf, or ſome other Agent able to overcome the reſiſtance of the Matter, to be put into another figur. And on this occaſion let me confirme this ad hominem, by repreſenting, That there is not an inconſiderable Party among the Peripateticks themſelves. who maintain, That in the Elements the Firſt Qualities (as they call them) are inſtead of Forms, and that the Fire (for inſtance) hath no other Form then Heat and Dryneſſe, ànd the Water then Coldneſſe and Moiſture. Now if theſe Bodies, that are the vaſteſt and the moſt important of the Sublunary World, conſiſt but ot the Univerſal Matter, and the few Accidents; and if in theſe there needs no ſubſtantial Form to keep the Qualities of the Matter united to it, and conjoyn'd among themſelves, and preſerve them in that ſtate, as long as the Law of Nature requires, though beſides the four Qualities that are call'd Firſt, the Elements have divers others, as Gravity ãnd Levity, Firmneſſe and Fluidity, Opacouſneſſe and Tranſparency, &c. why ſhould the favourers of this Opinion deny, That, in other Bodies beſides the Elements, Qualities may be preſervod and kept united to the Matter they belong to, without the Band or Support of a ſubſtantial Form? And as, when there is no competent deſtructive Cauſe, the Accidents of a Body willby the Law of Nature remain ſuch as they ere; ſo if there be, it cannot ith reaſon be pretended, that the ſubſtantial Form is able to preſerve all thoſe Accidents oſ a Body, that are ſaid to ſlo from it, and to be as it were under its care and tuition; for if, for inſtance, you expoſe a Sphære or Bullet of Lead to a ſtrong fire, it will quickly looſe (not to mention its Figure) both its Coldneſs, its Conſiſtence, its Malleableneſs, its Colour, (for till appear of the colour of fire,] its Flexibility, and ſome other Qualities, and all this in ſpight of the imaginary ſubſtantial Form, which, according to the Peripatetical Principles, in this caſe muſt ſtiſl remain in it without being able to help itt. And though upon the taking the Lead from off the fire, it is wont to be reduc'd to moſt of its former Qualities, (for it will not ofiit ſelf recover its Sphæricity,) yet That may well be alcrib d partly to its peculiar Texture, and partly to the Coldneſs of the ambient Air, according to what we nmart L /& /—am/——~/-~ ii ---— (173) lately diſcourſd tonching heated and refrigerated Water, which Temperature of the Air is an extrinſecal thing to the Lead, and indeed it is but Accidental, that the Lead upon reſrigeration regains its fFormer Qualities, for in caſe the Lead have been expoſd long enough to a ſuſficiently intenſe fire, it will (as we have purpoſely tryd) be turn'd into Glaſſe, and looſe its colour, its opacity, its malleableneſs, and (former degree of) ſlexibleneſſe, and acquire a Reddiſhneſs, a degree of Tranſparency, a Brittleneſſe, and ſome other Qualities, that it had not before: and let the ſuppoſed ſubſtantial Form do what it can, even when the Veſſel is removd from the fire, toreduce orreſtore the Body to its Natural ſtate and Accidents, yet the former Qualities ill remain loſt, as long as theſe Præternatural ones, introduc'd by the fire, continue in the Matter, and neither the onẽ will be reſtor'd, nor the other deſtroyd, till ſome ſuſficiently powerſul extrinſick Agent effect the Change. And on the other ſide I conſider, that the Fruit. when ſeverd from the Tree it grew on, is confeſſd to be no longer animated (at leaſt the Kernels or Seeds excepted) by the Vegetative Soul, or ſubſtantial Form of the Plant; yet in an Orange or Lemmon (for inſtance) pluckt from the Tree, we ſee, that the ſame Colour, the ſame Odour, the ſame Taſt, the ſame Figure, the ſame Conſiſtence, and, for ought we know, the ſame other Qualities, whether ſenſible, or even occult, as are its Antidotal and Antiſcorbutical virtues, that muſt before be ſaid to have flowd from the Soul of the Tree, will continue, many months, perhaps ſome years, atter the fruit has ceaſd to have any commerce with the Tree, (nay though the Tree, whereon it grew, be perhaps in the mean time hewn down or burnt, ànd though conſequently its Vegetative Soul or Form be deſtroyd,) as when it grew therẽon, and made up one Dlant with it. And we find, that Tamarinds, Rhubarb, Senna, and many other Simples will for divers years, aſter they have been depriv'd of their former Vegetative Soul, retain their Purgative and other Specific properties. I find it likewiſe urg°d, that there can be no Reaſon, why Wtiteneſs ſhould be ſeparable from a Wall, and not from Snow or Milk; unleſſe we have recourſe to ſubſtantial Forms. But in caſe men have agreed to call a thing by ſuch a name, becauſe it has ſuch a particular Quality, that differences it from others, we need go no farther to find a Reaſon, why one Quality is eſſential to one thing, and not to anotherr. As in our for mer example of a Braſs Sphære, the Figure is that, for which we give it that Name, and therefore, though you may alter the figure of the Matter, yet by that very alteration the Body periſhes in the capacity ofa Sphære, whereas its Coldneſs may be exchangd for Heat, without the making it the leſs a Sphære, becauſe tis not for any ſuch Quality, but for Roundneſs, that a Body is ſaid to be a Sphære. And ſo Firmneſs is an inſeparable Quality oſ Ice, though this or that particular Figure be not, becauſe that tis for want of fluidity, that any thing, that was immediately before a Liquor, is call'd Ice, and congruouſly hereunto, though Whiteneſs were inſeparable from Snow and Milk, yet that would not neceſſarily infer, that there muſt be a ſubſtantial Form to make it ſo: for the Firmneſs of the Corpuſcles, that compoſe Snow, is as inſeparable from it, as the Whiteneſſe; and yet is not pretended to be the effect of the ſubſtantial Form of the Water, but of the exceſe of the Coldneſſe of the Air, which ſto uſe vulgar, though perhaps unaccurate, expreſſions,) puts the Water out of its Natural ſtate of Tluidity, and into a Præternatural onè Firmneſs and Brittleneſs. And the reaſon, why Snow ſeldome looſes its whiteneſs but with its nature, ſeems to be, that its component Particles are ſo diſpoſd, that the ſame heat of the ambient Alr, that is ſit to turn it into atranſparent Body, is alſo fit to make it a fluid one, which when it is become, we no longer call it Snow, but Water; ſo that the Water looſes its whiteneſs, though the Snow do not. But if there be a cauſe proper to make a convenient alteration of Texture in the Snow, without mel. ting or reſolving it into water, it may then exchange its Whiteneſs for Yellowneſſe, without Iooſing its right to be calld Snow; as, Iremember. I have read in an eminent Writer, that àf facto in the Northern Regions towards the Pole, thoſe parcels of Snow, that have Iain very long on the ground, degenerate in time into a Yellowiſh colour, very differing from that pure Whiteneſs to be obſerv'd in the neighbouring Snow lately fallen. But there yet remains an Argument for ſubſtantial Forms, which though (perhaps becauſe Phyſical) wont to be overlookd, or ſlightly anſwer'd by their Oppoſers, will for the ſame reaſon deſerve to be taken notice of here; and it is, That there ſeems to be a neceſſity of admitting ſubſtantial Forms in Bodies, that from thence we may derive all the various changes, to which they are ſubject, and the differing Effects they produce, ſ the Preſervation and Reſtitution of the State requiſite to each particular Body,  as alſo the keeping of its ſeveral parts united into one Totum. To the anſwering of this Argument, ſo many things will be found applicable, both in the paſt and ſubſequent parts of theſe Notes, that Iſhall at preſent but point the chief particulars, on which the Solution is grounded. I conſider then ſirſt, that many and dies, which ſeem munifeſtly to proceed from their. peculiar Texture, and the Action of outward Agents upon them, and of which it cannot be ſhewn, that they would happen otherwiſe, though there were no ſubſtantial Forms in rerum natura: as we ſee that Tallow (for inſtance) being melted by the fire looſes its Coldneſs, Firmneſs, and its Whiteneſs, and acquires Heat, Fluidity,. and ſome Tranſparency, all which, being ſuffer'd to cool, it preſently exchanges for the three firſt namd Qualities. And yet divers of theſe Changes are plainly enough the effects partly of the Fire, partly of the ambient Air, and not of I know not what ſubſtantial Form: and it is both' evident and remarkable, what great variety of changes in Qualities, and Productions of new ones, the Fire (that is, a Body conſiſting of inſenſible parts, that are variouſly and vehemently movd) doth effect by its Heat, that is, by a modifyd Local Motion. I conſider further, that various Operations of a Body may be derivd from the peculũar Texture of the Whole, and the Mechonical Affections oſ the particular Corpuſcles or other parts that compoſe it, as we have often occaſion to declare here and there in this Treatiſe; and particuIarly by an Inſtance, ere long to be further inſiſted on, namely, that though Vitriol, made of Iron with a Corroſive liquor, be but a factitious Body, made by a convenient appoſition of the ſmall parts of the ſaline Menſtruum to thoſe of the Mettal, yvet this Vitriol will do moſt, if not all, of the ſame things, that Vitriol, made by Nature in the bowels of the Earth, and diggd out thence, will perform; and each of theſe Bodies may be endowd with variety of differing Qualities, which I ſee not, why they muſt flow, in the native Vitriol, from a ſubſtantial Form, ſince in the factitious Vitriol, the ſame Qualities belong to a Form, that does plainly emerge from the coalition of Metalline and Salinę Corpuſcles, aſſociated together and diipoſdoſ after a certain manner, And lIaſtly, as to what is very conſidently, as well as plauſibly, pretended, That a ſubſtantial Form is requiſite to keep the parts of a Body united, without which it would not be one Body. Ianſwer, That the contrivance of conveniently figur'd parts, and in ſome caſes their juxta: poſition, mav without the aſſiſtance of a ſubſtantial Form be ſufficient for this matter; for not to repeat what Ijuſt now mention'd concerning Vitriol made by Art, whoſe Parts are as well united and kept together, as thoſe of the Native Vitriol, Iobſerve, that a Pear grafted upon a Thorn, or a Plum inoculated upon an Apricock, will bear good fruit, and grow up with the Stock, as though they both made but one Tree, and were animated but by the ſame common Form; whereas indeed both the Stock and the inoculated or grated Plant have each of them its own Form, as may appear by the differing ]eaves, and fruits, and ſeeds they bear. And that which makes to our preſent purpoſe is, that even Vegetation and the Diſtribution oſ Aliments are in ſuch caſes well made, though the nouriſd parts of the Total Plant, if I may ſo call it, have not one common Soul or Form, which is yet more remarkable in the Miſſetoes, that Ihave ſeen growing uponold Hazletrees, Crab- trees, Appletrees, and other plants, in which the Miſletoe oſten differs very widely from that kind of Plant on which it grows and proſpers. And for the durableneſſe of the Union betwixt Bodies that a ſubſtantial Form is not requiſite to procure it, I have been inducd to think by con. ſidering, that Sitver and Gold, being barely mingl'd by Infuſion, will have their minute parts more cloſely united, then thoſe of any Plant or Animal that we know of. And there is ſcarce any Natural Body, wherein the Form males ſo ſtrict, durable, and indiſſoluble an Union of the parts it conſiſts of, as that, which, in that Factitious Concrete ve call Glaſs, ariſes from the bare commiſtion of the Corpuſcles of Sand with thoſe Saline ones, wherewith they are colliquated by the violence of the fire: and the like may be ſaid of the Union oſ the proper Accidents of Glaſſe ith the Matter of it, ànd betwixt one another. To draw towards a Concluſion,] know tis alledg'd as a main Conſideration on the behalf of ſubſtantial Forms, that theſe being in Natural Bodies the true principles of their Properties, and conſequently oſ their Operations, their Natural Philoſophy muſt needs be very imperfect and defective, who will not take in ſuch Forms: but for my purtI confeſs, that this very conſideration does rather indiſpoſe then incline me to admit them. For if indeed there were in every Natural Body ſuch a thing as a ſubſtantial Form, from which all its Properties and Qualities immediately flow, ſince we ſee that the Actions of Bodies upon one another are for the moſt part ſit not all] immediately performd by their Qualities or Accidents, it would Tcarce be poſſible to explicate very many of the explicable Phænomena of Naturè, without having recourſe to Them; and it would be ſtrange, if many of the abſtruſer Phænomena were not explicable by them onely. Whereas indeed almoſt all the rational Accounts to be met with oſ difficult Phænomena, arc given by ſuch as either do not acknoledge, or at leaſt do not rate notice of ſubſtantial Forms. Andtis evident by the clear Solutions (untouc'd by many vulgar Philoſophers,) we meet with of many Phænomena in the Statichs, and other parts of the Mechanicks, and eſpecially in the Hydroſtatichs, and Pneumaticks, how clearly many Phæanomona may be ſolvd, without imploying a ſubſtantial Form. And on the other ſide, I do not remember, that either Ariſtotle himſelf, (who perhaps ſcarce ever attempted it,) or any of his Followers, has given a ſolid and intelligible ſolution of any one Phænomenon of Nature by the help of ſubſtantial Forms; which you need not think it ſtrange Iſhould ſay, ſince the greateſt Patrons of Forms acknowledg their Nature tobe * unknown to Us, to explain any. Eſfect by a ſubſtantial Form, muſt be to declare (as they ſpeak) ignotum per ignotius, or at leaſt per æquè ignotum. And indeed to explicate a Phæanomenon, being to deduce it from ſomething elſe in Nature more known to Us, then the thing to be explaind by It, how can the imploying of Incomprehenſible (or at leaſt Uncomprehended) ſubſtantiat Forms help Us to explain intelligibly This or  Nommna tu lapidis, qui quotidic tuis oculis obſervatur, formam; & Phyllida ſolus habeto. Scal. contræ Card. That particular Phænomenon? For to ſay, that ſuch an Effect proceeds nor ſrom this or that Quality of the Agent. but from its ſubſtantial Form, is to take an eaſie way to reſolve all difficulties in general, without rightly reſolving any one in particular; and would make a rare Philoſo phy, if it were not far more eaſie then ſatisfactory: for ifit be demandeqd, why Jet attracts Stras, Rhubarb purges Choller, Snow dazles the Eyes rather then Graſſe, &c. to ſay, that theſe and the like Effects are performd by the ſubſtantial Forms of the reſpective Bodies, is at beſt but to tell me, what is the Agent, not how the Effect is wrought, and ſeems to be but ſuch a kind of general way of anſwering, as ]eaves the curious Enquirer as much to ſeek for the cauſes and manner of particular Things, as Men commonly are for the particular cauſes of the ſeveral ſtrang Things performd by Witchcraſt, though they be told, that tis ſome Dilill vel that does them all. Wherefore Ido not think, but that Nutural Philoſophy, without being tor That the more Defective, may well enough ſpare the Doctrine of Subſtantial Forms as an uſeleſs Theory; not that Men are yvet arrivd to be able to explicate all the Phænomena of Nature without them, but be. cauſe, whatever we cannot explicate without them, we cannot neither intelligibly explicate by them. And thus, Pyrophilus, I have offer'd You ſome of thoſe mãny things, that indiſpoſd me to acquieſce in the receivd Doctrine oſ Subſtantial Forms: but in caſe any more piercing Enquirer ſhall perſwade himſelf, that he underſtands it throughly, and can explicate iĩt clearly, Iſhall congratulate him for luch happy Intellectuals, and be very read; to be informd by him. But ſince what the. Schools are wont to teach of the Origine and Attributes of ſubſtantial nòt yet comprehend; and ſince Ihave ſome of the eminenteſt Perſons among the Modern Philoſophers to joine with me, though perhaps not for the ſame Conſiderations, in the like confeſſion, thiat tis not neceſſary the Reaſon of my not finding this Doctrine conceivable, muſt be rathe? a Defectiveneſs in my Lnderſtanding, then the unconceivable nature of the thing it ſelſ: I, who love not ſin matters purely Philoſophical)to acquieſce in what Ido not underſtand, nor to go about to explicate thingsto others, by what appèars to me it ſelt.inex plicable, ſhall, I hope, be excuſſqd, if, leaving thoſe that contend for them, the liberty of making what uſe they can of ſubſtantial Forms, Ido, till I be better ſatisſied, decline imploying them my ſelf, and endeavour to ſolve thoſe Phænomena, I attempt to give an account of, without them, as not ſcrupling to confeſs, that thoſe that I cannot explicate, at leaſt in a general way, by intelligible principles, principles, I am not yet arriv'd to the diſtinct and particular knowledg of. Now for our Doctrine touching the Origine of Forms, it will not,be diſſicult to collect it from what we formerly diſcourſd about Qualities and Forms together: for the Form of a Natural Body, being according to us, but an Eſſential Modification, and, as it were, the Stamp of its Matter, or ſuch a convention of rhe Bigneſs, Shape, Motion (or Reſt,) Scituation and Contexture, (together with the thence reſulting Qualities) of the ſmall parts that compoſe the Body, as is neceſſary to conſtitute and denominate ſuch a particular Body; and all theſe Accidents being producible in Matter by Local Motion, tis agreeable to our Hypotheſis to ſay, That the ſirſt and Univerſal, though not immediate cauſe of Forms is none other but God, who pæt Matter into Motion, (which belongs not to its Eſſence,) and Establiſa the Laws of Motion amongiſt Bodies, and alſo, according to my Opinion, guided it in divers caſes at the heginning of Things, and that, among Second Cauſes, the Grand Eſficient of Forms is Local Motion, which by variouſly d viding, ſequeſtring, tranſpoſing, and ſo connecting the parts of Matter, produces in them thoſe Accidents and Qualities, upon whoſe account the portion of Matter thev diverſifie comes to belong to this or that determinate ſpecies of Natural Bodies, which yet is not ſo to be underſtood, as if Motion were onely an Efficient cauſe in the Generation of Bodies, but very often (as in water, fire, &c.) tis alſo one ofthe chiefe Accidents, that concurre to make up the Form. IEE lll But in this laſt Summary Account of the Origine of Forms, I think my ſelf oblig]d to declare to you a little more diſtinctly, what Ijuſt now intimated to be my own Opinion. Anã this Iſhall do, by advertiſing you, that thoughl agree with our Epicureans, in thinking it probable, tha: the World is made up of an innumerable multitude of ſingly inſenſible Corpuſcles, endowd with their own Sizes, Shapes, and Motions; and though Iagree with the Carte ſians, in believing ſas Ifind that* 4naxagoras did of Old,) that Matter hath not its Motion from its ſelf, but Originally from God; yet in This I diſler both from Epicurus and Des Cartes, that, whereas the former of them plainly denies, that the World was made by any Deity, (for Deities he ownd,) and the Latter of them, for ought I can ſind in his Writings, or thoſe of lome of his Eminenteſt Diſciples, thought, that God, having once put Matter into Motion, and eſtabliſd the Laws of that Motion, needed not more particularly * Ariſiotle ſpeaking of Anaragoras in the firt Ch. of the laſt Book of his Phyſicks, hath this palſlage: Dicit (Auaxagoras) cim omnia ſimul eſſent, alque queſcerert temporc infinito, Mntem moviſſe, ac ſegregaſſe. interpoſe for the Production of Things Corporeal, nor even of Plants or Animals, which according to him are but Engines: Ido not at all believe, that either theſe Carteſian Laws of Motion, or the Epicurean caſual Concourſe of Atoms, could bring meer Matter into ſo orderly and well contrivd a Fabrick as This World; and therefore Ithinl, that the wiſe Author of Nature did not onely put Matter into Motion, but when he reſolv]d to make the World, did ſoregulate and guide the Motions of the ſmall parts of the Univerſal Matter, as to reduce the greater Syſtems of them into the Order they were to continue in; and did more particularly contrive ſome portions of that Matter into Seminal Rudiments or Principles, lodgſd in convenient Receptacles, (and as it were Wombs, )and others into the Bodies of Plants and Animals: one main part of whoſe Contrivance, did, as I apprehend, gans were ſo framd, that, ſuppoſing the Fabrick of the greater Bodies ofthe Univerſe, and the Lans he had eſtabliſd in Nature, ſome Juicy and Spirituous parts of theſe living Creatures muſt be fit to be turn'd into Prolifick Seeds, whereby they may have a power, by generating their like, to propagate their Species. SO thot according to my ⸗pprehenſion, it was at 1he beginning neceſſary, that an Intelligent and Wiſe Agent ſhould contrive the Univerſl Matter into the World, (and eſpecially ſome Portions of it into Seminal Organs and Principles,] and ſettle the Laws, according to which the Motions and Actions of ĩts parts upon one another ſhould be regulated: withoꝶt which interpoſition of the Worlds Architect, however moving ratter may with ſome probability (tor I ſee not inthe Notion any Certainty) be conceivd to be able, after numberleſs Occurſions of itsinſenſible parts, to caſt it ſelt into ſuch grand Conventions and Convolutions, as the Carteſians call Vortices, and as, I remember, Epicur us ſpeaks of under the name of eœæims, ꝗ́ dvi;3 Yt think it utterly improbable, that brute and unguided, though moving, Matter, ſhould ever convene into ſuch admirable Structures, as the Bodies of perfect Animalss But the World being once framd, and the courſe oſ Nature eſtabliſæd, the Naturaliſt, (except in ſome few caſes, where God, or Incorporeal Agents interpoſe,) has recourſe to the firſt Cauſe but for its general and ordinary Support and Influence, wherebyit preſerves Matter and Motion from Annihilation or Deſition; and in explicating particular Phanomena, conſiders onely the size, Shape, Motion, ſor want of it) Texture, and the reſulting Qualities and Attributes of the ſmall particles of Matter. And thus in this great Automaton the World, ſas ina Watch  Epicurus in his Epiſtie to Pythocles. lll ll or Clock,) the Materials it conſiſts of, being left to themſelves, could never at the firſt convene into ſo curious an Engine: and yet, when the skilful Artiſt has once made and ſet it a going, the Phænomena it exhibits are to be accounted for by the number, bigneſſe, proportion, ſape, motion, (or endeavour,) reſt, coaptation, and other Mechanical Affections of the Spring, Wheels, Pillars, and other parts it is made up of: and thoſe effects of ſuch a Watch, that cannot this way be explicated, muſt, for ought Iyet know, be confeſſd, not to be ſufficiently underſtood. But to return thither, whence my Duty to the Author of Nature oblig]d me, to make this ſhort Digreſſion. The hitherto propoſd Hypotheſis, touching the Origination of Forms, hath, I hope, been rendred probable by divers particulars in the paſt Diſcourſes, and ill be both exemplify'd and confirmd by lome of the Experiments, that make the Latter part of this preſent Treatiſe, (eſpecially the Fifth and 2h of them,) which, containing Experiments of the Changing the Form of a Salt and a Mettal, do chieſly belong to the Hiſtorical or Experimental part of what we deliver touching the Origine of Forms. And indeed, beſides the two hinds of Experiments preſently to be mention'd, we might here preſent vou a Third ſort, conſiſting partly of divers Relations of Metalline Tranimutations, deliver'd upon their own Credit by Credible men, that are not Alchymiſts; and partly of lome Experiments (ſome made, ſome directed by us) of Changing both Bodies, totally inſlammable, almoſt totally into water, and a good part evn of diſtilld Rain mater without Additament into Earth; and diſtill'd Liquors, readily and totally mingleable with Water, pro parte into a true oyle, that will not mix withit. This ſort of Experiments, I ſay, Imight here anney, if I thought ſit, in this place, either to lay any ſtreſſe upon thoſe, that I cannot my ſelf make out, or to tranſfer hither thoſe Experiments of Changes amongſt Bodies not Metalline, that belong to another * Treatiſe. But over and above, what the paſt Notes and the Experiments, that are to follow them, contain towards the making of what we teach concerning Forms, we will here, for further Confirmation, proceed to adde two ſorts of Experiments, (beſides the Third already mentiond.) The one, wherein it appears, that Bodies of very differing Natures, being put together, like the Wheels, and other peices of a Watch, and by their connection acquiring a new Texture, and ſo new Qualities, may, without having recourſe to a ſubſtantial Form, compoſe ſucha new Concrete, as may as well deſerve to have a ſubſtantial Form attributed to it, by virtue of that new Diſæ The Sceptical Chymiſt. poſition of its parts, às other Bodies that are ſaid to be endowd therewith. And the other, that a Natural Body being diſſipated, and as it were taen in peices, like a Watch, may have its parts ſo aſſociated, as to conſtitute New Bodies, of Natures very differing from its own, and from each other, and yet theſe diſſipated and ſcatterd parts, by being recollected and put together again, like the pieces of a Watch, inthe like order as before, may recompoſe (almoſt, if not more then almoſt) ſuch another Body, as that they made up, before they were taken aſunder. li ;vm aròt : à Bòũũã I. EXPERIMENTS, and THOuG HTS, about the Production and Reproduction of FORMES. ll was not at randome, that I ſpoke, when, in the foregoing Notes about the Origine of Qualities, I intimated, That twas very much by a kind of tacit agreement, that Men had diſtinguiſd the Species of Bodies, and that thoſe Diſtinctions were more Arbitrary then we are wont to be aware of. For Iconfeſſe, that I have not vet, either in riſtotle, or any other Writer, met with any genuine and ſufficient Diagnoſtick and Boundary, for the Diſcriminating and limiting the species of Things, or to ſpeak more plainly, I have not found, that any Naturaliſt has laid down a determinate Number and ſort of Qualities, or other Attributes, which is ſufficient and neceſſary to conſtitute all portions of Matter, endowd with them, diſtinct Kinds of Natural Bodies. And therefore I obſerve, that moſt commonly Men look upon theſe as Dis ſtinct species of Bodies, that have had the luck to have diſtinct Names found out for them; though perhaps diverſe of them differ much leſſe from one another, then other Bodies, which (becauſe they have been hudled up under one Nãme,) have been lookd upon, as but one ſort of Bodies. But not to lay any weight on this Intimation about Names, I found, that for want of a true Characteriſtick, or diſcriminating notes, it hath been, and is ſtill, both very uncertain as to divers Bodies, whether they are oſ different Spesies or of the ſame, and very difficult to give a ſufficient rea: ſon, why divers Bodies, wherein Nature is aſſiſted by Art, ſhould not as well paſs for diſtinct kinds of Bodies, as others, that are generally reckond to be ſo. Whether or inſtancel Water and Ice be not to be eſteemd diſtinct kinds of Bodies, is ſo little evident, that ſome, that pretend to be very well verſd in Ariſtotles Writings and Opinions, affirme him to teach, that Water looſes not its own nature by being turnd into Ice; and indeed I remember Ihave read a* Text of his, that ſeems expreſs enough to this purpoſe, and the thing it ſelf is made plauſible by the reducibleneſſe of Ice back again into Water. And vet I remember, Galen is affirmd to make theſe two, diſtinct species of Bo* See Lib. 1.de Gen. & Cor. t.30. Idem Corpus(ſayes he there) quanquam continuum, aliãs liquidum, alits concretum videmus, non diviſione aut compo ſitione Loc pafſum, aut converſione, aut attactu, ſicuti Democritus aſyerit: nam neque tranſpoſitione, neque Naturæ demutatione ( 7b u⸗e5æ r 7ũ⸗ ęu'ęu) ex liquido concietum evadere ſolet. dies; which Doctrine is favour'd by the differing Qualities of Ice and Water, for not onely the one is fluid, and the other ſolid, and even brittle, but Ice is alſo commonly more or leſs opacous in compariſon of Water, being alſo lighter then it in ſpecie, ſince it ſwims upon it. TO which may be added, that Ice. beaten with common Salt, will freeæ other Bodies, when Water mingled with Salt will not. And on this occaſion, I would propoſe to be reſolv/q, whether Muſt, Wine, Spirit of Wine, Vinegar, Tartar, and Vappa, be Specifically diſtinct Bodies? and the like queſtion I would ask concerning a Hens Egg, and the Chick that is afterwards hatc'd out of it: As alſo concerning Wood, Aſhes, Soot, and likewiſe the Eggs of Silkworms, which are firſt ſmall Caterpillars, or ſas ſome think them) but Worms, when they are newly hatcd, and then Aurelias, (or husked Maggots,) and then Butterſlies, Which I have obſervd with pleaſure to be the ſucce ſſive Production of the Prolifick Seed of Silkworms. And whether the Anſwer to theſe Quæries bæ Affirmative or Negative, I doubt the reaſon, that will be given for either of the two, will not hold in divers caſes, whereto I might apply itt And a more puzling Queſtion it may be to ſome, whether a Char. coal, being throughly kindled, do ſpecifically differ from another Charcoal? for, according to thoſe I argue with, the fire has penetrated it quite through, and therefore ſome of the recent Ariſtotelians are ſo convincd of its being tranſmuted, that all the ſatisfaction I could find from a very ſubtle modern Schoolman to the Objection, That if the glowing Coal were plung'd into Water, it would be a black Coal agen, was, That notwithſtanding That reduction, the Form of a Charcoal had been once aboliſvd by the ſire, and was reproduc'd by God, upon the regain'd Diſpoſition oſthe Matter to receive it. Nor is it very eaſie to determine, whether Clouds, and Rain, and Hail, and Snow, be bodies ſpeciſically diſtinct from Water, and fiom each other, and the writers of Meteors are wont to handle them as diſtinct. And ſince if ſuch ſlight differences as thoſe, that diſcriminate theſe Bodies, or that which diſtinguiſhes Wind from Exhalations, whoſe Courſe makes it, be ſufficient to conſtitute differing kinds of Bodies, twill be hard to give a ſatisfactory Reaſon, why other Bodies, that differ in more or more conſiderable particulars, ſhould not enjoy the ſame Priviledge. And I preſume, that Sno diſters leſs from Rain, then Paper doth from Rags, or Glaſs made of Wood- aſhes does from Wood. And indeed, Men having, by tacit conſent, agreed to look upon Paper, and Glaſs, and Soape, and Sugar, and Braſs, and Ink, and Pewter, and Gunpowder, and ſtinct ſorts of Bodies, I ſee not, why they may not be thought to have doue it, on as good grounds, as thoſe, upon which divers other diftering Species of Bodies have been conſtituted Nor will it ſuffice to object, that theſe Bodies are ſatitious; for tis the preſent nature of Bodies, that ought to be conſiderd in referring them to Species, which way ſoever they came by that Nature: for Salt, that is, in many Countries, made by boiling Sea water in Cauldrons, and other veſſels, is as well true Sea- ſalt, as that which is made in the Iſle of man, ſas Navigators call it,) without any cooperation of Man, by the bare action of the Sun upon thoſe parts of the Sea water, which chance to be left behind in hollow places, after a high Spring- tide. And Silk- worms, which will hatch by the heat of humane Bodies, and Chickens, that are hatch'd in ægypt by the heat of Ovens or Dunghils, are no leſs true Silk- worms or Chickens, then thoſe that are hatclvd by the Sun, or by Hens. As for what may be objected, that we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt Factitious Bodies and Natural, I will not now ſtay to examine, how far that Diſtinction may be allow'd: for it may ſuffice for our preſent purpoſe to repreſent, that whatever may be ſaid of Factitious Bodies, where Man does, by Inſtruments of his own providing, onely give Figure, or alſo Contexture to the ſenſible (not inſenſible) parts of the Matter he works upon; as when a Joyner makes a Stool, or a Statuary makes an Image, or a Turner a Bowl: yet the caſe may be very differing in thoſe other factitious Productions, wherein the inſenſible parts of Matter are alterd by Natural Agents, who perform the greateſt part of the work among themſelves, thoughthe Artificer be an Aſſiſtant, by putting Them together after a due manner. And therefore Iknow not, why all the Proll ductions oſ the Fire made by Chymiſis ſnould be look'd upon, as not Natural, bur Artificial Bodies: ſince the Fire. which ĩis the grand Agent in theſe Changes, doth not, by being imployd by the Chymiſt, ceaſe to be, and to work as, a Natural Agent: And ſince Nature her ſelf doth, by the help of the fire, ſometimes afford us the like Productions that the Alchymiſũts art preſents us: as in ætna, Veſuvius, and other burning Mountains, (ſome oi whoſe Productions I can ſhew you,) Stones are ſometimes turnd into Lime, (and ſo an Alcalizate Salt is produc'd,) and ſometimes, ifthey be more diſpoſd to be flux' d, then calcin'd, brought to vitrification; Metalline and Mineral Bodies are by the violence of the fire colliquated into Maſſes of very ſtrange and compounded Natures. Aſhes and Metalline flowers of divers kinds are ſcat. terd about the neighbouring places, and copious flowers of Sulphur, ſublimd by the internal fire, have been ſeveral times found about the Vents, at which the Fumes are diſcharg'd into the Air: (As Ihave been aſſur'd by Ingenious Viſiters of ſuch Places, whom I purpoſely inquir'd of, touching theſe fſores; for of theſe Travellers more then one anſwer d me, they had themſelves gatherd, and had brought ſome very good.) Not to adde, that I have ſometimes ſuſpected, upon no abſurd grounds, that divers of the Minerals and other Bodies, we meet with in the Jower parts of the Earth, and think to have been formed and lodg⸗d there ever ſince the beginning of Things, have been ſince producd there by the help of ſubterraneal fires, or other heats, which may either by their immediate action, and ex. ceedingly long application, very much alter ſome Bodies by changing their Texture; as when Lead is turn'd into Minium, and Tin into Putty by the operation of the fire ina few hours, or by elevating, in the form of Exhalations or Vapours, divers Saline and Sulphureous Corpuſcles or Particles of unripe (orto uſe a Chymical Term of Art) Embrionated Mmerals, and perhaps Mettals, which may very much alter the Nature, and thereby vary the Kind of other ſubterraneal Bodies, which they pervade, and in which they often come to be incorporated; or elſe may, by convening among themſelves, conſtitute particular Concretions, as wee ſee that the fumes of Sulphur and thoſe of Mercury unite into that Lovely red Maſs, which in the Shops they call Vermilion, and which is ſo like to the Mineral, whence we uſually obtain Mercury, that the Latines give them both the ſame Name Cinnabaris, and in that ere imitated by the French and italians; in whoſe favour Iſhall adde, That if we ſuppoſe this Mineral to conſiſt of a ſton/ Concretion, penetrated by ſuch Mine. ral fumes as I have been ſpeaking of, the Appellation may be better excuſd then perhaps you ima gine, ſince ſfrom Cinnabaris nativa not onely Iobtaind a conſiderable quantity of good running Mercury, (whichis That, Men are wont to ſeek for from it,) but to gratifie my Curioſity ſomewhat turther, Itryd an eaſie way, that came into my mind, whereby the caput mortuum afforded me no deſpicable Quantity of good combuſtible Sulphur. But this upon the By, being not obligſ] to ſet down here the grounds of my Paradoxical Conjecture about the Effects of ſubterraneal Fires and Heats, ſince Ihere lay no ſtreſs upon it, but retun to what I was ſaying about ætna, and other Volcans:. Since then theſe Productions of the Fire, being of Nature’s own make. ing, cannot be deny’d to be Natnral Bodies, ] ſee not why the like Productions of the Fire ſhould be thought unworthy that Name, onely becauſe thè Fire, that made the former, was hinde led by chance in a Hill, and that which producd the latter was kindled by a Man in a Furnace. And if flower of Sulphur, Lime, Glaſs, and colliquated mixtures of Metals and Minerals are to be reclkond among Natural Bodies, it ſeems to be but reaſonable, that, upon the ſame grounds, we ſhould admit flower of Antimony, Lime, and Glaſs, and Pewter, and Braſs, and many other Chymical Concretes, (if I may ſo call them) to be taken into the ſame number; and then twill be evident, that to diſtinguiſh the ſpecies of Natural Bodies, a Concourſe of Accidents will, without conſidering any Subſtantial Form, be ſufficient. But becauſe I need not, on this occaſion, have recourſe to inſtances of a diſputable nature, I will pitch, for the illuſtration of the Mechanical Production of Forms, upon Vitriol. For ſince Nature her ſelf, without the help of Art, does oftentimes produce that Concrete, (as Ihave elſewhere ſnewn by Experience,) there is no reaſon why Vitriol, produc'd by eaſie Chymical Operations, ſhould not be look'd upon as a Body of the ſame Nature and Kind. And in Factitious Vitriol, our knowing what Ingredients ve make uſe of, and how we put them together, inables us to judge very well, how Vitriol is produc'd. But becauſe it is wont to be reckon'd with Salt- petre, Sea- ſalt, and Sal Gem among true Salts, Ithinki it requiſite to take notice in the firſt place, that Vitriol is not a meer Salt, but That, which Paracelſus ſomewhere, and after him divers other Spagyriſts, call a Magiſtery, which in their ſenſe (for there are that uſe it in another,) commonly ſignifies a Preparation, wherein the Body to be prepard has not its Principles ſeparated, as in Diſtillation, Incineration, &c. but wherein the whole Bodj is brought into another form, by the addition of ſome Salt or Menſtruum, that is united per minima withit. And agreeably to this Notion we find, that from common Vitriol, whether native or factitious, may be obtãin'd (by Diſtil]ation and Reduction) an acid Saline Spirit, and a Metalline Subſtance, as I elſewhere mention, that from blew Vitriol, Copper may be (by more then one way) ſeparated. And Ithe rather give this Advertiſement, becauſe that as there is a Vitriol of Iron, which is uſually green, and another of Copper, which is wont to be blew; and alſoa white Vitriol, about which it is diſputed what it holds, (though that it holds ſome Copper I have found;) andyet all oſ theſe are without ſcruple reputed true Vitriols, notwithſtanding that they diſfer ſo much in Colour, and (as I have diſcover d) in ſeveral other Qualities; ſo I ſee no reaſon, why the other Minerals, being reduc'd by their proper Menſtruums into Salt like Magiſteries, may not paſę for the Vitriols of thoſe Metals, und conſequently for Natural Bodies: which, if granted, will adde ſome confirmation to our Doctrine, though its being granted is not neceſſary to make it out. For, to confine our ſelves to Vitriol, tis known among Chymiſts, that if upon the filings of Mars one puta convenient quantity of that acid diſtill'd Liquor, which is (abuſively) wont to be call'd Oyl of Vitriol, diluting the mixture with Rain, or with common Water, tis eaſie by Filtrating the Solution, by Evaporating the Aqueous ſuperſluity ofit, and by leaving the reſt for a competent while in a Cellar, (or other cold place) to Chriſtallize, tis eaſie, I ſay, by this means to obtain a Vitriol of Iron; which agrees with the other Vitriol of Vitriol- ſtones or Mãrchaſites, preſented us, by Nature, without the help of any other Menſtruum, then the Rain that falls upon them from the Clouds, in I know not how many Qualities, part Obvious, and part of them Occult: As, (of the ſfir?? ſort) in Colour, Tranſparency, Brittleneſſe, eaſineſs of Fuſion, Styptical Taſt, reducibleneſs to a Red Powder by Calcination, and other Qualities more obvious to be taken notice of; to which may be annexd divers Qualities of the ſecond ſort, (I mean the more abſtruſe ones,) as the power to turn in a trice an Infuſion of Gulls, made in ordinary water, (as alſo to turna certain clear Mineral Solution, elſewhere mentiond,] into an Inckly colour, to which, in all probability, we may adde a faculty of cauſing Vomits even ina ſmall Doſe, when taken into the Stomach of a Man, and that remarkable property of being endowd with as exact and curious a ſhape or figure, as Thoſe, for which Salts have been, by modern Philoſophers eſpecially, ſo much admir'd. But, that no ſcruple might ariſe from hence, that in the Vitriolum Martis, wont to be made by Chymiſts, the Menſtruum, lll Q 3 that that is imployd, is the Oyl of common Vitriol, which may be ſuſpected to have retaid the nature of the Concrete whence it proceeded, and ſo this Factitious Vitriol may not be barely a new Production, but partly a Recorporification, as they ſpeak, of the Vitriolate Corpuſcles containd in the Menſtruum: To prevent this Scruple 1 ſay, (Which vet perhaps would not much trouble a Conſidering Chymiſt,) Ithought fit to imploy a quite other Menſtruum, that would not be ſuſpected to have any thing of Vitriol in it. And though Aqua fortis, and Spirit of Nitre, however they corrode Mars, are unfit for ſuch a work; yet having pitchvd upon Spirit oſ Salt inſtead of Oyl of Vitriol, and proceeding the ſame way that has been already ſet down, it anſwer'd our Ex pectation, and afforded us a good green Vitriol. Nor will the great diſpoſition, Ihave obſervd in this our Vitriol, to reſolve, by the moiſture of the Air, into à Liquor, make it eſſentially differing from other Vitriols, ſince it has been obſervd, and particularly by Guntherus Belichius more then once, that even the common Vitriol he uſd in Germany, villalſo, though not ſo eaſily as other Salts, run (as the Chymiſts phraſe it) per deliquium. And to make the Experiment more compleat, though we did not find either Oyl of Vitriol, or Spirit of Salt, good Menſtruums to make a blew Venereal Vitriol out of Copper, (however fil'd, or thinly laminated,) and though upon more Tryals then one, it appear'd, that Aqua fortis, & Spirit of Nitre, which we thought ſit to ſubſtitute to the above mention'd Liquors, did indeed make a Solution of Copper, but ſo unctuous a one, that twas very hard to bring any part of it to dryneſſe, without ſpoyling the Colour and Shape of the deſir'd Body: yet repeating the Experiment with care and watchfulneſs, we, this way, obtain'd one of the lovelieſt Vitriols that hath perhãps been ſeen, and of which you your ſelf may be the judg by a parcel ofit Ikeep by me for a Rarity. To apply now theſe Experiments, eſpecially That, wherein Spirit of Salt is imployd, to the purpoſe, for whichlI have mentiond them, let us briefly conſider theſe two things; the one, that our Factitious Vitriol is a Body, that, as well as the Natural, is endow'd with many Qualities, (manifeſt, and occult,) not onely ſuch as are common to it with other Salts, as Tranſparency, Brittleneſs, Solubleneſſe in Water, &c. but ſuch as are Properties peculiar to it, as Greenneſs, eaſineſs of Fuſion, Stypticity of Taſt, a peculiar Shape, a power to ſtrike a Black with infuſion of Galls, an Emetick faculty, &c. The other thing we are to conſider i5, that though theſe Qualities are in common Vitriol believ'd to flow from the ſubſtantial Form of the Concrete, and may, 3s juſtly as the Qualities, whe⸗ ther manifeſt or occult, of other Inanimate Bodies, be imployd as Arguments to evince ſuch a Form: yet in our Vitriol, made with Spirit of Salt, the ſame Qualities and Properties were producd by the aſſociating and juxtapoſition of the two Ingredients, of which the Vi. triol was compounded, the Myſtery being no more but this, That the Steel being diſſolvd in the Spirit, the Saline Particles of the former, and the Metalline ones of the latter, having each their Determinate Shopes, did by their Aſſociation compoſe divers Corpuſcles ofa mixd or compounded Nature, from the Convention of many whereof, there reſulted a new Body, of ſucha Texture, as qualify'd it to affect our Senſories, and worl upon other Bodies, aſter ſuch a manner às common Vitriol is wont to do., And indeed in our caſe,. not onely it cannot be made appear, that there is any ſubſtantial Form generated anew, but that there is not ſo much as an exquiſite mixture, according to the common Notion the Schools have of ſuch a Mixture For Both the Ingredients retain their Nature, (though perhaps ſomewhat alterd,) ſo that there is, as we were ſaying, but a Juxta- poſition of the Metalline and Saline Corpuſces; onely they are aſſociated ſo, as by the mannner of their Coalition to ãcquire that new Texture, which Denominates the Magiſtery they compoſe, Vitriol. For tis evident, that the Saline Ingredient may either totally, or for much the greateſt part be ſeparated by Diſtillation, the Metalline remaining behind. Nay ſome of the Qualities, we have been aſcribing to our Vitriol, do ſo much depend upon Texture, that the very Beams of the Sun ſconverg'd) will, as IThave purpoſely tryd, very eaſily alter its Colour, as well as ſpoyl its Tranſparency, turning it at firſt from Green to White, and, if they be conlll centerd by a good Burning glaſs, makeing it change that Livery fora deep Red⸗ Doubts and Experiments, touehing the Curious Figures of SALTS. Nd here let me take notice, that though the exact and curious Figures, in which Vitriol and other Salts are wont to ſhoot, be made Arguments of the Preſence, and great Inſtances of the Plaſtict skill of ſubſtantial Forms and Seminal Powers, yet, I confeſs, I am not ſo fully ſatisfied in this matter, as even the Modern Philoſophers appear to bee Tis not that I deny, that Platos excellent Saving, umæ ò O: mav be apply d to theſe exquiſite Productions of Nature: For though God has thought fit to make things Corporeal aſter a much more facile and intelligible way, then by the intervention of ſtick power of Seeds, which in Plants ænd Animals I willingly admit, ſeem not in our caſe to be needful; yet is the Divine Architect's Geometry (if I may ſo call it)nevertheleſſe to be acknowledgd and admir'd, for having been pleaſqd to make the primary and inſenſible Corpuſcles oſ Salts and Metals of ſuch determinate, curious, and exact Shapes, that, as they happen to be aſſociated together, they ſhould naturally produce Concretions, which, though differiugly figurd according to the reſpective Natures of their Ingredients, and the various manners of their Convening, ſhould yet be all of them very curious, and ſeem elaborate in their Kinds. How little Ithink it fit to be allowd, that the Bodies of Animals, which conſiſt of ſo many curiouſly framd and wonderſully adapted Organical parts, (and whoſe Structure is a thouſand times more Artificial then that of Salts, and Stones, and other Minerals,) can be reaſonably ſuppoſ d to have been producd by Chance, or without the Guidance of an Intelligent Author of Things, Ihave elſewhere largely declard- Bur I confeſs, Ilook upon theſe Figures we admire in Salts, and in ſome kinds of Stones, (which Ihave not been Incurious to collect,) as Textures ſo ſimple and ſlight in compariſon of the Bodies of Animals, & oftentimes in compariſon of ſome one Organical part, that I think it cannot be in the leaſt inferrd, that beęcauſe ſuch ſlight Eigurations need not be aſcrib]d to the Plaſtick power of Seeds, it is not neceſſary, that the ſtupendious and incomparably more elaborate Fabrick and ſtructure of Animals themſelves ſhould be ſo. And this premiſtd, I ſhall adde, that I have been inclid to the Conjecture about the ſhapes of Salts, that I lately propoſd, by theſe Conſiderations. Firſt, That by a bare Aſſociation of Metalline and Saline Corpuſcles, a Con. crete, as ſinely ſigurd ãs other Vitriols, may be produc'd, as we have lately ſeen. Secondly, becauſe that the Figures of theſe Salts are not conſtantly in all reſpects the ſame, but may in diverſe manners be ſomewhat varied, as they happen to be made to ſhoot more haſtily, or more leiſurely, and as they ſhoot in a ſcanter, or in a fuller proportion of Liquor. This may be eaſily obſervęl by any, that will but with a little Atten. tion conſider the difference that may be found in Vitriolate Chriſtals or Grains, when quantities of them were taken out of the great Coolers, as they call them, wherein that Salt, at the Works where tis boyld, is wont to be ſet to ſhoot. And accordingly, where the Experienc'd Mineraliſt Agricola, deſcribes the ſeveral wayes of making Vitriol in great Quantſties, he does not onely more then once call the great Grains or Chriſtals, into which it coagulates, Cubes; but ſpeaking of the manner of caeir Concretion about the Cords or Ropes, that are wont (in Germany) to be hang'd drom certain croſs Bars into the Vitriolate Water or Solution for the Vitriol to faſten its ſelf to, he compares the Concretions indifferently to Cubes or Cluſters of Grapes: Ex his (ſayes he, ſpealing of the croſs Bars,) pendent reſtes lapillis extentæ, ad quos humor ſpiſſus adhæareſcens denſatur in tranſlucentes atramenti ſutorii vel Cubos, vel Acinos, qui uvæ ſpeciem gerunt, Iremember alſo, that having many years ſince a ſuſpicion, that the Reaſon why Aſtalys, ſuch as Salt of Tartar and Pot- aſhes are wont to be obtain'd in èhe form of white Powders or Calces, might be the way, wherein the Water, or the Lixiviums, that contain them, is wont to be drawn off, Ifancied, that by leaving the Saline Corpuſcles a competent quantiof Water to ſvimme in, and allowing them leaſure for ſuch a multitude of æ Guorg: Agricola de e metall. lib. 12.0. 262. Occurſions, as might ſuſfice to make them hit upon more congruous Coalitions then is uſual, I might obtain Chriſtals of Them, as well as of other Salt:: conjecturing this, I ſay, I ceuſd ſome well purifyd altalys, diſſolvd in clear water, to be ſlowly evapurated, till the Top was cover'd with a thin Icelike Cruſt. then taking care not to break That, leaſt they ſhould (as in the ordinary way, where the Water is all forc'd oſf,) want a ſuſſicient ſtock of Liquor, I kept them in a very gentle heat fora good while; and then breaking the above mentioned Ice like Cake, Ihad, as Iwiſhd, divers figured Lumps of Chriſtalline Salt ſhot in the Water, and tranſparent almoſt like white Sugar Candy. I likewiſe remember, that having, on ſeveral occaſions, diſtill’d a certain quantity of Oyl of Vitriol, with a ſtrong Solution of Sea- ſalt, till the remaining due being diſſolvd in fair water, filter'd, and gently evaporated, would ſhoot into Chriſtals, ſometimes of one figure, ſometimes of another, according as the quantity or ſtrength ofthe Oyl of Vitriol and other Subſtances determind. And yet theſe Chriſtals, though ſometimes they would ſhoot into Priſmelike Figures, as Roch'd Petre; and ſometimes into ſhapes more like to Allome or Vitriol; nay though oftentimes the ſame Caput mortuum diſſolv], would in the ſame Glaſs ſnoot into Chriſtals, whereof ſome would be of one ſhape, ſome of another; yet would theſe differing Grains or Clriſtals appear for the moſt part more exquiſitely figurd, then oftentimes Vitriol does. From Spirit of Urine and Spirit of Nitre, when I have ſuffer'd them to remain long together before Coagulati.on, and ree'd the mixture from the ſuperfluous moiſture very ſ=lowly, Ihave ſometimes obtaind ſine long Chriſtals, (ſome of which I can ſhew you) ſo ſhapd, that moſt Beholders would take them for Chriſtals of Salt- petre. And I have likewiſe tryed, that whereas Silver is wont to ſhoot into Plates exceeding thin, almoſt like thoſe of Moſcovia glaſs, when I have diſſolv'd a pretty quantity ofit in 4qua fortis, or ſpirit of Nitre, and ſufferd it to ſhoot very leiſurely, Ihave obtaind Lunar Chiriſtals, (ſeveral ofwhich Ihave yet by me;) whoſe Figure, though ſo pretty as to have given ſome wonder even to an Excelſent Geometrician, is differing enough from that of the thin Plates formerly mention'd; each Chriſtal being compoſd of many ſmall and finely ſhapd Solids, that ſtick ſo. congruouſly to one another, as to have one ſurſace, that appear'd Plain enough, common to them all. Thirdly, that inſenſible Corpuſcles of different, but all of them exquiſite, ſnapes, and endowed with plain as well a5 ſmooth ſides, will conſtitute Bodie⸗ variouſly, but all very ſinely figurd, I have made uſe of ſeveral waies to manifeſt. And firſt, though Harts-horn, Bloud, and Urine, being reſolv'd, and (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) Anali?’d by Diſtillation, may well be ſuppoſd to have their ſubſtantial Forms (if they had any) deſtroyd by the action of the Fire: yet in regard the Saline Particles, they contain, are endowd with ſuch figures as we have been ſpeaking of, hen in the Liquor, that abounds with either of theſe volatile Salts, the diſſolvd Particles do leiſurely ſhoot into Chriſtals, I have divers times obſerv'd, in theſe, many Maſſes, (Iome bigger, and ſome leſs,) whoſe ſurfaces had Plains, ſome of Figures, as to ſenſe exactly Geometrical, and others very curious and pleaſant. And of theſe finely ſhapd Cetiſtals of various ſizes, Ihave pretty ſtore by me. And becauſe (as it may be probably gatherd from the Event) the Saline Corpuſcles of Stillatitious acid liquors, and thoſe of many of the Bodies, they are fitted to diſſolve, have ſuch kind of Figures as we have been ſpeaking of, when the ſolutions of theſe Bodies, upon the receſs of the ſuperſluous moiſture, ſhoot into Chriſtals, theſe, though they will ſometimes be differing enough, according to the particular natures of the diſſolv'd Bodies and the Menſtruum, yet either the Chriſtals themſelves, or their Surfaces, or buth, will oftentimes have fine and exquiſite Figures; as I have tryd by a Menſtruum, wherewith I was able to diſſolve Iome Gems; as alſo with a ſolution of Coral, made with Spirit of Verdigreeſe, to omit other Examples. And for the ſame reaſon, when Itry'd whether the Particles oſ Silver, diſſolvd in 4qua fortis, would not, without Concoagulating with the Salts, convene, upon the Account of their own ſhapes, into little Concretions of ſmooth and ſlat ſurfalil ces, ] found, that having (to afford the Metalline Corpuſcles ſcope to move in) diluted one part of the Solution with a great many parts of diſtill'd Rain water, (for common water will oftentimes make ſuch Solutions become white or turbid,) a Plate of Copper being ſuſpended in the Liquor, and ſufferd to lie quiet there a while, (for it need not be long there would ſettle, all about it, ſarms of little Metalline and Undiaphanous Bodies, ſhining in the water like the ſcales of ſmall Fiſhes, but formd into little Plates extremely thin, with ſurfaces not onely flat, but exceeding gloſſy: and among thoſe, divers of the Iarger were prettily. figurd at the Edges. And as for Gold, its Corpuſcles are ſufficiently diſpoſd to convene with thoſe of fit or congruous Salts into Concretions of determinate Shapes, as I have found in the Chriſtals Iobtuind from Gold diſſolvd in A9ua Regis, and after having been ſufferd to looſe its ſuperſluous moiſture, kept in a cold place: and not onely ſo, but alſo when by a more powerful Menſtruũ I had ſubdivided the Body of Gold into ſuch minute Particles, that they were ſublimable, (ſor That, I can aſſure you, is poſſible,) theſe volatile Particles of Gold, with the Salts, herewith they were elevated, afforded meſſometimes) ſtore of Chriſtals, hich, though not all of them near of the ſame Bigneſs, reſembled one another in their ſhape, which was regular enough, and a very pretty one. But of this more elſewhere. s. Iremember I have alſo long ſince taken pleaſure to diſſolve two or more of thoſe ſaline Bodies, whoſe ſnapes we know already, in fair Water, that by a very gentle Evaporation I might obtain Concretions, whoſe Shapes ſhould be, though curious, yet differing from the Figure of either of the Ingredients. But we muſt not expect, that, in all caſes, the Salts diſſolv-d together ſhould be rorally compounded: for oftentimes they are of ſuch different Natures, that one will ſhoot much ſooner then another, and then it frequently happens, that a good Proportion of that will be firſt ChriſtalliZ'd in its own ſhape: as is conſpicuouſly to be obſerv'd in the refining of that impure Petre, (which, from the Country that affords it, the Purifiers call Barbary Nitre,) from the common Salt it abounds with: and lſo) as Agricola obſerves,* that in ſome caſes, where a Vitriolate Matter is mingled with that, whichyields Allom, thoſe two Lkinds of Salts will ſhoot ſeparately in the ſame large veſſel, (which the Tryals, ] have made with the compounded Solutions of thoſe two Salts, do not diſcountenance-) No in ſuch caſes, all that can be expected, or needs be deſird, is, that the remaining part of the mixture, or ſome portion of it, àafford Chriſtals, or Grains of compounded ſolid figures.  G. Agricila de re Metallica. lib. 12. li Though the Venetian Borax, wont to be ſold in ſnops, be known to be a factitious Body, compounded of ſeveral Salts, that Iſhall not no ſtay to enumerate; and though, when we buy it, we uſually find it to conſiſt of Lumps and Grains miſhapen enough, yet when I diſſolvd ſome of it in a good quantity of fair water, and made it coagulate very leiſurely, Ihad Chry ſtals, upon whoſe ſurfaces 1 could perceive very exquiſite and, as to ſenſe, regular Geometrical figures. And one thing Imuſt not here by any means prætermit, which is, that though the Caput mortuum of common Aqua fortis conſits of Bodies oſ very differing Natures, (for ſuch are Nitre and Vitriol,) and has been expoſd to a great violence of the Vire, yet I have ſometimes admird the curiouſneſs of thoſe figures, that might be obtaind barely by frequent Solutions and Co⸗gulations of the Saline Particles of this Caput mortuum in fair water. But bell cauſe the Glaſſes, wherein my Concretions were made, were too Iittle to aſford great Chriſtals, and they ought to ſhoot verv ſlowly; I chooſe rather to ſhew the Curious ſome large Chriſtals, which Itook out of the Laboratory of an Ingenious Perſon, who, without minding the Figures, had upon my Recommendation made great quantity of that Salt, in large veſſels, for a Medicine: ſit being the Panacea duplicata, ſo famous in Holſtein.) For divers of theſe Chriſtals have not onely Triangles, Hexagons, and Rhomboids, and other Figures exquiſitely Cut on their ſmooth & ſpecular ſurfaces; and others, Bodies of Priſmatical ſhapes: But ſome of them are no leſs accurately figur'd then the fineſt Nitre or Vitriol I remember my ſelf to have obſervd, and ſome alſo terminate in Bodies almoſt like Pyramids, conſiſting of divers Triangles, that meet in one Vertical point, and are no leſs admirably ſmapd then the fairer ſort of orniſ Diamonds, that have been brought me for Rarities. Beſides, the producing of Salts of new ſhapes, by compounding of Saline Bodies, I have foundit to be practicable not onely in ſome Groſs, or, as they ſpeak, Corporal Salts, ſuch as Sea ſalt, Salt- petre, but alſo in ſome Natural and ſome C hymical Salts diſſolv'd together, and, which perhaps you ill think more conſiderable in ſaline Spirits, made by diſtillation: Not that all of them are fit for this purpoſe, but that I have found divers of thoſe, that work upon one another with Ebullition, to be ſoo For in that Conſlict the Saline Corpuſcles come to be aſſociated to one ànother, and therebv, or by their newly acquir'd figure, whilſt their Coalition laſts, to looſe much of their former Volatility: ſo that, upon Evaporation of the ſuperfluous Liquor, they will not ſly, as otherwiſe they might; but concoagulate into finely ſhapd Chriſtals, as Ihave tryd among other Saline Liquors, with Spirit of Urine, and Spirit of Nitre, and with Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit of fermented Urine with Spirit of Sheeps bloud, and ſpirit of Salt, and alſo with the Spirits of Salt and of Urine; which Laſt Experiment Ithe rather mention, becauſe it ſnews, by the difference of the Chriſtals, aftorded by thoſe two Liquors, from the Chriſtals reſulting from one of them, namely the ſpirit oſ Urine, (or if you pleaſe, the Volatile Salt, wherewith it abounds,) concoagulated with a fit Doſe of Oyl of Vitriol, how much thoſe compounded emergent ſigures de pend upon the more ſimple figures of the ſaline Corpuſcles, that happen to convene into thoſe new Concretes. For the ſpirit of Urine, ſatiated with ſpirit of Salt, and both very gently, and not too far, Evaporated, often afforded me Chriſtals, that differ'd exceedingly in ſhape from thoſe, which I obtain'd from the ſame ſpirit of Urine, ſatiated, eſther with Oyl of Vitriol, or with ſpirit of Nitre For, (to adde That upon the By, )that Salt, compounded of the two Spirits of Urine and of common Salt, is wont to be very prettily figurd, conſiſting of one long Beam as it were, whence on both ſides iſſue out far ſnorter Chriſtals, ſometimes perpendicular to that, àand parallel to one another like the Teeth in a Combe, and ſometimes ſo inclining, as to make the Whole appear almoſt like a Feather; which is the more remarkable, hecauſe I have (many years ago) obſervd, that common Sal Armoniack, that is made of Urine and common Salt, both crude, with a Proportion of Soot, will, if arily diſſolvd, and coagulated, ſhoot into Chriſtals of the like ſhape. How far the unknown Figure of a Salt may Poſſiblv (for Ifear it will not Eaſily) be gheſsd at, by that of the Figure, which it makes with ſome other Salt, whoſe Figure is already known, I leave to to Geometricians to conſider; having, I ſear, inſiſted too long on this ſubject already? Butyet Imuit ãdde one particular more, which will, as well illuſtrate and confirme much of what has been ſoid above touching the Origination of Vitriol, as ſhew, that the Shape of Vitriol depends upon the Textures of the Bodies, whereoſ it is compoſſd. llEl Fourthly then, when I conſiderd, that (as Iformerly noted) Vitriol being but a Magiſtery, made by the concoagulation of the Corpuſcles ofa diſſolvd Metal, with thoſe of the Menſtruum, the Magiſteries of other Metals might, without inconvenience, be added, as other Vitriolate Concretes to the green, the blew, and white Vitriol, that are without ſcruple referr'd to the ſame ſpecies: and when I conſiderd, that Oyl of Vitriol was not a fit Menſtruum to diſſolve divers of the Metals, nor even all thoſe, that it will corrode; and that the like unfitneſę alſo is to be found in common ſpirit of Salt, I pitcd upon Aqua fortis or ſpirit of Nitre, as that Menſtruum, which was likelieſt to afford variety of Vitriols: and accordingly I found, that beſides the Lovely Vitriol of Copper formerly mention'd, that Liquor would with Quickſilver aſtord one ſort of Chriſtals, with Silver another, and with Lead a third; all which Clriſtals oſVitriol, as they differ'd from each other in other Qualities, (upon which ſcore you will find this Experiment elſewhere mentiond,) ſo they did very manifeſtly and conſiderably differ in Shape: the Chriſtais of Silver ſhooting in exceeding thin Plates, and thoſe oſ Lead and Quick- ſilver obtaining figures, though differing enough from cach other, yet of a far greater depth and thickneſs, and leſſe remote from the ſigure of common Vitriol or Sea ſalt: and yvet all theſe Vitriols, eſpecially That of crude Lead, when it was happily made, had Shapes curious and elaborate, as well as thoſe, we admire in common Vitriol or Sea- ſalt. IF then theſe Curious ſhapes, which are believed to be of the admirableſt Eſfects, and of the ſtrongeſt Proofs of ſubſtantial Forms, may be the Reſults oſf Texture, and it Aſt can produce Vitriol its ſelf, as well as Nature, why may we not think, that in ordinary Pbæanomena, that have much leſs of wonder, recourſe is wont to be had to ſubſtantial Forms without any Neceſſity? (Matter, and a Convention of Accidents being able to ſerve the turn without them;) and why ſhould we wiltully exclude thoſe Productions of the Fire, wherein the Chymiſt is but a Servant to Nature, from the number of Natural Bodies? And indeed, ſince there is no certãim Diagnoſtick agreed on, whereby to diſcriminate Notural and Factitious Bodies, and conſtitute the ſpecies of both; ments from the Qualities and Operations of ſeveral oſ thoſe, that are calld Factitious, to ſhew how much may be aſcribd to, and perform'd bv, the Mechanical Characterization or Stamp of Matter: Of which we have a noble Inſtance in Gunpowder, wherein by a bare comminution and blending the Ingredients, Nitre, Chorcoal, and Brimſtone, which have onely a new, and That an exceeding ſlight Contexture, each retaining its own Nature in the Mixture; ſo that there is no colour afforded to the pretence of a ſubſtantial Form, there is producd a new Body, whoſe Operations are more powerful and prodigious, then thoſe of almoſt any Body o? Natures own compounding. And though Glaſs be but an Artificial Concrete, yet, beſides thattis a very noble and uſeful one, Nature her ſelf has produc'd very few, if enough, to make up a Number more laſting and more unalterable. And indeed divers of thoſe factitious Bodies that Chymiſtry is able to afford us, are endow'd with more various and more noble Qualities, then many of thoſe, that are unqueſtionably Natural. And it we admit theſe Productions into the number of Natural Bodies, they will offord us a multitude of Inſtances, to ſhew, that Bodies may acquire many and Noble Qualities, barely by having Mechanical Affections, introduc'd by outward Agents into the Matter, or deſtroy d there. As though Glaſs be ſuch a Noble Body, as we have lately taken notice oſ, yet ſince tis Fuſibility, Tranſparency, and Brittleneſs, that are its onely Conſtituent Attributes, we can in leſs then an hour, (or, perhaps halfe that time,) turn an Opacous Body into Tranſparent Glaſs, without the Addition of any other Viſible Body, by a change oſ Texture, made in the ſame Matter, and by another change of Texture, made without Addition, as formerly, we can, in a trice, reduce Glaſs into, or obtain from it à Body, not Glaſſy, bu Opacous, and otherwiſe of a very differing Nature, as it had been before. And here let me adde what may not a little conduce to our preſent Deſign, That even thoſe, that imbrace Aristotles principles, do unawares conſeſſe, that a ſlight change of Texture, without the introduction of a ſubſtantial Form, may not onely make a Speciſical difference betwixt Bodies, but ſo vaſt a one, that they ſhall have differing Genuses, and mav (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) belong to differing Kingdoms. For Coral, to paſs by all other Plants of that kind, that may be mentiond to the ſame purpoſe, whilſt it grows in the Bottom of the Se⸗, is areal Plant, and ſeveral times (which ſuffices tor my preſent ſcope; hath been there found by an Acquaiotance oſ mine, as well as by other Inquirers, ſoft and tender like another Plant.

A much ſtranger thing may be ſeen in the Eaſt- India Iſland of Sombrero, not very far from Sumatra, iſ. we may believe our Countryman St ſames Lanceſter, who relates it as an Eye witneſſe, for which reaſon, and for the ſtrangene ſs of the thing, I mall adde the ſtory. in his own words.

The Induſtrious Piſo, in his Excellent Hiſtory of Braſil, vouches a multitude of Witneſſes (not having Opportunity to be one himſelf) for the ordinary Transformation of à ſort of Animals'not much unlike Graſs. hoppers) into Vegetables, at a certam ſeaſon of the year. But ſince Iſate down this Relation of St Fohn Lanceſter, I have met with unother, whoſe ſtrangeneſs may much countenance it, in a ſmall Tract newly publiſYd by a Jeſuite, F. Michael Boym, whom a good Criticlk much commended to me. For this Author doth, as æn Eyvewitneſſe, affirme that, which is little leſſe to my preſent Purpoſe, * Ie vis, having had occaſion to do it elſewhere. It is extant Lib. 5. Cap.21. and at the cloſe of his Narrative he ſubJoynes, Non eſt, quod quiſquam de veritate dubitet, cim infinitos teſes babeat Braſilia, & c.

J ſavin a ſmall freſiwater, and ſhallow Lake of the Iſland Hainan, (which belongs to China) Crabs, or Cranſiſhes, which, as ſoon as they were drawn ont of the ater, did in a moment looſe both Life and Motion, and became petrifyd, though nothing appearã to be changd either in the External or Internal ſigure of their Bodies. What he further addes of theſe Fiſhes, is but oſ their Virtues in Phyſick, which, not concerning our ſubject, I ſhall (Pyrophilus) willingly prætermit it; and even, as to our Country- man's relation, hoping, by means of an Ingenious Correſpondent in the Eaſt: Indies, toreceive a further Information about the. ſtrange Plant he mentions, I ſnall, at preſent, urge onely what has been taken notice of concerning Coral, to countenance the Obſervation, for whoſe ſake theſe Narratives have been alleadg'dc And ſo likewiſe, as to what I was ſaying ot Glaſs, and Gunpowder, our receiving of thoſe and the generality of Factitious Bodies into the Catalogue of Natural Bodiẽs, is not (which I formerly alſo intimated) neceſſary to my preſent Argument: wheretoit is ſuſficignt, that Vitriol is granted on all hands to be a Natural Body, though it be alſo producible by Art. And alſo to the Argument it aftords us, we might adde that memorable Experiment deliver'd by Helmont, of turning Oyl of Vitriol into Allom, by the Odour (as he calls it) of Mercury, if, however it be not deſpicable, we had found it fit to be relyd on. But reſerving an Account of that for another place, we ſhall ſubſtitute the Inſtance, preſented us by our Author, about the Production of Saltpetre: for if, having diſſolvd Pot. aſhes in fair water, you coagulate the filtrated Solution into a white Salt, and on that pour Spirit of Nitre, till they will not hiſõ any longer together, there ill ſhoot, when the ſuperfluous water is Evaporated, Chriſtals, that proclaim their Nitrous Nature by their Priſmotical, Cor at leaſt Priſme: like) Shape, their eaſſe Fuſion, their Accenſion, and Deſlagration, and other Qualities, parily mentiond by our Author, and partly diſcoverable by a little Cuſioſity in making Tryals. I I. Experimental Attempts about the Redintegration of T He former of thoſe two Arguments, ( Pyrophilu) by which I propoſd to confirme the Origine of Forms, was, as you may remember, grounded upon the Manner, by which ſuch a Convention of Accidents, as deſerves to paſſe for a Form, may be producd: proſecuted, it now remains, that we proceed to the Second Argument, drawn, not ſas the former) from the firſt Production, but from the Reproduction of a Phyſical Body. And though both theſe Arguments are vaiid; yet if this Latter could, in ſpight of the Diſſiculties intervening in making of the Experiments that belong toũt, be as clearly made out as the former, you would, I ſuppoſe, like it much the better of the two. For if we could Rẽproduce a Body, which has been deprivd of its ſubſtantial Form, you would, I preſume, think it highly probable, if not more then probable, that ſto borrow our Authors Expreſſion) That which is commonly call'/d the Form of a Concrete, which gives it its Being and Denomination, and from whence all iĩts Qulities are in the Vulgar Philoſophy, by Inow not what inexplicable waies, ſuppoſd to low; may be in ſome Bodies cation of the Matter they conſiſt of; whoſe parts, by being ſo and ſò diſpoſd in relation to each other, conſtitute ſuch a determinate kind of Body, endowd with ſuch and ſuch Properties, whereas, if the ſame parts were otherwiſe diſpoſd, they vonld conſtitute other Bodies, of very differing Natures from that of the Concrete, whoſe parts they formerly were, and which may again reſult or be producd, aſter its diſſipation, and ſeeming deſtruction, by the Reunion of the ſame component Particles, aſſociated according to their former Diſpoſition. li But though it were not Impoſſible to make an adæquate Redintegration of a Chymically Anali?d Body, becauſe ſome of the diſſipatèd parts will either eſcape through the Junctures o? the Veſſels, (though diligently cloſd,) or, if they be very ſubtle, will fly aay upon the diſjoyning of the Veſſels; or, will irrecoverably ſtick to the inſiqe of them: yet Iſee not, why ſuch a Reproduction, as is very poſſible to be effe-cted, may not ſuffice to manifeſt what we intend to make out by it. For, even in ſuch Experiments, it appears, that when the Form of a Natural Body is aboliſd, and its parts violently ſcatter'd; by the bare Reunion of ſome parts aſter the former manner, the very ſame Matter, the deſtroy'd Body was before made of, may, without Addition of other Bodies, be brought again to conſtitute a Body of the like Nature with the former, though not of equæl Bulk. And indeed, the Experiment, recorded by our Author, about the Reproduction of Salt Petre, as it is the beſt and ſucceſſesſulleſt I have ever been able to make upon Bodies, that reqnire a ſtrong Heat to diſſipate them; ſo I hope it will ſuffice to give you thoſe thonghts about this mat. ter, that the Author deſigned in alledging it; and therefore, though having premiſid thus much, I ſhalſproceed to acquaint you with the ſucceſs of ſome Attempts he intimates (in that Eſſay) his Intention of making, for the Redintegration of ſome Bodies; yet doing it onely out of ſome Hiſtorical Notes I ſind among my looſe Papers, That, which Iat preſent pretend to, is, but partly to ſew you the difjiculty of ſuch Attempts, which, ſince our Authors Eſſay was communicated, have been repreſented (I fear by Conjecture onely) as very eaſie to be accurately enough done; and partly, becauſe our Author does not, without reaſon, intimate the uſefulneſs of Redintegrations, in caſe they can be effected; and does, not cau ſeleſly, intimate, that ſuch Attempts, though the; ſhonld not Perfectly ſucceed, may increaſe the Number of Noble and Active Bodies, and conſequently, the Inventory of Mankind's Goods. Upon ſuch Conſiderations we attempted the Diſſipation and Reunion of the parts of common Amber; and though Chymiſts, for fear of breaking their Veſſels, are wont, when they commit it to diſtillation, to adde to it a caput mortuum (as they ſpeal) of Sand, Driclr, &c. (in whoſe room we ſometimes chooſe to ſubſtitute beaten Glaſs; Jwhich hinders them to judęe of and employ the Remanence oſ the Amber, after the Diſtillation is finiſh'd: yvet we ſuppoſd, and found, that i the Retort were not too much ſill'd, and if the Fire were ſlowly and warily enough adminiſter'd, the Addition oſ any other Body would be neecleſss. Wheretore hoving put into a Glaſs Retort four or five Ounces of Amber, and adminiſtred a gentle and gradual heat, we obſerv'd the Amber to melt and bubble, (which we thereſore mention, becauſe ingenious men have lately queſtioned, whether it can be melteq,) and having ended the Operation, & ſeverd the veſſels, we found, that there was come over in theform, partly of Oyl, partly of Spirit & Flegm, and partly of volatile Salt, near half the weight of thè Concrete: and having broken the Retort, we found, in the bottom of it, a Cake of coal- black Matter, then whoſe upper ſurface Iſcarce remember to have ſeen in my whole life any thing more exquiſitely poliſd; in ſo much, that, notwithſtanding the Colour, as long as I kept it, it was ſit to ſerve for a Looking Glaſs: and this ſmooth Maſs being broken, (for it was exceeding brittle,) the larger fragments of it appear'd adorn'd with an excellent Iuſtre. All thoſe parts of the Amber, being put together into a Glaſs Body, with a blind head luted to it, were placed in Sand, to be incorporated by a gentle heat: but whilſt I ſtept aſide to receive a Viſit, the Fire having been incread without my nowledge, the Fumes aſcended ſo copiouſly, that they lifted up the Veſſel out of the Sand, whereupon falling againſt the ſide of the Furnace, it broke at the top, but, being ſeaſonably call'd, we ſavd all but the Fumes; and the remaining Matter looks not unlike Tarre, and with the leaſt heat may be powrd out like a Liquor, ſticking even when it is cold to the fingeęrs. Yet this opend Body doth not eãſily communicate ſo much as a Tincture to ſpirit of Wine, (which therefore ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, becauſe another time preſumeing, that this would be a good way to obtain a Solution of ſome of the reſinous parts of Amber, we did, by pouring ſpirit of Wine, that (though rectify'd) was not of the very beſt, upon the reunited parts of Amber, lightly digeſted into a Maſs, eaſily obtain a clear Yellow Solution, very differing from the Tincture of Amber, and abounding tas I found by Tryal) in the diſſolvqd ſubſtance of the Amber:) but in Oyl of Turpentine we have, in a ſhort time, diſſolv/dit into a bloud red Balſome, which may be of good uſe ?at leaſt) to Chirurgions. And having agen mãde the former Experiment with more arineſs then beſore, we had the like ſucceſs in our Diſtillation, bur, the reunited parts of the Amber being ſet to digeſt in ⸗a large Boit head, the Liquor that was drawn off, did, in a few hours, from its own Caput mortuum extract a bloud red Tincture, or elſe made a Solution of ſome part of it, whereby it obtaind a very deep Red; but having been, by intervening Accidents, hindred from finiſhing the Experiment, we miſt the Satisfaction of knowing to what it may be brought at laſt. And as for what our Author tels us of this deſign to attempt the Redintegration of Vitriol, Turpentine, and ſome other Concretes, wherein it ſeemd not unpracticable, he found in it more difſiculty then every one would expect. For the Bodies, on which ſuch Experiments are likelieſt to ſucceed, ſeem to be Allom, Sea ſalt, and Vitriol: And as for Allom, he found it a troubleſome work to take (as a Spagiriſt would ſpeak) the Principles of it aſunder, in regard, that ĩt is inconvenient to diſtill it witha Caput mortuum, (as Chymiſts call any fix'd Additament,) leaſt that ſhould hinder the deſir'd Redintegration of the diſſipated parts: And when he diſtilid it by its ſelf, without any ſuch Additament, he found, that, with a moderate heat, the Allom would ſcarce part with any thing but its Phlegm, and if he urg'd it with a ſtrong fire, he found, it would ſo ſwell, as to endanger the breaing of the Retort, or threaten the boyling over into the Receiver. ( Yet having once been able very warily to abſtract as much Flegm and Spirit, as I conveniently could, from a parcel of Roch Allom, and having powrd it back upon that pulveriæ'd caput mortuum, and left the veſſel long in a quiet place, I found, that the Corpuſcles of the Liquor, having had time, after a multitude ſinite themſelves to the more fix'd parts ofthe Concrete, did by that Aſſociation (or Diſſolution) recompoſe, at the top of the Powder, many Chriſtalline Grains of finely figur'ã Salt, which increaſing with time, made me hope, that, at the length, the whole or the greateſt part would be reducd into Allom, which yet a Miſchance, that robbd me of the Glaſs, hindred me to ſee.) So likewiſe of Sea ſalt, it it be diſtil'd, as it is uſual, with thrice its weight of burn'd Clay, or beaten Brick, twill prove inconvenient in reſerence to its Redintegration; and jſ it be diſtill'd alone, it is apt to be fluxt by the heat of the fire, anq, whilſt it remains in Euſion, will ſcarce yield any Spirit at all. And as for Vitriol, though the Redintegration of it might ſeem to be leſs hopeſul, then that of the other Salts, in regard that it conſiſts not onely of à Saline, but of a Metalline Body, whence it may be ſuppoſd to be of a more intricate and elaborate Texture: vet becauſe there needs no caput mortunm in the Diſtillation of it, we did, to purſue our Authors intimated deſigns, make two or three Attempts upon it, and ſeemd to miſs of our Aime, rather upon the Account of accidental hinderances, then of any inſuperable difficulty io the thing it ſelf. For once, we with a ſtrong fire, drew off from a parcel of common blew Vitriol, the Phlegm and Spirit, and ſome quantity of the heavy Oyl, ſas Chymiſts abuſively call it:) Theſe Liquors, as they came over without Separation, we divided into ſeveral parts, and the remaining very red Caput mortuum into as many. One of theſe parcels of Liquor we poured over night upon its correſpondent portion of the newly mentioned red Powder. But hoving leſt it in a Window, and the Night proving very bitter, in the morning I found the Glaſs crack'd in many places by the violence of the Froſt, and the Liquor ſeemd to have been ſoak'd up by the Powder, and to have very much ſelled it. This mixture then I took out, and placing it in an open moutvd Glaſs in a Window, I tound, after a while, divers Grains of pure Vitriol upon the other Matter, and ſome little Swellings, not unlike thoſe we ſhail preſently have Occaſion to ſpeak of. I took likewiſe a much larger parcel of the forementioned Liquor, ànd its correſpondent proportion of Caput mortuum; and having leiſurely mixt them in a large Glaſs Baſon, Iobtaind divers Phænomena, that belong not to this place, but may be met with, where they will more properly fall in. In this Baſon (which Ilayd in the Window, and kept from Agitation,) I perceived, after a while, the Liquor to acquire a blewiſh Tincture, and aſter ten or twelve weeks, I found the mixture dry, (for, it ſeems, it was too much expoſed to the An:) but the Surface of it adornd in divers riouſly figurd. And beſides theſe, there were ſtore of Protuberances, which conſiſted of aboundance of ſmall vitriolate particles, which ſeemd in the way to a Coalition; for having let the Baſon a]one for four or five months longer, the Matter appear'd cruſted over, partly with very elevated Saline protuberances, partly with leſſer parcels, and partly alſo with conſiderably broad Cakes of Vitriol, ſome of above half an Inch in breadth, and proportionably long: and indeed the whole ſurface was ſo odly diverſiſd, that I cannot count the trouble, theſe Tryals have put me to, miſpent. Another time in a more ſlender and narrov moutd Glaſs ĩ pourd back upon the Caput mortuum of Vitriol the Liquors, I had by violence of the fire forcd from it; ſo that the Liquid part did ſim a pretty height above the red Calx, and remain'd a while limpid and colourleſs: but the veſſel having ſtood, ſor ſome time, unſtopd in a Window, the Liquor aſter a while, acquird by degrees a very deep vitriolate colour, and not long after, there appeard, at the bottom and on the top of the Calæ, mony fair and exquiſitely figurd Grains of Vitriol, which coverd the ſurface of the Calxæ; and the longer the veſlel continu'd in the Window, the deeper did this Change, made upon the upper part of the Powder, ſeem to penetrate: ſo that I began to hope, that, in proceſs of time, almoſt ſif not more then almoſt) the whole mixture would be reducd to perfect Vitriol. But an Accident robb/d me of my Glaſs, before I could ſee the utmoſt of the Event. ll And, on this Occaſion, I muſt not prætermit an odd Experiment I lately made, though I dare not undertake to make it agen. I elſewhere relate; howI digeſted, for divers weeks, a Quantity of poꝶter ꝗ Antimony, with a greater weight by half of Oyl of Vitriol, and how having at length committed this mixture to Diſtillation, and thereby obtained, beſides a little Liquor, a pretty quantity of combuſtible Antimonial or Antimonio- Virriolate Sulphur; there remained, in the bottom of the Retort, a ſomewhat light and very friable Caput mortuum, all the upper part oſ which was at leaſt as white as common Woodaſhes, and the reſt lookd like a Cinder. And now I muſt tell you what became of this Caput mortuum, whereoſ Ithere make no further mention. We counld not well foreſee what could be made of it, but very prohable it was, that it would afford us ſome new Diſcovery, by being expoſed to the fire, in regard of the copious Sulphur, whereof it ſeemd to have been deprived: provided it were urg]d in cloſe Veſſels, where nothing could be loſt. Whereupon committing it to a naked fire in a ſmall glaſs Retort, well Coated, and accommodated with a Receiver, we kept it there many hours, and at length ſevering the Veſſels, we found (which need not be wonderd at) no Antimonial Quick-ſilver, and much leſs of Sulphur ſublim'd then we expected: wherefore greedily haſtning to the Caput mortuum, We found it luxd into a Maſs, covered with a thin Cake of Glaſs, whole fragments being held againſt the light, were not at all coloured, as antimonial Glaſs is wont to be, but were as colourleſſe as common white Glaſs. The Lump above mentioned being broken, was found, ſomewhat to our wonder, to be perfect black Antimony, adorn'd with long ſhining ſtreaks, as common Antimony is wont to be: onely this Antimony ſeem d to have been a little reſin'd by the ſequeſtration of its unneceſſary Sulphur; which Ingredient ſeems by this Experiment, as well as by ſome other Obſervations ofours, to be more copious in ſome particular Parcels of that Mineral, then is abſolutely requiſite to the conſtitution of Antimony. Though in our caſe it may be luſpected, that the reduction of part of the Maſs to a colourleſs Glaſs, was an effect of the Abſence of ſo much of the Sulphur, and might in part make the remaining Maſſe ſome amends for it. What we further did with this new or reproduced Concrete, is not proper to be here told you: onely, for your ſatistaction, we have kept a Lump ofit, that you may, with us, take notice of what ſome Philoſophers would call the Mindfulueſs of Nature, which, when a Body was deprived ofa not inconſiderable portion of its chiefe Ingredient, and had all its other parts diſſipated, and ſhuſfled, and diſcolourd, ſo as not to be knowable, was able to rally thoſe ſcatter'd and diſguiſed parts, and Marſhal or diſpoſe them into a Body of the former Conſiſtence, Colour, &ec. though (which is not here to be overlook'd) the Contexture of Antimony, by realon of the copious ſhining Styriæ, that enoble the darker Body, be much more elaborate, and therefore more uneaſie to be reſtored, then that of many other Concretes. But among all my Tryals about the Redintegration of Bodies, That which ſeemd to ſucceed beſt, was made upon Turpentine: for having taken ſome Ounces of this, very pure, and good, and put it into à Glaſs Retort, I diſtill'd ſo long with a very gentle fire, till Ihad ſeparated it into agood quantity of very clear Liquor, and a Cæput mortuum very dry and brittle: then breaking the Retort, I powderd the Caput mortuum, which, when it was taken out, was exceeding ſleek, and tranſparent enough, and very Red; but being powderd, appear'd of a pure Yellow colour. This Powder I carefully mixt vvith the Liquor, that had been diſtill'd from it, vvhich immediately diſſolv]d part of it into a deep red Balſam; but by further Digeſtion in a large Glaſs exquiſitely ſtopt, that Colour began to grovv ſainlll ter, though the remaining part of the Povvder, (except a very little proportionable to ſo much of the Liquor, as may be ſuppoſd to have been vvaſted by Evaporation, and Transfuſion out of one Veſſel into another,) be perfectly diſſolvd, and ſo well reunited to the more fugitive parts of the Concrete, that there is ſcarce any, that by the ſmell, or taſt, or conſiſtence, vvould take it for other then good and laudable Turpentine.

For to aſcribe all paiticular Phænomena, thai ſcem any thing Difjicult, (for abundance are not thought ſo, ihat are ſo,) to ſubſtantial Forms, and, but nominally underſtood, Qualities, is ſo general and eaſie a way of reſolving Difficultics, that it allows Naturaliſis, without Diſpatagement, to be very Careleſs and Lavy, ifit do not mike th.m ſo: as in eſſect ue may ſ. e, that in about 2000 years ſince Ariſtotſes time, ibe Adorers of his Phy-. ſicls, at leaſt by vertue of Flis peculiar Principles, ſeem to have done little more more ihen rangle, witlout clcaring up (that I buow oſ) any myſtery of Natre, or producing any uſeſul or noble Experinients: whereas ihe Cultivators oſ ihe Particularian Ph loſorhy, being obliged by the natire of thet?

SE cTIOM containing the EXPERIMENTS. Experiment . ALe good and clear Oyl of Vitriol, 2and caſt into it a convenient quan⸗ tity of good Camphire groſly beaten; let it float there a while, and, without the help of external heat, it will inſenſlibly be reſolvd into a Liquor, which, from time to time, as it comes to be producd, you mav, by ſhaking the Glaſs, mingle with the Oyl of Vitriol, whereunto you may, by this means, impart fitſt a fine Yellow, and then a colour, which though it be not a true Red, will be of kintoit, and ſo very deep, as to make the mixture almoſt quite Opacous. When all the Camphire is perfectly diſſolv'd by incorporating with the Menſtruum, if you hit upon good Ingredients, and upon a right Proportion, (for a ſlight Miſtake in either of them, may make this part of the Experiment miſcarry,) you may probably obtain ſuch a mixture,. as I have more then once had, namely, ſucha one, as not onely to me, whoſe ſenſe of Smelling is none of the Dulleſt, but alſo to others, that knew not of the Experiment, ſeemd not at all to have an Odour of the Camphire. But if into this Liquor yon poura due quantity of fair Water, you vill ſee (perhaps not without delight) that, in a trice, the Liquor will become pale, almoſt as at the ſirſt, and the Camphire, that lay conceal’d in the pores of the Menſtruum, will immediately diſcloſe it ſelf, and emerge, in its own nature and priſtine form of white floating and combuſtible Camphire, which will fill not the Viol onely, but the neighbouring Odour. Now the Phanomena of this Experiment may, beſides the uſes we elſewhere male ofit, aftord us ſeveral particulars pertinent to our preſent purpoſe. I. For (ſirſt) we ſee a lighter and conſiſtent Body brought, by a Comminution, into Particles of a certain figure, tò be kept ſimming, and mixed with a Liquor, on which it floated before, and which is, by great odds, heavier then it ſelf: ſo that as by the Solution oſ Gold in Aqua regis, it appears, that the ponperouſeſt of Bodies, if it be reducd to parts minute enough, may be kept from ſinking in a Liquor much lighter thenit felf: So this Experiment of Ours mani. feſts what I know not whether hitherto Men have provd, That the Corpuſcles of Lighter Bodies may bè kept from emerging to the Top of a much heavier Liquor: which Inſtance being added to that of the Gold, may teach us, that, when Bodies are reduc'd to very minute parts, e muſt as well conſider their particular Texture, as the receiv'd Rules of the Hydroſtaticks, in determining whether they will ſink, or ſloat. or ſwim. II. This Experiment alſo ſhews, that ſeveral Colours, and even ãa very deep one, may ſoon be producd by ã White Body, and a clear Liquor, and that without the intervention oſ fire, or any external heat. II. And that yet this Colour may, almoſt in the twinckling of an Eye, be deſtroyd, and as it were annihilated, and the Latitant Whiteneſs, as many would call it, may be a5 ſuddainly reſtord by the Addition of nothing but fair Water, vhich has no Colour of its ovvn, upon vvhoſe account it might be ſurmiſd to be contrary to the periſhing colour, or to heighten the other into a Prædominancy: nor does the Water take into its ſelf, either the Colour ĩt DIV. The more then ſemi- opacity of the Solution of Camphire and Oyl of Vitriòl does preſently vaniſh; and that Menſtruum, with the Water, male up (as ſoon as the Camphorate Corpuſcles come to be a ſloat) one tranſparent and colourleſs Liquor. V. And tis worth noting, that upon the mixture of a Liquor, which makes the Fluid much Lighter, (for ſo Water is in reſpect of Vitriol,) a Body is made to emerge, that did not ſo, when the Fluid was much heavier. This Experiment may ferve to countenance what we elſewhere argue againſt the Schouls, touching the Controverſie about Miſtion. For whereas though ſome of them diſſent, yet moſt o them maintain, that the Elements alwaies looſe their Forms in the mixd Bodies they conſtitute; and though if they had dexterouſly propoſd their Opinion, and limited their Aſſertions to ſome caſes, perhaps the DPoctrine might be tolerated: yet ſince they are wont to propoſe it crudely and univerſally, I cannot but take notice, how little tis favour'd by this Experiment; wherein even a mix'd Body (for ſuch is Camphire) doth, in a further miſtion, retain its Form and Nature, and may be immediately ſo divorced from the Body, to whichit was united, as to turn, in à trice, to the manifeſt Exerciſe ofſ its former Qualities. And this Experiment being the eaſieſt Inſtance, I have deviſd, of the preſervation of ⸗a Body, when it ſeems to be deſtroy'd, and of the Recovery of a Body to its former Conditions; I deſire it may be taken notice of, as an inſtance I ſhall aſter have Occaſion to have recourſe to, and make uſe of. E Vi. But the notableſt thing in the Experiment is, that Odours ſhould depend ſo much upon Texture, that one of the ſubtleſt and ſtrongeſt ſented Drugs, that the Eaſt it ſelf or indeed the World affords us, ſhould ſo ſoon quite looſe its Odour, by being miæã with a Body that has ſcarce, if at all, any ſenſible Odour of its own, and This, while the Camphorate Corpuſcles ſurvive undeſtroyd, in a Liquor, from whence one would think, that leſſe ſubtle and fugitive Bodies, then they, ſhould eaſily exhale, ll l VII. Noris it much leſſe conſiderable, that ſo ſtrongand piercing a Sent as that of Camphire, ſhould be, ina moment, producd in a Mixture, wherein none of it could be perceivd before, by ſuch a Liquor as Water, that is quite devoid of any Odour of its own: which ſo eaſie and ſuddain reſtauration of the Camphire to its Native Sent, as well as other Qualities, by ſo langnuid a Liquor as common Water, doth likewiſe argue, that the Union or Texture of the two Ingredients, the Camphite and the Oyl of Vitriol, was but very ſlight, upon which nevertheleſſe a great alteration in point ofQualities depended. Andto conlltl Firme, that divers of the præceding Phæ: nomena depend uponthe particular Texture of the Liquors, imploy'd to exhibit them, I ſhall add, that it inſtead of oyl of Vitriol, you caſt the Concrete into well deſlegm?d Spirit of Nitre, you will obtain no red, nor dark, but a Tranſparent and Colourleſs Solution. And When to the above mentiond red Mixture I put, inſtead of fair Water, about 2 or 3 parts of duely rectifid Spirit of Wine, there would enſue no ſuch chænges, as thoſe formerly. recited; but the Spirit of Wine, that diſſolv'd the Conciete, when it was by it ſelf, without looſing its Diaphaneity, or acquiring any Colour, did, when it diſſolvd the Mixture, diſſolve it with its new adventitious Colour, looking like a groſ' red Wine. ſomewhat turbid, or not yet well freed from its Lees: ſo that this Colour appeard to reſide in the Mixture as ſuch, ſince neither of the two Ingredients diſſolv'd in, or mingled vvith the Spirit of Wine, would have aſſorded that Colour, or indeed any other. But if to this Liquor, that lookd like troubled Wine, we poured a large Proportion of fair Water, the Redneſs would immediately vaniſn, and the Whole would, as to ſenſe, become White throughout; I ſay,  io ſenſe, becauſe the Whiteneſſe did not indeed appertain properly to the whole Mixture, but to a huge multitude of little Corpuſcles of the revivd Concrete, whereof ſome or other, which at firſt ſvamme confuſedly to and fro, left no ſenſible Portion of the Liquor unfurniſh'd with ſome of them; whereas when the Camphorate Corpuſcles had leiſure to emerge, as they ſoon did, they floated in the forme ofa White Powder or Froth at the top of the Liquor, leaving all the reſt as clear and colourleſſe as the common Water. lll But we have not yet mentiond all the uſe, we deſign'd to make of our Mixture, for by proſecuting the Experiment a little farther, we made it aftord us ſome new Phænomena. VIII. For having kept the Mixture in a moderately warme place, (which circumſtance had perhaps no influence on the Succeſſe,) and having diſtill'd it out of a Glaſs Retort, the Event anIwer d our Expectation, and the Liquor, that came over, had a Sent; which, though very ſtrong, was quite differing both from that of the Mixture, and that of the Camphire; and in the remaining Body, though the Liquor and the Camphire it conſiſted of, were either both tranſparent, or the one tranſparent as ã Liquor, and the other white, as tranſparent and colourleſſe Bodies are wont to be made by Contuſion: yet the remaining Maſs, which amounted to à good part of the Mixture, was not oneIy Opacous, but as black as Coal, in ſome places looking juſt like poliſ Jet; which Is the more couſiderable, becauſe that though Vegetable Subſtances, that are not fluid, are wont to acquire a Blackneſs from.the fire, yet neither do Liquors, that have already been diſtill'd, obtain that Colour upon Rediſtillation; neither have we, upon Tryal purpoſely made, found, that Camphire, expoſd to ſire in a Retort, fitted with a Receiver, (which was the caſe of the preſent Experiment,) would at all acquire a Jetty Colour, but would either totally aſcend White, or afford Flores, and a Gaput mortuum (as a vulgar Chymiſt would call the Remaines) of the ſame Colour, both in reſpect of one another, and in reſpect of the Camphire. IX. And our Experiment afforded this notable Phænomenon, That though Oyl of Vitriol be a diſtill'd Liquor, and though Camphire be ſo very fugitive a Subſtance, that being le ft in the Air, it will, of it ſelf, fly all away; and therefore Phyſicians and Druggiſts preſcribe the keeping it in Linſeeds or Millium, or other convenient Bodies, to hinder its Avolation; yet, by our Experiment, its Fugacity is ſo reſtrain'd, that not onely the Gaput mortuum newly mention'd, endured a good fire in the Retort, before it was reducd to that pitchy Subſtance vve vvere lately mentioning, but having taken ſome of that ſubſtance out of the Retort, & orderd it, by a carefuiWorkman, to be kept in a cloſely coverd Crucible during ſome time in the fire; when it vvas brought me back, after the Pot had been kept red hot above half an hoũr, there remain'd a good quantity of the Matter, brittle, vvithout any ſmell of Camphire, and as black as ordinary Charcoals ſo much do the Eixity and Volatility of Bodies depend upon Texture, l E xperiment II. AMong thoſe other Experiments of mine, (Pyrophilus) which tend to manifeſt, that new Qualities may be producd in Bodies, as the Effects of new Textures; I remember, ſome years ago, Irit for a Friend a whole Set of Tryals, that Ihad made about the Changes I could produce in Metals and Minerals, by the Intervention of Sublimate. But though the whole Tract, wherein they are recited, might be pertinent enough to our preſent Subject; yet reſerving other paſſages of it for other places, (eſpecially for our Notes upon thoſe particular Qualities, which they are moſt proper to illuſtrate,) it may at this time ſuffice me to ſend you a Tranſcript of what that Account contains, relating to Copper and Silver, the one a mean and fugitive, and the other a noble and ſix'd Metal. For thoſe changes Coloſũr, Conſiſtence, Fuſibleneſſe, and other Qualities, which you wiil meet with in theſe Experiments, will afford us divers Phænomena, to ſhew what great Changes may be made, even in Bodies ſcarce corruptible, by one or more of thoſe three Catholick wayes of Natures working according to the Corpuſcular Principles, namely, the Acceſs, the Receſs, and the Tranſpoſition of the minute Particles of Matter. As for my Method of changing the Texture of Copper, I confeſs it hath oftentimes ſeemd ſtrange to me, that Chymiſts, plainly ſeeing the notable Effect, that Sublimate, diſtill'd from Antimony, has upon that Mineral, by opening it, and volatilizing it, s we ſee it do in the making of what they are pleaſd to call Mercurius vita,) ſnould not have the Curioſity to try, whether or no Sublimate might not likewiſe rable Change in other Mineral Bodies, there appearing no reaſon, or at leaſt there having been none given, that I Iknow of, why the Reſerating Operation (if I may ſo ſpeak) oſ Sublimate, ſhould be confin'd to Antimony. Upon theſe Conſiderations, we were invited to endeavour to ſupply the Neglect we had obſerv'd in Chymiſts, of improving the Experiment of Butyrum Antimonti: and though an Indiſpoſition in point of Health, which befell us before we had made any great progreſs in our Enquiries, made us ſo ſhy oſ the Fumes of Sublimate and Minerals, that we neither did make all our Tryals ſo accurately, nor proſecute them ſo far as we would have done, had we been to deal with more innocent Materials: Yet we ſuppoſe, it ill not be unwelcome to You, to receive from us a naked, but faithful, Narrative of our Proceedings; being apt to think, that you will therein find Inducements to carry on this Experiment further then we have done, and to compleat whãt we have but beun, BEũ ten, we took half a pound of Copper plates, of about an Inch broad, and the thickneſs of a Grain of Wheat, (which we after found was too great,) and of an arbitrary length; then caſting a Pound of groſly beaten Venetian SubJimate into the bottom of a ſomewhat deep Glaſs Retort, we caſt in the Copper plates upon it, that the Fumes of ihe Sublimate might, in their Aſcenſion, be compell'd to act upon the incumbent Metal, and then placing this Retort, as deep as we well could, in a Sand Furnace, and adapting to it a ſmall Receiver, we adminiſter'd a Gradual fire ſeavenor eight hours, and at length for a while increaſd the heat, as much as we well could do in ſuch a Furnace. The ſucceſs of this Operation was as follows. 1. There came little or no Liquor at all over into the Receiver, but the Neck & upper part of the Retort were Candied on the inſide, by reaſon of the copious Sublimate adhæring to them; which Sublimate weigh'd above Ten Ounces; in the Retort we found about two Oun. ces and a quarter of running Mercury, which had been ſuffer'd to revive by the acid Salts, which corroding the Copper, forſook the Quickſilver, whereto they had been in the Sublimate united. 2. Upon the increaſe of the fire, there was plainly heard a Noiſe, made by the melting Matter in the Retort, not unlike that of a boyling Pot, br of Vitriol, when being committed to a Calcining fire, it is firſt brought to flow. And this Noiſe e found to be a more conſtant Circumſtance of this Experiment, then the revification of part of the Mercury containd in the Sublimate; for upon another Tryal, made with the former proportion of Copper plates and Sublimate, we obſervd, during a very long while, ſuch a Noiſe as hath been already mention'd, but the Operation being finiſ?d, we ſcarce found ſo much as a few Grains of rnnning Mercury, either in the Retort or Receiver. 3. We found the Metalline Lump, in the bottom of the Retort, to have been increaſdin weight ſomewhat more then (though not half an Ounce above) two Ounces; ſome ofthe Copper plates, lying at the bortom of the Maſs, retaind yet theic Figure and Malleableneſſe, which we aſcrib'd to their not having been thin enough to be ſufficiently wrought upon by the Sublimate: the Others, which were much the greater number, had wholly loſt their Metalline form, and were melted into a very brittle Lump, which Ican compare to nothing more fitly, then a lump of good Benjamin, for this Maſs, though ponderous, was no leſs brittle, and being broken, appeard of divers Colours, which ſeemd to be almoſt tranſparent, in ſome places it was red, in others of a high and pleaſant Amber Coloũr, and in other parts of it, Colours more daraſi and mix/d might be diſcern-d. . But this ſtrange Mals being bro_ into ſmaller Lumps, and laid upon a Sheet of White Paper in a Window, was, by the next morning, where ever the Alr came at it, all coverd with a lovely greeniſh Blew, or rather, blewiſh Green, almoſt like that of the beſt Verdegreeſe, and the longer it lay in the air, the more of the internal parts oſ the Fragments did paſs into the ſame Colour; but the vvhite Paper, which in ſome places they ſtaind, ſeem Dyd of a Green colour inclining unto Yellow, And here we had Occaſion to take notice of the inſinuating ſubtlety of the Air, for having put ſome pieces of this Cupreous Gum ſf Imay ſocall it) into a little Pox, to ſhut out the Air, which vve have found it poſſible to exclude by other means, vve found, that notnithſtanding our care, thoſe included Fragments were, as ell as the reſt alã ready mentiond, covered with the powder, as it were of viride æris. 5. We muſt not, on this Occaſion, omit to tell you, that, having, the laſt year; made ſome Tryals in reference to this Experiment, we obſerv'd in one of them, that ſome little Copper plates, from which Sublimate had been drawn off, retain'd their priſtine ſhape, and Metalline nature, but were Whitened over like Silver, and continud ſo for divers Months, ſthough we cannot preciſely tell you hovv long, having at lengthaccidentally loſt them.) And to try vhether this Whiteneſs vvere onely ſuperficial, ve purpoſely broke ſome of theſe flexible Plates, and found, that this Silver colour had penetrated them throughout, and vvas more glorious in the very Body of the Metal, then on its Surfacè, vvhich made us ſuſpect, that the Sublimate, by us imploy d, had been with the Sophiſticators of Metals arè wont to make Blanchers for Copper, but not to mention, that rhe Malleableneſſe continud, which Arſenick is wont to deſtroy, )we diſcover'd not by Tryal, that the Sublimãte was other then ſincere. 6, In this Metalline Gum the Body of the Copper appear'd ſo chang'd and open'd, that we were invited to look upon ſuch a Change as no ignoble Experiment, conſidering the Diſficulty, which the beſt Artiſts tell us there ĩs, and which thoſe, that have attempted it, have found, I ſay not, to unlock the Sulphur of Venus, but to effect leſſe Changes in its Texture, then was hereby made. For this Gum, caſt upona quick Coal, and a little blown, will partly melt and ſlow like Roſin, and partly, flame, and burn like a Sulphur, and witha flame ſo laſting, if it be rekindled as often as it leaves oſfburning, that we obſervd it, not without ſome lilll x Wonder⸗ Wonde; and ſo inflammable is this opened Copper, that, being held to the ſ=ame oſ a Candle, or a piece of lighted Paper, it would almoſt in a moment take fire, and ſend forth a fſlame like common Sulphur, but onely that it ſeemd to us to incline much more to a greeniſh colour, then the blewer flam of Brimſtone is vont to doo.Totheſe Phanomena of our Experiment, as it was made with Copper, my Notes inable me to ſubjoyn ſome ohers, exhibited when we made it with Sublimate and Silver. There were taken of the pureſt ſort of Coined Silver we could get. half a ſcore thin Plates, on which vvas caſt double the vveight of Sublimate in a ſmall and ſtrongly coated Retort. This Matter being ſublimd in a naked fire, vve found, rhaving broken the Veſſel,) that the Sublimate vvas almoſt totally aſcended to the top ànd neck of the Retort, in the latter of vvhich appeardin IESE many \ many places ſome revivd Mercury, in the bottom of the Retort wè found a little fluxed Lump of Matter, which twas ſcarce poſſible to ſeparate from the Glaſs, but having, with much adoe divorcd them, we found this Maſs to be brittle, of a pale yellowiſh colour, of neer about the weight of the Metal, on which the Sublimate had been caſt. And in the thicker part of this Lump there appear'd, when it was broken, ſome part of the Silver plates, vvhich, though brittle, ſeemd not to have been perfectly diſſolvd. This Reſin of Silver did, like that of Copper, but more ſlowly, imbibe the Moiſture of the Air, and vvith.. in about 24 hours, vvas coverd vvith ã ſomevvhat greeniſn Duſt, concerning vvhich vve durſt not determine, vvhether it proceeded from that mixture of Copper, vvhich is generally to be met vvith in coyned Silver, or from Ihe compounded Meta. For the more curious ſort of Painters do, as theyv inxXa form us, by corroding coined Silver vvith the fretting ſteams of ſaline Bodies, or vvith corroſive Bodies themſelves, turn it iuto a fine kind of Azure, as we may elſevvhere have opportunity more particularly to declare I ſhall novv onely adde, that ſome ſmall fragments of our Reſin, being caſt upon red hot Coals, did there vvaſt themſelves in a ſlame not very diftering in colour from that of the former mention'd Reſin of Copper, but much more durable then vvould have eaſily been expected from ſo ſmall a quantitv of MatterThis is all the Account Ican give you ofour firſt Tryal, but ſuſpecting, that the Copper, vvont to be mixt as an Alloy vvith our coyned Silver, might have too much Inſluence on the recited Event, coming aſtervvards into a place, vvhere vve could procure Refid Silver, vve took an Ounce of That, and having Laminated it, vve caſt it upon tvvice its Weight of beaten Sublimate, which being driven away from it with a ſomewhat ſtrong fire, we took, out of the bottom of the Glaſs Retort, a Lump of Matter, which in ſome places, where it lay next the Glaſſe, was as it were ſilver'd over very finely, but ſo very thinly, that the Thickneſſe of the Silver ſcarce equall'd that of fine white Paper; the reſt of the Metal ſexcept a little that lay undiſſlolv'd almoſt in the middle of the Maſſe, becauſe, as we ſuppoſd, the Plates had not been bearen, till they were ſufficiently and equally thin, ) having been, by the ſaline part of the Sublimate, that ſtuck toit, colliquated into a Maſs, that Iook'd notat all like Silver, or ſo much as any other Metal or Mineral. llil Andtis remarkable, that though Silver be a fixt Metal, and accounted indeſtructible, yet it ſhouĩd by ſo ſlight an Operation, and by but about a quarter of its vveight of Additament, (as appeard by weighing the whole Lump,) be ſo ſtrangely diſguized, and have its Qualities ſo alter'dFor (firſt) though àan eminent White. neſſe be accounted the colour, which beJongs to pure Silver, and though beaten Sublimate be ãlſo eminently White; vet the Maſs, we are ſpeaking of, was partly of a Lemmon or Amber colour, or à deep Amethyſtinine colour, aud partly of ſodark a one, as it ſeem'd black: and it was pretty, that ſometimes in a fragment, that ſeemd to be one continued and entire piece, the upper part would be of a light Yellow, vvhich abruptly: ending, the lower vvas of a colour ſo obſcure, as ſcarce to challenge any name diſtinct from Black. Next whereas Silver is one of the moſt Opacous Bodies in Nature, and Sublimate a White one, the produc'd Maſs was in great part Tranſparent, though not like Glaſs, yet like good Amber. 3i Thirdly, the Texture of the Silver was exceedingly alterd: for our Maſs; inſtead of being Malleable and Flexible, as that Metal is very much, appearſ, if vou went about to cut it with a Knife, Jike Horn, yet otherwiſeeaſily apt to erack and break, though not at all to bend. llll Fourthly, whereas Silver willindure Ignition for a good while before it be brought to Fuſion, our Mixture will eaſily melt, not onely upon quick coals, but in the dame of a Candle; but this Reſin, or Gum (if Imay ſo callit) of our fixd Metal did not, like that, we formerly deſcrib'd, of Copper, tinge the ſlame of a Candle, or produce with the glowing coals, on which tis laid, either æ green or blewiſh colour. ll And Pyrophilus) to diſcover how much theſe Operations of the Sublimate upon Copper and Silver depend upon the particular Textures of theſe Bodies, Itook two parcels of Gold, the and the other very well refin'd, and having caſt each of theſe in a diſtinct Urinal, upon no leſs then thrice its weight ofgroſly beaten Sublimate, I cauſid this Jaſt namd ſubſtance tò be, in a Sand furnace, elevated from the Gold, but found not, that either of the two Parcels of that Metal was manifeſtly alter'd thereby: whether in caſe the Gold had been reduc'd to very minute particles, ſome kind of change (perhaps, if any differing enough from ihoſe Iately recited to have been made in the Copper and the Silver) might have been 'made in it, Iam not ſo abſolutely certain; but Iam confident, that by what I reſerve to tell you hereafter of Sublimates Operation upon ſome other Minerals, eſpecially Tin, it will appear, that That Operation depends very much upon the particular Texture of the Body, from whence that sublimate is Elevated. Before Idiſmiſs this ſubject, Pyrophilus, I muſt not conceale from you, that in the Papers, whence theſe Experiments made with Sublimate have been tranſcribed, Iannexd to the whole Diſcourſe a few Advertiſements, whereof the firſt was, That Iwas reducd, in thoſe Experiments, to imploy, for want ofa better, a Sand Furnace, wherein I could not give ſo ſtrong a fire as I deſird, which circumſtance may hãve had ſome Influence upon the recited Phæanomena; and among other Advertiſements there being one, that will not be impertinent to my preſent Deſigo, and may poſſibly afford a not unſuccesful Hint, I ſhall ſubjoin it in the words, wherein I find it deliverd. The next thing, of which Iam to advertiſe you, is this, That this Experiment may probably be further improvd, by imploying about it various and nev kinds of Sublimate, and that ſeveral other things may be ſublim'd up together either with crude Mercury, or ſiders the way of making vulgar Sublimate, will not, I ſuppoſe, deny. To give you onely one Inſtance, I ſhall inform you, that, having cauſ:d about equalparts of common Sublimate and Sal Armoniack to be well powderd andincorporated, by ſubliming the Mixture in ſtrong and large Urinals plac'd in a Sand Furnace, we obtaind a new kind of Sublimate, differing from the former, which we manifeſted ad oculum, by diſſolving a little ofit and a little of common Sublimate ſeverally in fair water; for dropping a litile reſolvd ſalt of Tartar upon the ſolution of common Sublimate, it immediately turn'd of an Orange tawny colour, but dropping the ſame Liquor upon the ſolution of the Ammoniack Sublimate, if I may ſo callit, it preſentIy turnd into a Liquor in Whiteneſſe reſembling Milk: And having from 4 ounces of Copper plates drawn 6 ounces of this new Sublimate after the already oſten recited manner, we had indeed in the bottom of the Retort a Cupreous Re ſin, not much unlike That, made by Copper and common Sublimate; and this Reſin did, like the other, in the moiſt Air, ſoon begin to degenerate into a kind of Verdigreeſe. But that which was ſingular in this Operation was, that not onely ſome of the Sublimate had carried up, to a good height, enough of the Copper to be manifeſtly colourq by it of a fine blewiſh Green, but into the Receiver there was paſs'd neer an Ounce of Liquor, that ſmelt almoſt like ſpirit of Sal Armoniack, and was tincted like the Sublimate, ſo that we ſuppoſd the Body. of the Venus to have been better wrought upon by this, then by the former Sublimate. And yet I judg]d not this way to be the moſt effectual way of improving common Sublimate, being apt to think, upon grounds not now to be mentiond, that it may, b convenient Liquors, be ſo far enrichd and advancd as to be made capable of opening the Compact Body of Gold it ſelt, and of producing in it ſuch Changes, (which yet perhaps will enrich but mens Underſtandings,) as Chyniiſts are wont very fruitleſly to attempt to make in that almoſt Indeſtructible Metal. But of This, having now given you a Hint, I dare here ſay no more. Experiment III. T Here is (Pyrophilus) another Experiment, which many wil find more eaſie to be put in practice, and which vet mãy, as to Silver, be made a kind of sucCedaneum to the former, and conſequently may ſerve to ſhew, how the like Qualities in Bodies may be effected by diſtering Wayes, provided a like Change of Texture be produc'd by them. Of This Iſhall give you an Example in that Preparation of Silver, that ſome Ghymiſts have call'd Luna coruca, which I ſnall not ſcruple to mention particularly, and apply to my preſent purpoſe; becauſe though the name o? Luna Cornea be already to be met with in the Writings of ſome Alchymiſts, yet the thing it ſelſ, being not uſd in Phyſick, is not wont to be known by thoſe that learn Chymiſtry in order to Phyſick; and the way that I uſe in making it is differing from that of Alchymiſts, being purpoſely deſign'd to ſhew ſome notable Phænomena, not to be met with in their way ol proceeding. We take then refined Silver, and having beaten it into thin Plates, and diſſolvd it in abont twice its Weight of good Aqua fortis, we Filtrate it carefully to obtain a clear ſolution, (which ſometimes we Evaporate further, tillit ſhoot into Chryſtals, which we aſterwards dry upon brown Pqæper with a moderate heat.) Upon the abovementiond ſolution we crop good ſpirit of Salt, till we finqã, that it will no more curdle the Liquor it ſalls into, (which will not happen ſo ſoon, as you will be apt at firſt to imagine,) then we put the whole Mixture in a Glaſs Funnel lid with Cap- paper, and letting the moiſture drain through, we dry, with a gentle heat, the ſubſtance, that remains in the Filtre, firſt waſhing it (it need be) from the looſly adhæring Salts, by letting fair Water run through it ſeveral times, whilſt it yet continucs in the Filtree This ſubſtance being well dryd, we put it into a Glaſs Viol, which being put upon quick coals, firſt cover'd with Aſhes, and then freed from them, we melt the contain'd ſubſtance into a Maſs, which, being kept a while in Fuſion, gives us the Luna Cornea we are now to conſiderr l It to make this Factitious Concrete, we fitſt reduce the Siiver intoChryſtals, and afterwards proceed with ſpirit of Salt, as we have juſt now taught you to do with the ſolution, we have the exceedingly Opacous, Malleable, and hardlill ly Fuſible Body of Silver, by the convenient interpoſition of ſome ſaline Particles, not amounting to the third part of the Weight of the Metal, reduc'd into Chryſtals, that both ſhoot in a peculiar and determinate figure, differing from thoſe of other Metals, and alſo are diaphanous and brittle, and by great odds more eaſily fuſible then Silver it ſelf; beſides other Qualities, wherein having elſewhere taken notice, that theſe Chryſtals differ borh from Silver and from Aqua fortis, we ſhall not now inſiſt on them, but paſs to the Qualities, that do more properly belong to the change of the Solution o Silver into Luna Cornea. Firſt then we may obſerve, that though ſpirit of Salt be an highly acid Liquor, and though acid Liquors and Altalys are wont to have quite contrary Operations, the one præcipitating what the other would diſſolve, & diſſolving what the other would præcipitate: yet in our caſe, as neither Oylof Tartar per deliquium, nor ſpirit of Salt ill diſſolve Siiver, ſo both the one and the other will præcipitate it; which I deſire may be taken notice of againſt the Doctrine of the Vulgar Chymiſts, and as a Proof, that the Præcipitation of Bodies depends not upon acid or Alkalizate Liquors as ſuch, but upon the Texture of the Bodies, that happen to be confounded. 2. We may here obſerve, that Whiteneſs and Opacity may be immediately producd by Liquors, both of them Diaphanous and colourleſs. 3. That on the other ſide, a White Powder, though its minute parts appear not tranſparent, like thoſe of beaten Glaſs, Roſin, &c. which, by comminution, are made to ſeem White, may yet, by a gentle heat, be preſently redncd into a Maſs indifferently Tranſparent, and not at all White, but of a fair Yellow. 4. We may obſerve too, that though Silver require ſo ſtrong a fire to melt it, and may be long kept red hot, without being brought to Fuſion; yet by the aſſociation of ſome ſaline particles, conveniently mingled withit, it may be made ſo fuſible, as to be eaſily and quickly melted, either in a thin Viol, or at the flame of a Candle, where it will ſlow almoſt like Wax. 5. It may alſo be noted, that though the Lunar ſolution and the ſpirit of Salt would, either of them apart, have readily diſlolv'd in Water; yet when they are mingled, they do, for the moſt part, concoagulate into a ſubſtance, that will lie undiſſolv'd in Water, and is ſcarce, if at all, ſoluble either in 4uæ fortis, or in ſpirit of Salt. 6. Andremarkable it is, that the Body of Silver being very ſlexible and malleable, (eſpecially if the Metal be, as ours was, refin'd) it ſhould yet, by the Addition of ſo ſmall a proportion of Salt, (a Body rigid and brittle,) as is alſociated to ĩt in our Experiment, be made of a Texture ſo differing from what either of its Ingredients was before, being wholly unlike either a Salt or àa Metal, and very like in Texture to a piece of Horn. And to ſatisſie my ſelf, how much the Toughneſs of this Metalline Horn de pended upon the Texture of the Compoſitum, reſulting from the reſpective Textures of the ſe. veral Ingredients, Ipræcipitated a ſolution of Silver with the diſtill’d ſaline Liquor commonly call'd Oyl of Virtriol, inſtead of ſpirit of ſalt, and having waſrq the Præcipitate ith common Water, I found agreeably to my conjecture, that this Præcipitate, being ©luxd in a moderate heat, afforded a Maſs, that lookd like enough to the Concrete we have been diſcourſing of, but had not its Toughneſs, being brittle enough to be eaſily broken in pieces. But the two Experiment do yet remain unmentiond. For 77$, Tis odd, that whereas æ ſolution of Silver is, as we have oſten occaſion to note, the bittereſt Liquor we have ever met with, and the ſpirit of Salt far ſowrer then either the ſharpeſt Vinegar, or even the ſpirit of it, theſe two ſo ſtrongly and offenſively taſted Liquors ſhould be ſo eaſily and ſpeedily, without any other thing to correct them, be ſeducd into an inſipid ſubſtance, ſat leaſt ſo far inſipid, that Ihave lickd it ſeveral times with my Tongue, without finding it otherwiſe, though perhaps, with much rowling it toand fro in the mouth, it may at Iength afford ſome unpleaſant Taſt, but exceedingly different from that of either of the Liquors jthat compoſtd it:) and This, though the Salts, that made both the Silver, and the præcipitating ſpirit ſo ſtrongly taſted, remaine aſſociated with the Silver. E 8. And Laſtly, it is very ſtrange. that though the ſaline Corpuſcles, that give the efficacy both to good 4-ua fortis, and the like ſpirit of Salt, be not onely ſo volatile, that they will eaſily be diſtill'd with a moderate fire, but ſo fugitive, that they will in part ſly away of themſelves in the cold Air, (as our Noſes can witneſs to our trouble, when the Viols, that contain ſuch Liquors, are unſtopt;) yet by vertue of the new Texture they acquire, by aſſociating themſelves with the Corpuſcles of the Silver and with one another, theſe minute particles of ſalt looſe ſo much of their former Lightneſs, and acquire ſuch a degree òf Fixedneſſe, that they will endure melting with the Metal they adhere to, rather then ſuffer themſelves to be driven away from it. Nor do l remember, that when I melted this Maſs in a thin Viol, I could perceive any ſenſible Evaporation of the Matter: nay having afterwards put a parcel of it upon a quick Coal, though that were blown to intend the heat; yet it ſuſferd Fuſion, and ſo ran off from the Coul, without àppearing, when it was taken up again, to be other then Luna Cornea, as it as before. Experiment IV. I Am now (Pyrophilus) about to doa Thing, contrary enough both to my Cuſtome and Inclination, thatis, To diſcourſe upon the Phænomena of an Experiment, which Ido not teach you to make. But ſince I cannot as yet, without ſome breach of promiſe, plainly diſcloſe to you what I muſt now conceal, your Equity aſſures me of your Pardonn. And as, becauſe the Qualities of the Saſt, I am to ſpeak of, are very remarkable, and pertinent to my preſent deſign, Iam unwilling to paſs them by unmentiond; ſo Ihope, that notwithſtanding their being ſtrange, I may be allowd to diſcourſe upon them to you, who. I preſume, know me too well to ſuſpect I would impoſe upon you n matters of fact, and to whom Iam illing (if you deſire it) to ſhew the Anomalous Salt it ſelf, and Ocular proofs of the chief properties I aſcribe to it. I ſhall not then ſcruple to tell you, that Diſcourſing one day with a very Ingenious Traveller and Chymiſt, who had had extraordinary Opportunities to acquire Secrets, oſa certain odd Salt I had thought upon and made, which was ofſ ſo differing a kind from other Salts, that though Idid uot yet know what Feats Iſhould be able to do withit, yet I was confident, it muſt have Noble and unuſual Operations. This Gentleman, to requite my Franckneſs, told me, that I had lighted on a greater Jewel, then perhaps I was aware of; and that if I would follo his Advice, by adding ſomething that he namd to me, and proſecuting the Preparation a little Iy noble. Tthank'd him, as I had cauſe, tor his Advice, and, when I had Opporiunity, followd it. And though Ifound the vvay of making this Salt ſo nice and intricate a thing, that if Ivvould, ſcould ſcarce eaſily deſcribe it, ſo as to enable moſt men to practice it; yet having once made it, Ifound, that, beſides ſome of the things I had been told it would perform, I could do divers other things vvith it, vvhich ĩ had good cauſe to believe the Gentleman, of whom I was ſpeaking, did not think of; and I doubt not, but I ſnould have done much more with it, if I had not unfortunately loſt it ſoon after I had prepardit. Severalof the Phænomena, Itry'd to produce with it, which are not ſo proper for this place, are reſervd for another, but here Iſall mention a few, that beſt fit my preſent purpoſe. Firſt then, though the ſeveral Ingredients, that compoſtd this Salt, vere all of them ſuch, as Vulgar Chymiſts muſt according to their Principles, look upon as purely Saline, and were each o them far more ſalt then Brine, or mor: ſowr then the ſtrongeſt Vinegar, ormore ſtrongly taſted then either of thoſe two Liquors; yet the Compound, made ip of onely ſuch Bodies, is ſo far from being eminently ſalt, or ſowr, or inſipid, that a Stranger being ask d, what Taſl it had, vvould not ſcruple to judge it rather ſweet, then of any other Taſt: though its Sweetneſs be of a peculiar kind, as there is a difference even among Bodies ſweet by Nature, the ſveetneſs of Sugar being divers from that of Honey, and both of them differing from that of the ſweet Vitriol of Lead And this is the onely inſtance, I remember, I have hitherto met vvith of Salts, that, vvithout the mixture of inſipid Bodies, compoſe a ſubſtance really ſveet. Iſoy really ſmeet, becauſe Chymiſts oftentimes terme the Calces o Metals and other Bodies dulcifid, if they bę freed from all corroſive ſalts and ſharpneſs of Taſt, ſveet, though they have nothing at all of poſitive ſweetneſs in them; and by that licence of ſpeaking do often enough impoſe upon the Unskilful. Another thing conſiderable in our Anomalous Salt is, That though its Odour be not either ſtrong or oſfenſive, ( both which that of Volatile Salts is wont to be,) yet if it be a little urg'd with heat, ſo as to be forcd to evaporate haſtily and copiouſly, Ihave known ſome, that have been uſtd to the power. ful ſtink of Aqua fortis, diſtill'd Urine, and even ſpirit of Sal Armoniack its ſelf, that have complaind ot this ſmell, as more ſtrong, and upon that account more unſupportable then theſe themſelves: and yet when theſe Fumes ſettle again into a Salt, their Odour will again prove mild and inoffenſive, if not pleaſant. Thirdly, whereas all the Volatile, and Acid, and Lixiviate Salts, that we linow of, ire of ſo determinate and ſpecificated a Nature, (if I may ſo ſpeal, ) that there is no one ſort of the three, but may be deſtroyd by ſome one or other of the other two Salts, if not by both, as ſpirit of Urine, which is a volatile Salt, being mingled with ſpirit of Salt, or Aqua fortis, ot almoſt any other ſtrong and acid ſpirit, will malè a great Ebullition, and Jooſe its peculiar Taſt, and ſeveral ofiis other Qualities; and on the otherſide, Salt of Tartar, and other 4lkalys, (that is, Salts produc'd by Incineration of mixd Bodies,) will be deſtroy'd with Ebullition by Aqua fortis, ſpirit of Salt, or almoſt any other ſtrong ſpirit of that Family. And ſpirit of Salt, Aqua fortis, &c. will be ſas they ſpeal)deſtroyd both by Animal volatile Salts, and by the fix'd Salts of Vegetables; that is, will make an Efferveſcence with either ſort of Salts, and compoſe with them a new Liquor or Salt, diftering from either of the ingredients, and, as to taſt, ſmell, odour, and divers other Qualities, more languid and degenerous: whereas, Iſay, each of theſe three Families of Salts may be eaſily deſtroy'd by the other two, our Anomalous Salt ſeems to be above the being thus wrought upon by any of allthe three, and is the onely Body I know: (which is no ſmall priviledge. or rather prerogative,) for I did not find, that a Solution of it, made with as little Water as I could, which is the vvay whereby we uſually make it fluid, would make any Ebullition, either with Oyl of Tartar per Deliqnium, or ſpirit of Sal Armoniack, or ſtrong ſpirit of Salt, or even Oyl of Vitriol, but would calmely and ſilently mix vvith theſe differing Liquors, and continue as long as I had patience to look upon them, without being præcipitated by them. But this is not the onely way Iimployd to examine, whether our Salt belongd to any of the three above mentiond comprehenſive families of Salts. For 7 found not, that the ſtrongeſt ſolution of it would turn Syrup of Violets either red, as acid ſpirits do, or green, as both fix'd and volatile Salts will do. Nor would our Solution turn a clear one of S ublimate made in common Water, either white, as ſpirit of Urine, Sal Armoniack, or others of the ſame family, or into æan Orange Tawny, like ſalt of Tartar, and other Allalys: but left the ſolution of Sublimate tranſparent, without giving it any of theſe colours, mingling it ſelf very kindly with it, as it had done with the four lately mentiond Liquors. And to ſatisfy my ſelfa little further, Inot onely tryd, that an undiſcolourd mixture of ſyrup of Violets and our ſolution, would immediately be turnd red by 2 or3 drops of ſpirit of Salt, or green by as much Oyl of Tartar: but, to proſecute the Experiment, I let fall a drop or two of a mixture made of our Anomalous ſolution, and ſpirit of Salt well ſhaken together, upon ſome ſyrup of Violets, which was thereby immediately turnd red, and a little oſ the ſame Anomalous ſolution, being ſhaken together with Oyl of Tartar per Deliquium, turd another parcel of the ſame ſyrup of Violets into a celightſul green, which, hopning as 7 expected, ſeem'd to argue, that our Solution, though as to ſenſe it were exquiſitely mingled in the ſeveral mixtures, to which I had put it, did, as it leſt them their undeſtroyd reſpective Nutures, retain its own; and yet this Salt is ſo far from being a languiĩ or an inſignificant thing, that Aqua fortis,and Oyl of Vitriol themſelves, as operative and as furious Liquors as they are, are unable in divers caſes to make ſuch Solutions, and perform ſuch other things, as our calme, but powerful, Menſtruum can, though but ſlowly, effect. Fourthly: Though this Salt be a volatile one, and requires no ſtrong heat to make it ſublime into finely figurd Chryſtals without a remanence at the Bottom, yet being diſſolvd in Liquors, v ou may make the Solution, if need be, to boile, without making any of the Salt ſublime up, before the Liquor be totally or almoſt totally drawn off, whereas the volatile ſalt of Urine, Bloud, Harts- horn, &c. are wont to aſcend betore almoſt any part of the Liquor, they are diſſolvd in, which is in many caſes very inconvenient. And though this be a Volatile ſalt, vet Iremember not, that I have obſervd any ſix'd ſalt, (without excepting ſalt of Tartar it ſelf,) that runs near ſo ſoon per Deliquium, as this will do; but by abſtraction of the adventitious moiſture tis eaſily reſtor'd to its former ſoline form: and yet differs from ſalt of Tartar, not onely in Fixedneſſe and Taſt, and divers other qualities, but alſo in this, That, whereas lalt of Tartar requires a vehement fire to flux it, ⸗ gentlier heat, then one would eaſily imagine, gine, will melt our Salt into a Limpid Liquor, And whereas ſpirit of Wine will dilſolve ſome Bodies, as Sanderick, Moſtick, Gum- Lac, &c. and Water, onthe other ſide, diſſolves many that ſpirit of Wine cannot, and Oyls will diſſolve ſome, for which neither of the other Liquors are good ſolvents; our ſaſt will readily diſſolve both in fair Water, in the higheſt rectiſi'd ſpirit of Wine, ſand That ſo little, as not to weigh more then the ſalt,) and in Chymical Oyls themſelves, with which it will æſlociate its ſelf very ſtrictly, and perhaps more too, then I have yet found any other conſiſtent ſalt to do. Experiment V. T He Experiment I am (Pyrophilus) now about to deliver, though I have not yet had Opportunity to perfect õns, thãt I have about Fire and Salt, ſuggeſted ĩt to me, is yet ſuch as may far more clearly, then almoſt any of the Experiments commonly nown to Chymiſts, ſerve to ſhew us, how near to à real Tranſmutation thoſe Changes may prove, that may be effected even in. inanimate, and, which is more, ſcarce corruptible Bodies, by the receſs of ſome Particles, and the acceſs of ſome others, and the new Texture of the reſidue. The Experiment I have made ſeveral wayes, but one of the lateſt and beſt I have uſd is this: Take one part ofgood Sea. ſalt well dry’d and powder'd, and put to it double its weight of good aqua fortis, or ſpirit of Nitre, then haveing kept it ſif you have time) for ſome while in a previous digeſtion, diſtill it over with a ſlow fire ina Retort or a Jow Body, till the the remaining Matter be quite dry, and no more; for this ſubſtance, that will remain in the bottom of the Glaſs, is the thing that is ſought foro This This Operation being performable in a moderate fire, and the Bodies themſelves being almoſt of an incorruptible nature, one would ſcarce think, that ſo ſlight a matter ſhould produce any Change in them; but yet I found, as I expected, theſe notable Mutations of Qualities effected by ſo unpromiſing a ay. For ĩn the firſt place, we may take notice, that the Liquor, that came over, was no longer an Aqua fortis, or ſpirit of Nitre, but an 4qua Regis, that was able to diſſolve Gold, which 49ua fortis will not meddle with, and will not diſſolve Silver, as it would have done before, but will rather, as I have purpoſely tryd, præcipitate it out of Aqua fortis, if that Menſtruum have already diſſolvd it: but this Change belonging not ſo properly to the ſubſtance it ſelf I was about to conſider, I ſhall not here inſiſt on it2. Then, the Taſt of this Subſtance comes by this Operation to be very much alterd. For it hath not that ſtrong ſaltneſs that it had before, but taſts far milder, and, though it relliſo of both, aſfects the Palate much more like Saltpetre, then like common ſalt. 3. Next, whereas this laſt namd Body is of very difficult Fuſion, our factitious ſalt imitates ſalt- petre in being very fuſible, and it will, like Nitre, ſoon melt, by being held in the flame oſ a Candle. l 4- But to proceed to a more conſiderable Phænomenon, tis known, that Sea- ſalt is a Body, that doth very much reſiſt the fire, when once by heing brought to Fuſion, it hath been forcd to let go that windy ſubſtance, that makes unbeaten ſalt crackle in the fire, and ſo by blowing it accidentally increaſe it. Tis alſo known, that acid ſpirits, as thoſe of Salt, Vitriol, Nitre, Vinegar, &c. are not onely not inſ=lammoble themſelves, but hinderers of inflamllll mation in other Bodies, and yet my Conjecture leading me to expect, that, by this Operation, I ſhould be able to produce, out of two inflammable Bodies, a third, that would be eaſily inſlammable. Ifound, upon Tryal, not onely that ſmall Lumps of this ſubſtance; caſt upon quick and well blown coals, though they did not give ſo blew à flame as Nitre, did yet, like it, burn away with a copious and vehement flame. And, for further Tryal, having melted a pretty quantity of this tranſmuted Sea ſalt in a Crucible, by caſting upon It little fragments of well kindled Charcoal, it would, like Nitre, preſently be kindled, and aftord a flame ſo vehement and ſo dazling, that one that had better Eyes then I, and knew not what it was, complaind, that he was not able to ſupport the ſplendor ofit. Nor were all its inflammable parts conſumd at one deflagration: for by caſting in more fragments of well kindled Coal, the Matter would fall a puſfing, and flame afreſh for ſeveral times conſecutively, according to the quantity that had been put into the Crucible. 5. But this it ſelf was not the chief diſcovery I deſign'd by this Experiment. For I pretended hereby to deviſe a way of turning an acid ſalt into an Alkaly, which ſeems to be one of the greateſt and difficulteſt Changes, that is rationally to be attempted among durable and inanimate Bodies. For tis not unknown to ſuch Chymiſts as are any thing inquiſitive and heedful, how vaſt a difference there is between acid Salts, and thoſe, that are made by the combuſtion of Bodies, and are ſometimes call'd Fixd, ſometimes Alkalizate. For whereas ſtrong Lixiviums ( which are but ſtrong ſolutions of Altalys) will readily enough diſſolve common Sulhur, and. divers other Bodies abounding with Sulphur; even thoſe highly acid Liquors, Aqua fortis, and Aqua Regis, though ſo corroſive, that one will diſſolve Silver, and the other Gold it ſelf, will let Brimſtone lye in them undiſſolvd I know not how long, though ſome ſay, that in proceſs of time, there may be ſome Tincture drawn by the Menſtruum fromit, hich vet I havenot ſeen tryd; and though iſt were true, would yet ſufficiently argue a great diſparity betwixt thoſe acid ſpirits, and ſtrong Alkalizate ſolutions, which will ſpeedily diſſolve the very maſſe of common Sulphur. Beſides, tis obſerv'd by the inquiſitive Chymiſts, nor does my Experience contradict it, that the Bodies, that are diſſolvd by an acid Menſtruum, may be præcipitated by an AlIcalizate; and on the contrary, ſolutions, made by the Iatter, may be præcipitated by the former. Moreover, as Litharge, diſſolv'd in ſpirit of Vinegar, will be præcipitated by the Ovlot Tartar per Duliquium, or the ſolution of its Salt, and, on the contrary, Sulphur or Antimony, diſſolv'd in ſuch a ſolution, will be præcipitated out of it hy the ſpirit of Vinegar, or even common Vinegar. Moreover, Acids and Alkalizates do alſo differ exceedingly in taſt, and in this greater diſparity, that the one is volatile, and the other fixd, beſides other particulars not neceſſary here to be inſiſted on. And indeed, iſ that were truèe, which is taught in the Schools, that there is a natural enmity, as well as diſparity betwixt ſome Bodies, as between Oyly and wateriſh ones, the Chymiſts may very ſpeciouſly teach, (as ſome of them do) That there is a ſtrange contrariety betwixt Acid and Alkalizate Salts; as when there is made an Affuſion of oyl of Tartar upon Aqua Regis, or Aqua fortis, to præcipitate Gold out of the one, and Silver out of the other, their mutual Hoſtility ſeems manifeſtly to ſhew it ſelf, not onely by the noiſe, and heat, and fume, that are immediately excited by their conſlict, but by this moſt of all, that afierwards the two contending Bodies will appear to have mutually deſtroyd one ànother, both the ſowr Spirit and the fixt Salt having each loſt its former Nature in the ſcuffle, and degenerated with its Adverſary into a certain Third ſubſtance, that wants ſeveral of the Properties both of the ſowr Spirit and the Alkaly. Now to apply all this to the Occaſion, on which I mentiond it, how diſtant and contrary ſoever the more inquiſitive of the latter Chymiſts take Acid and Fixed Salts to be; yet I ſcarce doubted, but that, by our Experiment, I ſhould, from acid ſalts, obtain an Alkaly, and accordingly having, by caſting in ſeveral bits oſ well kindled coal, excited, in the melted Maſs of our tranſmuted Salt, as many Deflagrations as I could, and then giving it a pretty ſtrong fire to drive away the reſt of the more fugitive parts, I judgd, that the remaining Maſſe would be (like the ſix'd Nitre I have elſewhere mention'd) of an Alkalizate nature, and accordingly having taken it out, I foundit to taſt, not like Sea- ſalt, but fiery enough upon the Tongue, and to have a Lixiviate reliſh. Ifound too, that it would turn Syrup of Violets into a greeniſh colour, that it would præcipitate a Limpid ſoJution of Sublimate, made in fair water, into an Orange tawny Powder. Ifound, that it would, like other ſix'd ſalis, produce an Ebullition with acid ſpirits, and even with ſpirit of ſalt it ſelf, and concoagulate with them. Nor are theſe themſelves all the wayes Itook to manifeſt the Alkalizate Nature of our tranſmuted Sea ſalt. I did indeed conſider at firſt, that it might be ſuſpected, that this new Alkalizateneſſe might proceed from the Aſhes of the injected Coals, the Aſhes of Vegetables generally containing in them more or leſſe ofa fix'd Salt. But when I conſider'd too, that a pound of Charcoal, burn'd to Aſhes, is wont to vield ſo very little Salt, that the injected fragments of Coal, (though they had been, which they were not) quite burnd out in this Operation, would ſcarce have afforded two or three grains of ſalt, (perhaps not half ſo much,) I ſaw no reaſon at all to believe, that in the whole Maſs I had obtain'd (and which was all, that was left me of the Sea- ſalt, Ihad at firſt imployd,) it was nothing but ſo inconſiderable a proportion of Aſhes, that exhibited all the Phænomena of an Altaly. ll And for further confirmation both of This, and what I ſaid a little before, I ſhall adde, that to ſatisfie my ſelf yet more, I pour'd, upon a pretty quantity of this Lixiviate ſalt, a due proportion of Aqua fortis, till the hiſſing and ebullition ceaſed, and then leaving the ſluid Mixture for a good while to coaguIate, (which it did very ſlowly,) I found ſtals, which though they were not of the figure of Nitre, did yet, by their in. flammability and their bigneſs, ſufficiently argue, that there had been a Con. junction made betwixt the Nitrous ſpirit, and a conſiderable proportion of Altaly. I conſiderd alſo, that it might be ſuſpected, that in our Experiment twas the Nitrous Corpuſcles of the A4qua fortis, that, lodging themſelves in the little rooms deſerted by the ſaline Corpuſcles of the Sea- ſalt, that paſs d over into the Receiver, had afforded this 4lkaly, as common Salt. petre, being handled after ſuch a manner, would leave in the Crucible a fix'd or Altalizate Salt. But to this Ianſwer, that as the Sea- ſalt, which was not driven over by ſo mild a Diſtillation, and ſeemd much a greater part then that which had paſ'd over, was far from being of an Alkalizate nature: ſo the Nitrous Corpuſcles, that are preſum d to have ſtayd behind, were whilſt they compoſd the ſpirit of Nitre, of an highly volatile and acid Nature, and conſequently of a nature directly oppoſite to that of Alkalys;, and if by the addition of any other ſubſtance, that were no more Altalizate then Seoſalt, an Alkalycould be obtaind out of ſpirit of Nitre or Aqua fortis, the Producibleneſs of an a4lkaly out of Bodies of another nature might be rightly thence inferrd: ſo that however, it appears, that by the intervention of our Experiment, two Subſtances, that were formerly acid, are turnd into one, that is manifeſtly of an Altalizate Nature, which is That we would here evince. Pe: haps it may (ryrophilus) be worth while to ſubjoyn; That to proſecute the Experiment by inverting it, we drew two parts of ſtrong ſpirit of Salt from one of purifi'd Nitre; but did not obſervc the remaining Body to be any thing neer ſo conſiderably chang'd as the Seã. ſalt, from which we had drawn the ſpirit of Nitre; ſince though the ſpirit of Salt, that came over, did ſas we expected) bring over ſo many of the Corpuſcles of the Nitre, that, being heated, it would readily enough diſſolve foliated Gold, yet the Salt, that remaind in the Retort, being put upon quick Coals, did flaſh away with a vehement and halituous flame, very like that of common Nitre. Experiment VlI. ] Come now (Pyrophilus) to an Experiment, which, though in ſome things it be of kin to that which Ihave already taught you, concerning the changing of Sea- ſalt by Aqua fortis,will yet afford us divers other inſtances, to ſhew, how upon the change of Texture in Bodies, there may ariſe divers new Qualities, eſpecially of that ſort, which, becauſe they are chiefly producd by Chymiſtry, and are wont to be conſt der'd by Chymiſts, ifnot by Them onely, may in ſome ſenſe be call'd Chymical. The Body, which, partly whilſt we were preparing it, and partly when we had prepard it, afforded us theſe various Phænomena, either is the ſame that Glauberus means by his sal Mirabilis; or at leaſt ſeems to be very like it: and whether it be the ſame or no, its various and uncommon Properties make it very fit to have a place allowd it in this Treatiſe. Though of the many Tryals I made with it, I can at preſent ſind no more among my Iooſe Papers, then that following part of it, that I wrot ſome years ago to an Ingenious Friend, who I know will not be diſpleaſſq, if, to ſavæ my ſelt ſome time, and the trouble of Examining my Memory, I annex the following Tranſcript of it.  To give you a more particular account of what I writ to you from Oxford of my Tryais about Glaubers Salt, though Idare not ſay, that Ihave made the ſelf ſame Thing, which he cals his sal Mirabilis, becauſe he has deſcribd it ſo darkly and àZmbiguouſly, that tis not eaſie to know with any certainty what he means; yet whether or no I have not made Salt, that, as far as I have vet trydit, agrees well enough with what he delivers of His, and therefore is like to prove either his Sal mirabilis, or almoſt as good a one, I ſhall leave you to judge by this ſhort Narrative, The ſtrange things that the Induſtrious Glaubers Writings have invited Men to expect from his Sal mirabilis, in caſe he be indeed poſſeſſ-d of ſuch a thing, and the Enquiries of divers Eminent Men, who would fain learn of me, what I thought of its Realitv and Nature, in. vited me, the next Opportunity I got, to take into. my hands his Pars altera Miraculi Mundi, hoſe Title you know promiſes a Deſcription ofthis Sal Artis mirificum, as he is pleaſd to callit- But, T conſeſs, Idid not read it near all over, becauſe a great part of it is but a Tranſcription of ſeveral entire Chapters out of Paracelſus, and I perceiv'd, that much of the reſt did, according to the cuſtome or Chymical Writings, more concern the Author, then the ſubject; wherefore lIooking upon his proceſs of making his ſal mirabilis, I ſoon perceivd he had no mind to make it common, fince he onely bids us upon two parts of common Salt diſſolv'd in common Water, to pour 4, without telling us what that 4 is, wherefore reading on in the ſame proceſſe, and finding that he tels us, that with B (which he likewiſe explaines not at all, nor determines the quantity of It) one may male an Aqua fortis, it preſently call'd into my mind, That ſome Years before, having had Occaſion to make many Tryals, mentiond in other Tracts of mine, with Oyl of Vitriol and Salt petre, I did, among other things, make a red ſpirit of Nitre, by the help onely of Oyl of Vitriol; remembring ThisſI ſay) Ireſorted to one of my Carneades's Dialogues, *and reviewing that Experiment, as I have ſet it down, I concluded, That though I had not diſe ſolv'd the Salt petre in Water, as Glauber doth his common Salt; yet ſince, on the other ſide, I made uſe of external fire, twas probable I might this way alſo get a Nitrous ſpirit, though not ſo ſtrong. And though by calling the Liquor, that muſt make an 4qua fortis B, whereas he had call'd that, which is to male his ſpirit of Salt and ſal mirabilis, A, he ſeemd plainly to make them differing things, yet relying on the Experiment Ihad made, and putting to a ſolution of Nitre as much of the Oyl of Vitriol as I had taken Iaſt, though That be double the quantity he preſcribes for the making of his Sal mtrabilis, I obtaind, out of a low glaſſe Body and Head placd in Sand, an indiſo Sce the 5ceptical Chymiſt. ferentgood Spiritus Nitri, that even before Rectification would readily enough diſſolve Silver, though it were diluted with as much of the common Water, wherein Salt. petre had been diſſolvd, as amounted at leaſt to double or treble the weight of the Nitrous parts, the remaining Matter, being kept in the ſire tillit was dry, afforded us a Salt eaſily reducible (by Solution in fair Water and Coagulation)into ChryItalline Grains, ofa nature very differing both from crude Nitre, and from fixt Nitre, and from Oyl oſ Vitriol. For it coagulated into pretty. big and well ſhap’d. Grains, which, you know, ſix'd Nitre and other altalizate Salts are not wont to do;. and theſe Graines were not like the Chryſtals of Salt-petre it ſelf; long and Hexaedrical, but ot another figure, not eaſie nor neceſſlary to be here deſcribedl(n-{l DBeſides, this Vitriolate Nitre ũf I ſlow in the Air, as fixt Nitre is vvont to do. Moreovẽr, it was eaſily enough fuſible by heat, vvhereas fixd Nitre doth uſually exact a vehement Fire for its Fuſion; and though crude Salt- petre alſo melts eaſily, yet to ſatisfie you how differing a ſubſtance this of ours was from That, vve caſt quick Coals imnto the Crucible, without being at all able to kindle itt. Nay, and vvhen, for fur. ther Tryal, vve threw in ſome Sulphur alſo, though it did flame away it ſelf, vet did it not ſeem to kindle the Salt, that was hot enough to kindle It; much leſs did it flaſh, as Sulphur is wont on ſuch occaſions to make Salt- petre do. Add to all this, That a parcel of this white ſubſtance, being, vvithout Brimſtone, made to flow for a vvhile in a Crucible, with a bit of Charcoal for it to vvork upon, grew manifeſtlyand ſtrongly ſented of Sulphur, and acquird an Alkalixate Taſt, ſo that it ſeemd almoſt a Coal of fire upon the Tongue, if it were licld before it imbibd any oſ the Aires moiſture, and (which many perhaps will, though I do not, think ſtranger)obtain'd alſo a very red colour; which recall'd to my mind, that Glauber mentions ſuch a Change obſervable in his Salt, made of common Salt, upon whoſe Account he is pleaſd to call ſuch a ſubſtance his Carbunculus. Being invited by this ſucceſs to try, whether I could make his Sal mirabilis, notwithſtanding his intimating, as I lately told you, that it is done with a differing Menſtruum from that, wherewith the Salt-petre is to be wrought upon; I obſervd, that where he points at a way of making his Salt in quantity without breaking the Veſſels, he preſcribes, that the Materials be diſtill'd in Veſſels of pure Silver; vvhence Iconjectur'd, that 'twas not Aqua fortis, or ſpirit of Nitre, that he imployd to open his Sea- ſalt: and that conſequently, ſince common ſpirit of Salt was tòo weals to effect ſo great a Change, as the Experiment requires, stwas very prob⸗ble, that he imployd Oyl of Sulphur, or of Vitriol, vvhich vvill ſcarce at all fret unalloyd Silver. And however I concluded, that whatſoever the Event ſhould prove, it could not but be worth the While to try, vvhat Operation ſuch a Menſtruum vvould have upon Se⸗ſalt, as I vvas ſure had ſuch a notable one upon ſalt petre. And Iremember, that formerly making ſome Experiments about the differing manners oſ Diſſolution of the ſame Concrete by ſeveral Liquors, I found, that Oyl of Vitriol diſſolves Sea. ſalt ina very odd way, (vvhich you vvill find mentiond among my promiſcuous Experiments,) vvherefore pouring, upon a ſolution of Bay-ſalt, made in but a moderate proportion of Water, Oyl of Vitriol to the full Weight of the dry Salt, and abſtracting the Liquor in a Glaſs Cucurbite plac'd in Sand, Iobtaind, without (343 ſtreſs of fire, beſides flegme, good ſtore of a Liquor, vvhich, by the Smel and Taſt, ſeem d to be ſpirit of Salt. And to ſatisfie my ſelf the better, mingling a little of it vvith ſome of the fpirit of Nitre lately mentiond, Ifound the mixture, even without the Aſſiſtance of Heat, to diſſolve crude Gold. And having, for ſurther Tryals ſake, pourd ſome ofit upon ſpirit of fermented Lrine, till the Aſfuſion ceaſ'd to produce any Conſlict, and having afterwards gently evaporated away the ſuperfluous moiſture, there did, as I expected, ſhoot, in the remaining Liquor, a Salt figurd like Combs and Feathers, thereby diſcloſing it ſelf to be much of the nature of Sal Armoniack, ſuch as I elſewhere relate my having made, by mingling ſpirit of Urine vvith ſpirit of common Salt, made the ordinaryway. TThis ( Pyrophilus) is all Ican find at preſent of that Account, of vvhich I hopd to have found much more; but you will be the more unconcern d, for my not adding divers other things, that, I remember, Itryd, as vvell betore and after the vvriting the above tranſscribJd Paper, (as particularly, that found the Experiment ſometimes to ſucceed not ill, when I diſtill'd the Oyl of Vitriol and Sea- ſalt together, without the intervention of Water, (Whereby much time was ſav'd,) and alſo when I imploy’d Oyl of Sulphur, made with à Glaſs Bell, in ſtead of Oyl of Vitriol,) If I intorm You, that aſterwards I found, that Glauber himſelf, in ſome of his ſubſequent pieces, had deliver'd more intelligibly the Way of making what he, without altogether ſo great a Brag, as moſt think, calls his Sal mirabilis, (which yet ſome very ingenious Readers of his Writings have come to Us to teach them,) and that thoſe Experiments of his about it, which I vvas able to make ſucceed, (for ſome Ias not, and ſome I did not thin fit to try) you will find, together with thoſe of my Own, in more proper places of other Papers. Onely, to apply what hath been above related to my preſent purpoſe, 7 muſt not here pretermit a couple of Obſervations. And firſt we may take notice of the power, that Mixtures, though they ſeem but very ſlight, & conſiſt of the ſmalle ſt number of ingredients, may, i theymake great changes of Texture, have, in altering the Nature and Qualities of the compounding Bodies. For in our(above recited) caſe, though Sea-ſalt be a Body conſiderably fix'd, requires a naked Fire to be elevated even by the help of copious additaments of beaten Bricks, or Clay, &c. to keep it from Fuſion, yet the ſaline Corpuſcſes are diſtill'd over in à moderate Fire of Sand, whilſt the Oyl of Vitriol, by whoſe intervention they acquire this volatility, though it be not ?ike the other) a Groſſe or ũ;s the ſame Chymiſt ſpeaks corporeal ſalt, but a Liquor, that has been already di. ſtill/d, is yet, by the ſame operation, ſo fixd, as to ſtay behind, not onely in the Retort, but, as I have ſometimes purpoſely try'd, in much conſiderabler heats then That needs in this Experiment be expoſd to. Nor onely is the oyl of Vitriol made thus far fix'd, but it is otherwiſe alſo no leſs chang:d. For when the remaining Salt has been expoſd to a competent heat, that it may be very drie and white, to be ſure ofwhich, I ſeveral times do, when the Diſtillationis ended, Ekeep the remaining Maſſe (taken out of the Retort and beaten) in a Crucible among quick coals, you ſhall have a conſiderable quantity (perhaps near as much as the Sea- ſalt You firſt imployd) of a Subſtance, which, though not inſipid, has not at all the taſt of Sea- ſalt, or any other pungent one, and much leſſe the highly corroſive acidity of Oyl of Vitriol. And the mention of this ſubſtance leads me to the ſecond particular I intended to take notice of, which is a Phænomenon to confirme what I formerly intimated, That notwithſtanding the regular and exquiſite figures of ſome Salts, they may, by the addition of o. ther Bodies, be brought to conſtitute Chryſtals of very diftering, and yet of curious, ſnapes. For if You diſſolve the hitherto mention'd Caput mortuum of Sea ſalt (after You have made it very dry, and freed it from all pungency of Taſt) in a ſufficient quantity of fair water, and, having filtrated the ſolution, ſuff.r the diſſolvd Body leiſurely to coagulate, You will probably obtain, as Ihave often done, Chryſtals of a far greater Tranſparency, then the Cubes wherein Sea ſalt is wont to ſoot, and of a ſhape ſar differing from theirs, though oftentimes no leſſe Curious then that of thoſe Cubes; and, which makes mainely for my preſent purpoſe, Ihave often obſerv'd thoſe finely figur'd Chryſtals to diſter as much in ſhape from one another, as from the Graines of common Salt. And indeed I muſt not, on this occaſion, conceal from You, that whether it be to be imputed to the peculiar Nature of Sea ſalt, or (whichII judge much more probable) to the great diſparities to be met with in Liquors, that do all of them paſs for Oyl of Vitriol, whether U ſay) it be to this, or to ſome other cauſe, that the Effect is ro be imputed, I have found my Attempts, to make the beſt ſort of Sal mirabilis, ſubject to ſo much incertainty, that though Ihave divers times ſucceeded in them, Ihave found ſo little Uniformity in the ſucceſs, as made me recIton this Experiment amongſt Contingent ones, and almoſt weary of medling with it. Experiment vII.* I Remember (Pyrophilus) I once made an Experiment, which, if I had had the Opportunity to repeat, and had done ſo with the like ſucceſs, I ſould be tempted to look uponit, though not as a Lucriferous Experiment, (for tis the quite contrary,) vet as ſo Luciferous a one, as, how much ſoever it may ſerve to recommend Chymiſtry it ſelf, may no leſſe diſpleale Envious Chymiſis, who will be troubled, both that one, who admits not their Principles, ſhould æ Though this VII. Experiment, being conſiderable and very pertinent, the Author thought fit to mention it, ſuch as it is here delivered, when he writ but to a private friend; yet, after he was inducd to publiſh theſe Papers, twas the (no raging) Plague, which drove him from the Accommodations requiſite to his purpoſe, that fruſtrated the Deſi gne he had of firſt repeating that part of the Experiment, which treats of the Deſtruction of Gold: for as for that part, which teaches the Volatilization of it, he had tryed Thæ often enough before. deviſe ſuch a thing, and that having found it, he ſhould not (Chymiſt like) Leep it ſecret. But to give youa plain and naked Account of this matter, that you may be able the better to judge of it, and, if You pleaſe, to repeat it, I will freely tell You, That ſuppoſing all Metals, as well as other Bodies, to be made of one Catholick Matter common to them all, and to differ but in the ſape, ſie, motion or reſt, and texture of the ſmall parts they conſiſt of, from which Affections of Matter, the Qualities, that difference particular Bodies, reſult, Icould not ſee any impoſſibility in the Nature of the Thing, that one kind of Metal ſhould be tranſmuted into another; (that being in eſfet no more, then that one Parcel of the Univerſal Matter, wherein all Bodies agree, may have a Texture produc'd in it, like the Texture of ſome other Parcel of the Matter common to them both,) . And having ſirſt ſuppoſdd this, I further conſiderd; That in a certain Menſtruum, which, according to the vulgar Chymiſts doctrine, muſt be a worthleſ™ Liquor, according to my apprehenſion there muſt be an extraordinary efficacy in reference to Gold, not onely to diſſolve, and otherwiſe alter it, but to injure the very Texture of that ſuppoſedly immutable Metal. The Menſtruum then Ichoſe to try whether I could not diſſolve Gold with. is made by pouring on the rectifi'd oyl of the Butter of Antimony as much ſtrong ſpirit of Nitre, as would ſerve to præcipitate out oſ it all the Beæoarticum Minerale, and then with a good ſmart Fire diſtilling oft all the Liquor, that would come over, and ſif need be] Cohobatiug it upon the Antimonial powder. For though divers Chymiſts, that make this Liquor, throw it away, upon Preſumption, that, becauſe of the Ebullition, that is made by the Affuſion of the ſpirit to the Oyl, and the conſequent precipitation of a copious Powder, the Liquors have mutually deſtroy'd or diſarmd each other; yet my Notions and Experience of the Nature of ſome ſuch Mixtures invites me to prize this, and give it the name of Menstruum peracitum. Having then provided a ſufficient quantity of this Liquor, (for I have obſervd that Gold ordinarily requires a far more copious Solvent then Silver,) we took a quantity of the beſt Gold we could get, and melted it with 3 or 4 times its weight of Copper, which Me. tal we chooſe rather then that which is more uſual among the Refiners, Silver, that there may be the leſſe ſuſpicion, that there remain'd any Silver with the Gold, after their ſeparation; this Mixture we put into good Aqua fortis, or ſpirit of Nitre, that all the Copper being diſſolv]d, the Gold might be leſt pure and finely powderd at the bottom; this Operation with 4qua fortis being accounted the beſt way of refining Gold that is yet known, and not ſubject, like Lead, to leave any Silver with it, ſince the Aqua fortis takes up that Metal. And for greater ſecurity, we gave the Powder to an Ancient Chymiſt, to boile ſome more of the Men. ſtruum upon it, without communica. ting to him our Deſign. This highly refi’d Gold being, hy a competent degree of heat, brought, as is uſual, to its Native Colour and Luſtre, we puttoit a large Proportion of the Menſtruum peracutum, (co which we have ſometimes found cauſe to adde a little ſpirit of Salt, to promote the Solution,) wherein it diſſolves ſlowly and quietly enough; and there remaind at the bottom of the Glaſſe a pretty quantity (in ſhew, though not in weight) of white Powder, that the Menſtruum would not touch, and, if I much miſremember not, we found it as indiſſoluble in Au⸗ Regis too: The Solution of Gold being abſtracted, and the Gold again reducd into a Body, did, upon a ſecond Solution, yield more oſ the white Powder, but not (it Iremember aright) ſo much as at the firſt; now having ſome little quantity oſ this Powder, twas eaſie with Borax or ſome other convenient Flux, to melt it down into a Metal, which Metal we found to be white like Silver, and yielding to the Hammer, if not toa leſę preſſure, and ſome of it, being diſſolvd in Aqua fortis or ſpirit of Nitre, did, by the odious Bitterneſs it producd, ſuffici ently confirm us in our Expectation, to find it true Silver. I doubt not, but you will demand (Pyrophilus) why I did not make other Tryals with this Factitious Metal, to ſee in how many other Qualities I could veriſie ĩt to be Silver, but the quantity Irecoverd after Fuſion was ſo ſmali, ſome of it perhaps being left either in the Flux, or in the Crucible, that Ihad not wherewithall to make many Tryals, and being well enough ſatisfied by the viſible Properties, and the Taſt peculiar to Silver, both that it was a Metal, and rather Silver then any other, Iwas willing to keep the reſt of it for a while, as a Rarity, before.I made further Tryals with it; but was ſo unfortunate, as with it to looſe it in a little Silver Box, where I had ſomething of more Value, and poſſibly of more Curioſity. You will alſoask, why Irepeated not the Experiment? to which Iſhall anſwer, that, beſides that one may eaſily enough faile in making the Menſtruum fit for my purpoſe, I did, when I had another Opportunity, (for I was long without it,) make a Second Attempt; and having, according to the above mentiond Method, brought it ſo far, that there remaind nothing but the melting of the White Powder into Silver, when having waſh'd it, I had layd it upon a piece of white Paper by the fires ſide to dry, being ſuddenly call'd out of my Chamber, an ignorant Maid, that in the mean time came to dreſs it up, unluckily ſwept this Paper, as a foul one, into the fire: which Diſcouragement, together with multiplicity of Occaſions, have made me ſuſpend the Purſuit of this Experiment, till another Opportunity. But in the mean time Iwas confirmd in ſome part of my Conjecture by theſe Things. 3ll The ſirſt, by finding, that with ſome other Menſtruums. which I try’d, and even with good 4qua Regis it ſelf, I could obtain from the very beſt Gold, I diſſolv'd in them, ſome little quantity of ſuch a White Powder, as Iwas ſpeaking of; but in ſo very ſmall a proportion to the diſſolv'd Gold, that Ihad never enough of it at once, to think it worth proſecuting Tryals with. The other was this. That a very Experiencd Mineraliſt, whom I had acquainted with part of what Ihad done, aſſurd me, that an eminently Learned and Judicious perſon, that he namd t] me, had, by diſſolving Goldin a certain kind of Aqua Regis, and after by reduction of it into a Body, rediſſoſving it again, and repeating this Operation veIy oſten, reduc'd a very great, if not much the greater, part of an Ounce of Gold into ſuch a White Powder. And the Third thing, that confirmd me, was, the Proof given me by ſome Tryals that I purpoſely made; That the Menſtruum peracutum I imployd. had à notable Operation upon Gold, and would perform ſome things (one of which we ſhall by and by mention, which Judicious Men, that play the great Criticks in Chymiſtry, do not think feaſible: ſo that there ſeems no greater cauſe to doubt, that the above mentiond Silver was really obtaind out of the pure Gold, then onely this, That Men have hitherto ſo often in vain attempted to make à real Eiabitnuta of Metals, (for the better or ſor the worſe,) and to deſtroy the moſt fixd and compacted Body of Gold, that the one is look'd upon às an Unpracticable Thing, and the other as an Indeſtructible Metal. E To reſiect then a little upon what we have been relating, if we did not miſtake nor impoſe upon our ſelves,  ſay, upon our Selves, the Project being our own, and purſued without acquainting any body with our Aime,) it may afford us very conſiderable Conſequences of great moment. And in the Firſt place, it ſeems probably reducible from hence, that however the Chymiſts are wont to talke irrationall; enough of what they call Tinctura Auri, and Anima Auri; yet, in a ſober ſenſe, ſome ſuch thing may be admitted, Iſay, ſome ſuch ithing, becauſe as on the one hand, I would not countenance their wild Fancies about theſe matters, ſome of them being as uninli telligible, as the Peripateticks ſubſtantial Forms, ſo, on the other hand, Ivould not readily deny, but that there may be ſome more noble and. ſubtle Corpuſcles, being duely conjoyn'd with the reſt of the Matter, whereof Gold conſiſts, may qualifie that Matter to look Yellow, to reſiſt Aqua fortis, and to exhibit thoſe other peculiar Phænomena, that diſcriminate Gold from Silver, and yet theſe Noble parts may either have their Texture deſtroy'd by a very piercing Menſtruum, or by a greater congruity with ſts Corpuſcles, then with thoſe of the remaining part of the Gold, may ſtick more cloſer to the former, and by their means be extricated and drawn away from the latter. As when (to explain my meaning by a groſs Example) the Corpuſcles of Sulphur and Mercury do, by a ſtrict Coalition, aſſociate themſelves into the Body we call Vermilion, though theſe willriſe together in Sublimatory Veſſels, without being divorcd by the fire, and will act, in many caſes, as one Phyſical Body: et tis known enough among Chymiſts, That if You exquiſitely mix with it a due proportion of Salt of Tartar, the parts oſ the A4ltaly will aſſociate themſelves more ſtrictly with thoſe of the Sulphur, then theſe were before aſſociated with thoſe of the Mercury, whereby You ſhall obtain out of the C innabar, which ſeæm d intenſely red, a real Mercury, that will look like fluid Silver. And this Example prompts me to mind You, (Pyrophilus) That, at the beginning of this Paragraph,. I ſaid no more, then that the Conſequence, I have been deducing, might probably be inferrd from the Premiſes. For as tis not abſurd to think, that our Menſtruum may have a particular Operation upon ſome Noble, and (if I may ſo call them) ſome Tinging parts of the Gold, ſo it is not impoſſible, but that the Yellowiſhneſs of that rich Metal may proceed not from any particulai Corpuſcles of that Colour, but from the Texture of the Metal, as in our lately mention'd Example, the Cinnabar was highly Red, though the Mercury, it conſiſted of, were Silver- coloured, and the Sulphur but a pale Yellow; and conſequently, the Whiteneſs, and other Changes, producd in the nev Metal we obtaind, may beattributednot to the Extraction of any tinging Particles, but to a Change oſ Texture, whereon the Colour, as well as other Properties of the Gold did depend. But That, which made me unilling to reject the way, I firſt propoſed, of explicating this Change of Colour, was, That a Mineraliſt of great Veracity hath ſeveral times aſſurd me, that a known Perſon in the Relators Country, the Netherlands, got a great deal of Money by the way of Extracting a Blew Tincture out of Copper, ſo as to leave the Body White, adding, that he himſelf, having procurd from a friend(to ſatisſie his Curioſity) a little of the Menſtiuum, (whoſe chiefe Ingredients his friend communicated to him, and he to me,) he did, as he was directed, diſſolve Copper in common Aqua fortis, toreduce it into ſmall parts, and then having kept the Calx of the Powder of this Copper for ſome hours in this Menſtruum, he perceiv'd, that the clear Liquor, which was wealc in Taſt, did not diſſolve the Body of the Metal, but onely extract a blew Tincture, leaving behind a very White Powder, which he quickly reducd by Fuſion into a Metal oſ the ſame Colour, which he found as Malleable as before. Which Ithe leſſe wonder at, becauſe the Experiencd Chymiſt Fohannes Agricola, in his Dutch Annotations upon Pęppius, mentions the makingof a White and Malleable Copper in good quantities upon his own knowledge; and that of ſucha kind of Copper, I have with pleaſure made Tryal, I elſewbere relate. But of theſe matters we may poſſibly ſay more ina convenient place. The Second thing, that ſeems deducible from our former Narrative, is, That however moſt (for I ſay not all) of the Judiciouſeſt among the Chymiſts themſelves, as well as among their Adverſaries, believe Gold too fix'd and permanent àa Body to be changeable by Art, inſomuch that tis a receivd Axiom amongſt many Eminent Spagyriſts, that facilius eſt aurum conſtruere, quà m deſtruere; yet Gold it ſelſ is not abſolutely indeſtructible by Art, ſince Gold being acknowledgſd to be an Homogeneous Metal, a part of it was, by our Experiment, really changd into a Body, that was either true Silver, or at leaſt a new kind of Metal very diſfering from Gold. And ſince tis generally confeſsd, that among all the Bodies we are allowd to obſerve near enough, àand to try our skill upon, there is not any, Whoſe Form is more ſtrictly united to its Matter then that of Gold; and ſince alſo the Operation, by which the White Powder was produc'd, was made onely by a corroſive Liquor, without violence of Fire, it ſeems at leaſt a very probable Inference, That there is not any Body of ſo conſtant and durable a Nature, but that, notwithſtanding its perſiſting inviolated in the midſt of divers ſenſible Diſgniſes, its Texture, and conſequentIy its Nature may be really deſtroyd, in caſe this more powerful and appropriated Agent be brought by a due manner of Application to work upon the Body, whoſe Texture is to be deſtroyd. But this Matter we elſewhere handle, and theretore ſhall now proceed to the Laſt and chief Conſectaries of our Experiment. Thirdly then, it ſeems deducible from what we have deliver'd, that there may be a real Tranſmutation of one Metal into another, even among the perfecteſt and nobleſt Metals, and that eſfected by Factitious Agents in a ſhort time, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, aſtera Mechanical manner. I ſpeak not here of Projection, whereby one part of an Auriſick Powder is ſaid to turn I know not how many 100 or 1000 parts of an ignobler Metal into Silver or Gold, not onely becauſe, though Projection includes Tranſmutation, yet Tranſmutation is not all one with Projection, but far eaſier then it: but chieſly becauſe tis not in this Diſcourſe you are to expect what I can ſay, and do think, concerning what Men call the Philoſophers Stone. To reſtrain my ſelf then to the Experiment we are conſidering, that ſeems to teach us, that, ot leaſt among inanimate Bodies, the nobleſt and conſtanteſt ſort of Forms are but peculiar Contrivances of the Matter, and may, by Agents, that work but Mechanically, that is, by locally moving the parts, and changing their Sizes, Shape, or Texture, be generated and deſtroyd; ſince we ſee, that in the ſame parcel of Metalline Matter, which a littlè before was true and pure Gold, by having ſome few of its parts withdrawn, and the reſt tranſpoſd, or otherwiſe alterd in their ſtructure, (for there appears no token, that the Menſtruum added any thing to the Matter of the producd Silver,) or by both theſe wayes together, the Form of Gold, or that peculiar Modification which made it Yellow, indiſſoluble in Aqua fortis,&c. is aboliſvd, and from the new Texture of the ſame Matter, there ariſes that new Forme, or Convention of Accidents, from which we call a Metal Silver; and ſince Ours was not onely diſſoluble in A4qua fortis, but exhibited that exceſſively bitter Taſt, which is peculiar to Silver, there ſeems no neceſſity to think, that there needs a diſtinct Agent, or a particular Action of a Subſtantial Form, to produce in a Natural ting Properties. For twas but the ſame Menſtruum, devoid of Bitterneſs, that; by deſtroying the Texture of Gold, changd it into another, upon whoſe account it acquir'd at once horth Whiteneſs in colour, Diſſolubleneſſe in 4qua fortis, and aptneſſe to compoſe a bitter Body withit, and I know not how many other new Qualities are attributed. I know tis obvious to object, thattis no very thriſty way of Tranſmutation, inſtead of Exalting Silver to the condition of Gold, to degrade Gold to the condition of Silver. But a Tranſmutation is nevertheleſſe more or leſſe real, for being or not being Lucriferous, and ſince That may inrich a Brain, that may impoveriſh a Purſe, I muſt look upon your humour as. that of an Alchymiſt, rather then ofa Philoſopher, if IT durſt not expect that the Inſtructiveneſs in ſuch an Experiment will ſuſſice to recommend it to You And if I could thors are not miſtaken about what they aſſirm of the Tranſmutation of Iron intoò Copper, though, the Charge and Pains conſider d, it be a matter of no Gain, yet I ſhould have thought it an Experiment of great Worth, as well as the Tranſmutation of Silver into Gold. For tis no ſmall matter to remove the Bounds, that Nature ſeems very induſtriouſly to have ſet to the Alterations of Bodies; eſpecially among thoſe Durable and al. moſt Immortal Kinds, in whoſe Conſtancy to their firſt Forms, Nature ſeems to have deſign'd the ſnewing her ſelf invincible by Art. I ſnould here( Pyrophilus) conclude what I have to ſay of the Experiment, that hath already ſo long entertaind us, by recommending to You the repetition of what I had not the Opportunity to try above once from end to end, were it not, that Iremember ſomething Iſaid about the Menſtruum peracutum, may ſeem to import a Promiſe of communicating to You ſomething of the Efficacy of that Liquor upon Gold. And therefore partly for that reaſon, and partly to make ſure, that the preſent Diſcourſe ſhall. not be uninſtructive to You, I would adde, That though not onely the generality of Refiners and Mineraliſts, but divers of the moſt Judicious Cultivators of Chymiſtry it ſelt, hold Gold to be ſo ſix'd a Boqy, that it can as little be Volatilizd as Deſtroyd, and that upon This ground, that the proceſſes of ſubliming or diſtilling Gold to be met with in divers Chymical Books, are either myſtical, or unpracticable, or fallacious, (in which Opinion I think them not much miſtaen; though This, Iſay, be the perſwaſion even of ſome critical Chymiſis, yet, upon the juſt Expectation Ihad to find my Menſtruum very operative upon Gold, I attempted and found a way to Elevate it to a conſiderable height, but a far leſs. proportion of Additament, then one that were Eiſ li not not fully perſwaded of the poſſibility of Elevating Gold; and though Ihave indeed found, by two or three ſeveral Liquors, (eſpecially the Aqua pugilum, œnigmatically deſcrib/d by Baſilius,) that the Fixedneſs of Gold is not altogether invincible, yet Ifound the Effect of theſe much inferior to that of our Mixture, touching which I ſhall relate to You the eaſieſt and ſhorteſt, though not perhaps the very beſt, manner of imploying it. We take then the fineſt Gold we can procure, and having either Granulated it, or Laminated it, we diſſolve it in a moderate heat, with a ſuſficient quantity of the Menſtruum peracutum, and having carefully decanted the Solution into a conveniently ſiZ'd Retort, we very gently in a Sand- Furnace diſtill off the Menstruum, and if we have a mind to elevate the more Gold, we either pour back upon the remaining ſubſtance ter, rediſſolve it with freſh; the Liquor being abſtracted, we urge the remaining Matter by degrees of Fire, and in no ſtronger a one, then what may eaſily be given ina Sand Furnace, a conſiderable quantity of the Gold will be Elevated to the upper part oſ the Retort, and either fall down in a Golden colour'd Liquor into the Receiver, or, which is more uſual, faſten it ſelf to the Top and Neck in the form of a Yellow or Reddiſh Sublimate, and ſometimes we have had the Neck of the Retort mrichd with good ſtore of large thin Chryſtals, not Yellow but Red, and moſt like Rubies, very glorious to behold; (though even theſe being taken out, and ſuffer'd to lie a due time in the open Aſr would looſe their ſaline Form, and run per Deliquium into a Liquor.) Nor ſee Iany cauſe to doubt, but that by the Reaffuſions of freſh Menſtruum upon the dry Calæ of Gold, that ſtayes behind, the whole Body of the Metal may be eaſily enough made to paſs through the Retort, though, for a certain realon, I forbore to proſecute the Experiment ſo far. But hete (Pyrophilus) I think my ſelf oblig'd to interpoſe a Caution, as well as to give you a further Information about our preſent Experiment. For firſt I muſt tell You, that though even Learned Chymiſts think it a ſufficient proof of a true Tincture, that not onely the colour of the Concrete wiil not be ſeparated by Diſtillation, but the extracting Liquor will paſs over tincted into the Receiver, vet this ſuppoſition, thoughit be not unworthy of able men, may, in ſome caſes, deceive them. And next I muſt tell You, that vhereas I ſcruple not, in leveral Writings of mine, to teach, That the Particles of ſolid and conſiſtent Bodies are not alwaits unfit to help to make up Fiuid ones, ſhall now venture to ſay further, That even a Liquor, made by Diſtillation, be thought, may in part conſiſt of Corpuſcles of the moſt compact and ponderous Bodies in the World. Now to manifeſt Both theſe things, and to ſaew You withall the Truth of what I elſewhere teach, That ſome BOdies are of ſ=o durable a Texture, that their Miunte parts will retain their on Nature, notwiilſtanding variety of Diſguiæes, which may impoſe, not onely upon other men, but upon Chymiſis themſelves; Iwill adde, that to proſecute the Experiment, I droppd into the Yellow Liquor aftorded me by the Elevated Goid, a convenient quantity of clean running Mercury, which was immediately colour'd with a Golden colourd Filme, and ſhaking it to and fro, till the Menſtruum would guild no more, when I ſuppoſd the Gold to be all præcipitated upon the Mercury, Idecanted the clarifi'd Liquor, and mixing the remaining Amalgam (if I may ſo call it) of Gold and Mercury, ith ſeveral times its Weight of Borax, Idid, as I expected, by melting them in a ſmall Cruci. ble, eaſily recover the ſcatter'd Particles oſ the Eſlevated Metal, reducd into one little Maſs or Bead of Corporal or Yellow (though perhaps ſomewhat pal:ſh) Gold. But yet whether the Gold, that tinged the Menſtruum, might not, before the Metal vas reduc'd or præcipitated out of it, have been more ſuccelfully apply d to ſome conſiderable pur. oſes, then a bare Solution of Gold, that hath never been Elevated, may be a Queſtion, which I muſt not in this place determine, and ſome other things that Ihave try'd about our Elevated Gold, I have elſewhere taken notice of; Onely this further Uſe I ſhall here male of this Experiment, that, whereas I ſpeal in other Papers, as if there may be a volatile Gold in ſome Oars, and other Mi. nerals, where the Mine- men do not find any thing of that Metal, I mention ſuch à thing upon the Account of the paſ Experiment and ſome Analogies. And therefore as 7 would not be underſtood to adopt what every Chymical Writer is pleaſd to fancie concerning Volatile Golds ſo I think Judicious men. that are not ſo well acquainted with Chymical Operations, are ſometimes too forward to condemn the Chymiſts Obſervations; not becauſe their Opinions have nothing of Truth, but becàuſe they have had the ill Luck not to be warily enough propoſd. And to give an inſtance in the Opinion, that ſome Minerals have a Volatile Gold, (and the like may be ſaid of Silver,) I think I may give an Account, rational enough, of my admitting ſuch a thing, by explicating it thus: That 4 in our Fxperiment, though after the almoſt total abſtraction of the Menſtruum, the remaining Body being true Gold, and conſequentIy, in its own Nature, ſixd. yetit is ſo ſtrictly aſſociated with ſome volatile ſaline Particles, that theſe, being pre'd by the fire, carry up along with them the Corpuſcles of the Gold, which may Dbe reduc d into a Maſs by the admiſtion of Borax, or ſome other Body fitted to divorce the Corpuſcles of the Metal from thoſe, that would Elevate them, and to unite them into Grains, too big and ponderous to be ſublimd; ſo in ſome Mineral Bodies there may be pretty ſtore of Corpuſcles of Gold, ſo minute, and ſo blended with the unfixd Particles, that they will be carried up together with them by ſo vehement a heat, as is wont to be imployd to bring Ours, and even Metalline maſſes to Fuſion And yet tis not impoſſible, but that theſe Corpuſcles of Gold, that in ordinery Fuſions ſly away, may be de. taind and recoverd by ſome ſuch proper additament, as may either work upon, and ſto uſe a Chymical Term) mortifie the other parts of the Maſs, without doing ſo upon the Gold, or by aſli ſociating with the Volatiſe and ignobler Minerals, ſome way or other diſable them to carry away the Gold with them, as they otherwiſe may do; or by its Fixedneſs and Cognation of Nature make the diſperſd Gold imbody with it. On which Occaſion I remember, that a very Ingenious Man, deſiring my Thoughts upon an Experiment, which he and ſome others, that ere preſent at it, look?d upon as very ſtrange, namely, that ſome good Gold, having, for a certain Tryal, been cuppell'd with a great deal of Lead, inſtead of being udvancd in Colour, as in Goodneſs, was grown manifeſtly paler then before; my Conjecture being, Thut ſo great a Proportion of Lead might contain divers particles of volatile Silver, which, meeting with the fixd Body of the Gold, by incorporating therewith, was detaind, was much confirmd by finding, upon Enquiry, that the Gold, inſtead of looſing its Weight, had it conſiderably inC creaſd; which did much better anſwer my Gheſs, then it did their Expectation, that made the Experiment, and were much ſurpriæd at the Event. But this is no fit place to proſecute the conſideration ofthe Additaments, that may be uſd to unite and fix the Particles of the nobler Metals, blended with volatile Bodies; though perhaps what hath been ſaid may afford ſome Hint about the matter, as well as ſome Apology for the Chymical Term, Volatile Gold: the poſſibiſity of which, I preſume, we have ævincd by the latter part of this Experiment, (in which Iam ſorry I cannot remember the proportion of the remaining Salts, that were able to Elevate the Gold;) for That I have ſeveral times made, and therefore dare much more confidently rely on it, then Ican preſs You to do on the former part, bout the Tranſmutation, or at leaſt Deſtruction of Gold,) till Youor I ſhall have Opportunity to repeat that Tryal. E&Exptriment VIII. T Hough (Pyrophilus; the Experiment; Iam about to ſubjoin, may, at the firſt glance, ſeem onely to concern the production of Taſts, aud be indeed one of the principal, that I deviſd concerning that ſubject, and that belongs to the Notes I have made about thoſe Qualities: yet if You do not ofyour ſelt take notice of it, I may hereafter have Occaſion to ſnew You, that there are ſome particulars in this Experiment, that are applicable to more then Taſts. And ſince I had once thoughts  however ſince diſcouraged by the difficulties of the Attempt) to make my Notes extend even to divers Qualities, which e operations of Chymiſis, and the practice of Phyſicianshave made men take notice of; ( ſuch as the powers- of corro. ding, præcipitating, fixing, purging, bliſtering, ſtupifying, &-) I preſume You will not diſlike, that one, who had thoughts to ſay ſomething even of Chymical and o? Meqical Qualities, ifI may ſo call them, ſhould give You here an Experiment or two about morẽe obvious, though particular, Affections of Bodies, when there are ſeveral things in the Experiment, that may be of a general import to the Doctrine of the Origine ot Qualities and Forms. We took then an Ounce of refined Silver, and having diſſolvd it in 4qua fortis, wee ſuſfer dit to ſoot intoChryſtals, which being dried, we found to exceed the weight oſ the Silver by ſeveral Drachms, which accrued upon the concoagulation of the acid Salts, that had diſlolvd, and were united to the Metal. Theſe C hryſtals we put into a Retort, and diſtill'd them in Sand, with almòtt as great a heat as we could give in 2 hammerd Iron Furnace, wherein the Operation was made; but there came over onely a very litile ſowriſh Flegm with an ill ſent, wherefore the ſame Retort ſt was removd to another Furnace; capable of giving a far higher degree of Heat, namely, that of a nuked fire, and in this Furnace the Diſtillation was purſued by the ſeveral degrees of heat, till at length the Retort came to be red hot, and kept ſo for a good while; but though even by this Operation there was very little driven over, yet That ſufficiently maniſeſted what we aimed at, ſhewing (numely) that a Body extreamly Bitter might afford, as well as it conſiſted of, good ſtore or parts that are not at all bitter, but (which is a very differing taſt) eminently Sowr. For our Receiver being taken off even when it was cold, the containd ſpirit ſmoald out like rectityd a4qua fortis, and not onely ſmelt and taſted like 4qua foriis, to the Annoyance of the Noſe and Tongue, but being pourd upon Filings oſ crude Copper, it fell immediately to corrode them with ding up thick fumes, and in a trice: producd, with the corroded Copper, a ble. iſh colour, Iike That, which that Metal iIs wont to give in good Aqua fortis. Afterwards we took Minium and Aqua fortis, and made a Solution, which being filtred and evaporated, left us a Saccharum S aturni, much like the common made with ſpirit of Vinegar, then taking this ſweet Vitriol of Lead, (as we elſewhere call it) we endeavourd in the formerly mentiond Sand Furnace to drive it over in a Retort; but finding That degree of fire incompetent to force over any thing ſave a little flegmatick Liquor, we cauſd the Retort to be coated, and transferr'd to the other Furnace, where being urg'd with a naked Fire, it afforded at length a ſpirit ſomewhat more copious then the Silver had done. This Spirit ſmoald in the cold Receiver as the other had, and did, like it, rankly ſmell of Aqua fortis, and was neſs of the Concrete that had yielded it, that it was offenſively acid, and being pour'd upon Minium, it did with noiſe and Bubbles fall upon it, and quickly aftorded us a Liquor, which being ſiltred, did, by its Sweetneſs as well as other proofſs, aſſure us, that there would have needed but a gentle Evaporation (i We had leiſure to make it) to obtain from it a true Sugar o Lead; and tis remarkable, that the Concrete, which appear'd White before Diſtillation, remain'd, for the moſt part, behind in the Retort in the form ofa black Caput mortuum, (ſometimes We have had it in a Yellowiſh Lump,) which was neither at all ſweet, as the Vitriol of Lead it ſel? had eminently been, nor at all ſowr, as the Liquor, diſtilll'd fromit, was in a high degree, but ſeemd rather inſipid, and was indeed but a Calæ of Lead, which the heat of the fire had in part reducd into true and manifeſt Lead ny Grains of ſeveral Sizes, that We met with in the Caput mortuum, (the reſt of which is eaſily enough reducible by fuſion with a convenient ſlux into malle⸗able Lead it ſelf.) There are ſome Phænomena of this Experiment, that We may elſewhere have Occaſion to take notice of, as particularly, That, notwithſtanding Silver be a Body ſo fixd in the ſire, that it vill (as tis generally known) endure the Cuppel it ſelf, and though in the dryed Chryſtals of Silver, the Salt, that adheres to the Silver, increaſes the weight of the Metal but about a 40 ora 39purt; yet this ſmall proportion of ſaline Corpuſcles was able to carry up ſo much of that almoſt fixedſt of Bodies, that, more then once, We have had the inſide or the Retort, to a great height, ſo coverd over with the Metalline Corpuſcles, that the Glaſs ſeemd to be Silverd over, and could herdly, by long ſcraping, be freed from the copious and cloſely adhering But the Phenomenon, thatI chieſlydeſire to take notice of at preſent, is this, That not onely Aqua fortis, being concoagulated ith differing Bodies, may produce very differing Concretes, but the ſome numerical Saline Corpuſcles, that, being aſſociated with thoſe of one Metal, had already produc'd a Body eminent in one Taſt, may aſterwards, being fi eed from that Body, compoſe a Liquor eminent for a very diſtering Taſt; and atter That too, being combind with the par. ticles of another Metal, would with them conſtitute a Body of a very eminent Taſt, as oppoſite as any one can be to both the other Taſs; and yet theſe Saline Corpuſcles, if, inſtead of this ſecond Metal, they ſhould be aſiociated with ſuch a one a;s That, they are driven from, would therewith exhibit agen the firſt of the three mentiond Taſts. To prove all this, We took Chryſtals of reſined Silver made with 49ua fortis, and though theſe Chry ſtals be, as We oſten note, ſuperlatively bitter; yet having, by a naked fire, extorted from them what Spirit we could, and found That, as we expected, extremely Acid, we put one part of it upon a few Filings of Silver, of which it readily made a Solution more bitter then Gall, and the other part of the diſtill'd Liquor We poured upon Minium: and though, whilſt it had been an Ingredient of rhe Chryſtals of Silver committed to Diſtillation, it did with that Metal compoſe an exceſſively bitter ſubſtance, yet the ſame Particles, being looſned from that Metal, and aſſociated with thoſe of the Lead, did with them conſtitutea Solution, which by Evaporation afforded us a Saccharum Saturni, or a Vitriol ſweet as Sugar. And for further confirmation, We varied the Experiment, having,. in a naked Fire, diſtilled ſome dry'd Saccharum Saturni made with Aqua fortis, the little Liquor that came over, in proportion to the Body, that aſforded it, was ſo ſtrong a ſpirit of Nitre, that for ſeveral hours the Receiver was ſill'd with red Fumes; and though the ſmoaking Liquor were hugely ſharp, yet part of it, being pour'd upon a piece of its own Caput mortuum, (in vvhich We perceiv'd not any Taſt did at length (for it vvrought but very ſlowly) exhibit ſome little Grains of a Saccharine Vitriol, but the other part, being put upon Filings of Silver, fell upon it immediately vvith noiſe and ſtore of ſmoak, and a vvhile after concoagulated vvith part of it (vvhich it had diſſolv'd) into a Salt exceſſively bitter. Experiment IX. He Artificial Tranſmutation of Bodies, being as the rareſt and difficulteſt Production, ſo one of the nobleſt and uſefulleſt Eſtects of Humane skill and power, not onely the clear InD d ſtances ſtances of it are to be diligently ſought for and priz'd, but even the Probabilities of effecting ſuch an extraordinary Change of Bodies are not to be neglected; eſpecially, if the Verſion, hopd for, be to be made betwixt Bodies of Primordial Textures, (if I may ſo call them,) and ſuch Bodies, as by the greatneſſe of their Bull, and by their being to be found in moſt of the mixd Bodies here below, make a conſiderable part of thoſe, that we Men have the moſt immediately to do with. Invited by theſe conſiderations, Pyrophilus, I ſhall venture to give you the Account oſ ſome Obſervations, and Try:ls, about the Tranſmuting of Water into Earth, thoughiit be not ſo perfect as I Wiſh, and as I Hope, by Gods bleſſing, s male it. TThe fſirſt Occaſion, afforded me to do any thing about this matter, was my being conſulted by a Gentleman, (an antient Chymiſt, but not at all a Philoſpher,) who relating to mẽ how much he had (with the wonted ſucceſs of ſuch Attempts) labourd after the Grand Arcana, complaind to me among other things, that, having Occuſion to imploy great quantity of purifi'd Rain water, he obtaind from it much leſs then he wiſ'd of the ſubſtance that he lookd for, but a great deal of a certain whitiſh excrementitious Matter, which he knew not what to make of. This gnve me the Curioſity firſt to deſire a ſight of it, in caſe he had not thrown it away, (which by good fortune he had not,) and then, taking notice of the unexpected plenty, and ſome of the Qualities of it, to ask him ſome Que ſtions which were requiſite and ſufficient to perſwade me, that this Reſidenee came not from accidental foulneſs of the Water, nor of the Veſſels twas receivd in. This I afterwards often thought of, and indeed it might juſtly enough awaken ſome ſuſpicions, that the little Motes, that have been ſometimes obſervd to appear numerous enough, in pure Rain water whilſt it is diſtilling, might not be meerly accidental, but really produc', as well as exhibited by the action of the Fire. Ithought it then worth while to proſecute this matter à little farthen: And having put a pretty quantity of diſtild Rainwater in a clean Glaſs Body, and fitted it with a Head and a Receiver, I ſufferd it to ſtand in a Digeſtive Furnace, till, by the gentle heat thereof, the Water was totally abſtracted, and the Veſſel left dry: which being taken out of the Sand, Ifound the bottom of the Glaſs all cover'd over withã white (but not ſo very white)ſubſtance; which, being ſcrapd off vvith a Knife, appeard to be a fine Earth, in vvhich I perceiv'd no manifeſt Taſt, and vvhich, in a vvord, by ſeveral Qualities ſeemd to be Earthn. This incourag'd me to rediſtill the Rain-water in the ſame Glaſs Body, vvhoſe Bottom, vvhen the Water vvas all drawn off, aftorded me more of the like Earth: but though the Repetition of the Experiment, and my having, for greater caution, try d ĩt all the while in a new Glaſs, that had not been imployd before to other uſes, confirmd me much in my conjecture, That unleſs it could be prov'd, which I think will ſcarce be pretendeq, that ſo inſipid a Liquor as Rain- woter ſhould, in ſo gentle a heat, diſſolve the moſt cloſe and almoſt Indeſtructible Body oſ Glaſs ĩt ſelf, (which ſuch corroſive Menſtruums as 4qua fortis,and Aqua Regis are wont to leave unharmd,) the Earthy powder, I obtaid from already diſtill'd Rain water, might be a Tranſmutation of ſome parts of the Water into that ſubſtance, yet having unhappily loſt part of my Powder, and conſumd almoſt all the reſt, (for Ikept a little by me, which you may yet ſee,) I ſhould, till T had more frequently reiterated my Experiments, (which then I had not Opportunity to do, though Ihad thoughts of doing ĩt alſo with Snow- water, that I had put into Chymical Glaſſes for that purpoſ, and with liquor of melted Hail, which Ihad likewiſe provided,) and rthereby alſo obtain'd ſome more of this Virgin Earth (as divers Chymiſts would call it) to make farther Tryals with, have retaind greater ſuſpicions, itI had not atterwards accidentally fall'n into diſcourſe of this matter with a learned Phy.ſician, vvho had dealt much in Rainvvater, but he much confirmed me in my conjecture, by aſſuring me, that he had frequently found ſuch a White Earth, as I mention'd, in diſtilld Rain Water, after he had diſtill'd the ſame Numerical Liquor (carefully gatherd at firſt) I know not how many times one after another, adding, that he did not find ſany more then I had done) any caule to ſuſpect, that if he had continud torediſtill the ſame portion of Water, it would have yielded him more Earth. But the Odneſs of the Experiment ſtũll keeping me in ſuſpence, it was not without much delight, that aſterwords mentioning it to a very Ingenious Perſon, whom, ithout his leave, Ithink not fit to name, well verſd in Chymical matters, and whom I ſuſpected to have, in order to ſome Medicines, long wrought upon Rain vvater, he readily gave me ſuch an Account of his proceedings, as Jeemd to leave little ſcruple about the Tranſmutation we have been mentioning: for he ſolemnly affirmd to me, that having obſervò, as I had done, that Rain- vvater would, even aſter a Diſtiilation or two, afford a Terreſtrial ſubſtance, which may ſometimes be ſeen ſwimming up and down in the Limpid Liquor, he had the Curioſity, being ſettled and at leiſure, to try how long he could obtain this ſubſtance from the Water. And accordingly having freed Rain Water, carefully collected, from its accidental and as it vvere fæculent Earthineſs, vhich it vvill depoſite at the firſt ſ=ovv Diſtillation, (and vvhich is oftentimes colourd, vvhereby it may be diſtinguiſ'd from the White Earth made by Tranſmutatiou,) he rediſtill'd it invery clean Glaises, not onely 8 or 10 times, but neer 200, vvithout finding that his Liquor grevv weary of affording him the White Earth, but rather that the Corpuſcles of it did appear far more numerous, or at leaſt more conſpicuous in the latter Diltillation, then in the former. And vvhen I expreſſed my Curioſity to ſee this Earth, he readily ſlevv'd me a pretty quantity of it, and preſented me vvith ſome, vvhich comparing vvith vvhat I hadremaining of mine, I found to be exceeding like it, ſave that it vvas more purely White, as having been, for the main, attorded by Rain Water, that hãd been more frequently rectify?d. And to compare this welcome Powder with That I made my ſelf, I tryd with This divers things, which I had before try⸗ with my own, and ſbecauſe the quantity preſented me was leſs inconſiderable) ſome others too. For Iobſervd in this new Powder, as I had done with my Own, that being put into an excellent Microſcope, and placd where the Sun beams might fall upon it, it appear'd a White Meal, or heap of Corpuſcles ſo exceeding, not to ſay unimaginabiy, ſmall, that, in two or three choice Microſcopes, both Iand others had occaſion to admire it; and their extreme Littleneſs was much more ſenſibly diſcernd, by mingling ſome few Grains of Sand amongſt them, which made a Mixture that lookd like that of Pibble ſtones, and of the fineſt Flower. For our Earth, even in the Microſcope, appeard to conſiſt ofas ſmall Particles, as the fineſt Hair powder to the naked Eye. Nor could We diſcern this Duſt to be tranſparent, though, when the Sun ſcope to have ſome Particles a little gliſtering, which yet, appearing but in ã glaring light, we were not ſure to be no deceptio viſis. 2. l found, that our W hite Powder, being caſt into Water, would indeed for a while diſcolour it by ſomewhat Whitening it, which is no more then Spaud will do, and the fine duſt of white Marble, and other ſtones, whoſe Corpuſcles, by reaſon of their Minuteneſs, ſwimme eaſily for a while in the Water, but when it was once ſetled at the bottom, it continu'd there undiſſolv d(for ought I could perceive) for ſome dayes and nights, as Earth would have done. 3. Having weightd a quantity of it, and put it into a nev clean Crũcible, with another inverted over it for a Cover, I placd it among quick Cosls, and there kept the Cru cible red hot for a pretty while, cauſing the Fire afterward to be acumed with a blaſt of a Bellows, but taking out the Powder, I neither found it melted, nor clotted into lumps, nor, when IWeighrd it again, did I ſee cauſe to conclude that there was much of it waſted, beſides what ſtuck to the ſides of the Crucible, and to a little Clay, vvherewith I had luted on the Cover, and which ſto ſhew you, that the Heat had not been inconſiderable). was in ſeveral places burnt red by the vehemence of the fire; and when Iafterwards kept this Powder in an open Crucible among glowing coals, neither I nor one that I imployd to aſſiſt me, perceiv'd. it all to ſmoak; and having put a little upon a quick Coal, and blown That too, I found that whichI had not blown away, to remain fixd (which ſome Bodies will not do) upon quick Co⸗ls, that will endure the fire in a red hot Crucible. 4. I found this powder to be. much' heavier in ſpecie then VVater. For. imploying a nice pair. of Gold Scales, and a Method that would be too long hęre to. deſcribe, I found that this Powder weigh'd ſomevvhat: though not much) more then twice ſo much common VVater, as vvas equal to it in Bul. And leaſt ſome Corollaries, that ſeem obviouſly containd in the common, but groundleſs, conceipts of the Peripateticks, about the Proportions of the Elements in Denſity &c. ſhould make youexpect, that this povv. der ought to have been much more ponderous, I ſhall adde, that having had the Curioſity, vvhich I wonder no body ſhould have before me, to examine the Gravity of the Earth, which ſeems the moſt Elementary of anv we have, I tool ſome ſifted Wood- aſhes, which I had cauſd to be three or four times boyl'd in a plentiful proportion of Water, to free them from Salt, and hoving put them very dry into common Water, I found them but little heavier then our newly mentiond Powder, ſurpaſſing in weight Water of the ſame Bulk but twice, and a little more thena 6h part, (Water and It being very little more then as I to 2 5.) And that vou may the leſs doubt of this, I will yet ſubjoyn, that, examining the Speciſick Gravity of (white) Glaſs it ſelf, l found that compact Body to be very little, if at all more then 2 times and a halt as heavy as Water of equal Bigneſs to it. So that the Gravity of that Powder, which, borrowing a Chymical term, we have been calling Virgin- Earth, being added to its Tixtneſs, and other Qualities, it may ſeem no great impropriety of Speech to name it Earth, at leaſt, if by Earth we mean not the pure Elementary Earth of the Schools, which many oſ themſelves confeſſe not to be found actually ſeparate, but a Body dry, cold, ponderous, induring the fire, and, which is the main, irreſoluble by Water and Fire into other Bodies ſpeciſically different.  But to return to the Guiſe of the Powder, when I askd this Learned man; whether he obſerv'd the Glaſs he dill ſtilid in to have been fretted by the Liquor, and whether This loſt of its Subſtance, according às it depoſited more Powder, He anſwer'd me, (and he is a Perſon of unſuſpected Credit,) that he found not his Glaſs to have been injur'd by the Liquor, and that the Water waſted (though he were carefull it ſhould not do ſo by Evaporation and Tranſfuſions) by degrees ſo much, that there remain'd, by his æ ſtimate, but about an 8h part of the firſt quantity: and though, for certain reaſons. he kept by him the Liquor laſt diſtill'd, yet he doubted not, but that it might be very nigh totally brought into Earth, ſince out of an Ounce of diſtill'd Rain-water he had already obtain'd near 3 quarters of an Ounce, if not more, of the often mentiond Earth.] Theſe ſeveral Relations will, T ſuppoſe, perſwade You, Pyrophilus, that this Experiment is hopeful enough to be well worth your purſuing, if not that perhãps none but ſuch a ſcrupulous Perſon as I, would think the proſecution of it other then ſuperfluous. And if You do acquieſce in what hath been already done, you will, Ipreſume, think it no mean confirmation of the Corpuſcularian Principles, and Hyporheſes. For if, contrary to the Opinion that is ſo much in requeſt among the generality o? modern Phyſicians and other Learned Men., that the Elements themſelves ore tranſmuted into one another, and thoſe ſimple and Primitive Bodies, which Nature is preſum}d to have intended to be the ſtable and permanent ingredients of the Bodies ſhe compounds herẽ below, may be artificially deſtroyd, and (without the intervention of a Seminal and Plaſtick power) generated or producd: if, Iſay, this may be done, and that by ſuch ſlight means, why may We not think, that the Changes and Metamorphoſes, that happen in orher Bodies, which are acknowledg?d by the MoS derns to be far more lyable to Alterations, may proceed from the Local Motion of the minute or inſenſible parts of Matter, and the Changes of Texture that may be conſequent thereunto Some bold Atomiſts would here be determining, by what particular Wayes this ſtrange Tranſmutation oſ Water into Earth may be pertormd, and would percha nce particularly tell you, how the continually, but ſlowly, agitated parts of the Water, by their innumerable occurſions, may by degrees rub, and us it were grind themſelves into ſuch Surlaces, as either to ſtick very cloſe to one another by immediate contact, (as I elſewhere obſerve poliſ'd pieces of Glaſs to do,) or implicate, and intangle themſelves together ſo, as to make, as it were, little ænots,; which knots(he would add,) or the newly mentiond cluſters of coherent Particles, being then growntoo great and heavy to be ſupported by the Water, muſt ſubſide to the bottom the form of a Powder, which, by reaſoũ of the ſame Gravity of theſe ſoleculæ, and the ſtrict Union oſ the Ieſler particles that compoſe them, obtain an indiſpoſition to diſſolve in water, and to be elevated or diſſipated by the fire; as their Inſipidneſs may be accounted for by its being but the ſame with that of the Liquor, whence they were made, and their Tranſparency by that of the Water they were made of, and by the multitude of the little Surfaces that be]ong to ſo fine a Powder. But though in favour of ſuch conjectures, I could ſomewhat illuſtrate them, partly by applying to this Occaſion what Ielſewhere obſerve of the reducing of the ſluid Body oſ Quickſilver by a bare Circulation, (which is but a repeated Diſtillation) with a proportionable heat, into a real Powder, vvhich alſo vill not ſo eaſily be raiſd by the fire, as the fluid Body, vhence by change of Texture it was made, and partly by ſubjoining, aEe mong other things, how by the conjunction of two diſtill'd Liquors digeſted together, I have obtain'd good ſtore of an inſipid Subſtance, that vould not diſſolve in Water, and that vould long enough indure no inconſiderable degree of Fire; though, I ſay, by theſe and other ſuch'particulars, I could make our Atomiſts conjectures leſſe improbable, vet the full diſquiſition of ſo difficult a Subject is too long and intricate to be proper for this place. æ And thereſore, without here examining our Atomiſts explication of this Metamorphoſis, e will give him leave for a vvhile to ſuppoſe the Tranſmutation it ſelf to be real, and thereupon to conſider, whether the Hiſtorical part ofit do not much disfavour ſome of the chiel Doctrines of the Chymiſts, and a What is here delivered may be, for the main, verify:d by whar the Reader wiil meet with in the (follesing) Xth. Experimenr, though That be not It which the Author meant. fundamental one of Helmonis. For if the pureſt Water may be turn'd into Earth, it will not be eaſie to make it improbable, that the other Ingredients of mixt Bodies, which the Chymiſts call their Hypoſtatical Principles, are capable of being tranſmuted into one another which would overthrow one of thẽ main Foundations oſ their whole Philoſophy; and beſides, if out of the ſimpleſt Water it ſelt, a moderate fire can produce a large proportion of Earth, that was not formally præexiſtent in it, how ſhall We be ſure, that in all the Analyſes, which the Fire makes of mixt Bodies, the Subſtances thereby exhibited are obtaid by Separation onely, without any Tranſmutation? As for Helmont, tis well enough known, that he makes Water to be the Material Principle of all Bodies here below, which he vvould have to be either Wa: ter it ſelf, or but Water diſguid by thoſe Forms , vvhich the "Seeds oſ things have given it. Iuill not here examine, whether this Opinion, if he had reſtrain'd it to Animals and Vegetables, might not, with ſome reſtriction and cxplanations, be kept from appearing abſurd , ſince my Eleutherius hath (thou gh without abſolutely adopting it) elſevvhere pleaded ſor its not being ſo extravagant, as it hath been thought. But whereas Helmont's Grand Argument from Experience is grounded on this, That the Alkaheſt doth, as he affirms, by being digeſted with, and diſtild from other tangible Bodies, reduce them all at laſt into a Liquor, no ay differing from Rain Water, though we ſhould grant the matter of fact, yet the Experiment of our Powder will warrant me to queſtion their Ratiocination. For if all mix'd Bodies be therefore concluded to be materially from Water, becauſe they are, by the Operation of the Fire, and a Menſtruum, atter having paſęd through divers prævious Changes, reduc'd at length into inſipid Water; by the ſame way of arguingſend with greater cogency) I might conclude, that all thoſe Bodies are materially but diſguiſid Earth, ſince without intervention of a Seminal Principle, (for æelmont will not allow that Title to Fire, which he ſtiles the Artificial Death of Things) Water it ſelf may be turnd into Earth. Indeed if that acute Ch, miſt were now alive, and had ſuch an immortal Liquor, as he deſcribes his A lkaheſt to be, I would gladly put him upon trying whether that Menſtruum would reduce our White Earth into Water. But there being no more probability of that, then that ſuch reproduc'd Water. being juſt what it vvas before, might be turn'd into Earth again; it may be probably ſaid, that ſince theſe Bodies are mutually convertible into one another, (and, as to the verſion of Water into Earth, by a ſeemingly ſlight Operation,) they arę not either of them ingenerable and incorruptible Elements, much leſs the ſole matter of all tangible Bodies, but onely two of the Primordial, and of the moſt obvious Schematiſms of that, which is indeed the univerſal Matter, vvhich, as it comes to have its minute Particles aſſociated after this or that manner, may, by ãa change of their Texture and Motion, conſtitute, with the ſame Corpuſcles, ſometimes Water, and ſometimes Earth. But (Pyrophilus) to leave theſe Reflexions. to return to the bold Conjectures that they are grounded on, though if I had Ieiſure and indulgence enough, I could, I confeſs, add many things in favour of ſome of thoſ Thoughts:* yet I would not have you wonder, that, whilſt Ivvas mentioning  Of the poſſible wayes of turning Liquors into canſi ſtent Bodies, by bending, breaking, twiſting, and ly otherwiſe changing the Texture of the Liquor, ſe⸗ more particularly the Hiſtory oſ Fluidity and Fivmneſſe, publiſnd by the Author. the many particulars, that ſeem to evince the change of Water into Earth, I ſhould let fall ſome Words, that intimate a Diffidence about it. For, to diſguize nothing unto You, I muſt confeſs, that having, in ſpight of an unuſual care, unluckily loſt a whole paper of the Powder I had made my ſelf, and having unexpectedly been oblig'd to remove from my Furnaces, before I had mace half the Tryals I judgſd requiſite in ſo nice a caſe, I have not yet laid aſide all my Scruples. For i1. I would gladly know, whether the untranſmuted Rain water, by the depoſition of ſo much Terreſtrial Matter, were grown lighter in ſpecie then before, or ſharp in taſt. Next, I would be throughly ſatisfied, (which I confeſs I am not yet, notwithſtanding all that the followers of angelus Sala have conſidently enough written,) whether and hovv far inſipid Liquors ſas Rain W⸗ter is) may, or may not vvork as Mer. ſtruums upon Stones or Earthy Bodies: not to queſtion, vvhether the Particles of Rain Water may not, by their mutual Attrition, or ſome other action upon one another, be reduc'd into Shapes and Sizes fit to compoſe ſuch a Menſtiuum, as the Liquor was not before; as in divers Plants, that ſeem to be nouriſ'd onely with Water, the Sap is endowd with a ſharp Taſt, and great penetrancy, and activity of parts. 2. It were alſo fit to know, whether the Glaſs Body, wherein all the Diſtillations are made, do looſe ofits VVeight any thing neer ſo much, as the obtained Powder amounts to, over and above the Decrement of VVeight, which may be imputed to the action of the Heat upon the ſubſtance of the Glaſs, in caſe it appear by another Glaſs, ke pt empty inan equal heat, and for the ſame time that the Glaſs looſes by ſuch Operations any thing worth reckoning. And it vvere allo not impertinent to try, whether the Gravity of the obtain'd Powder be the ſame in ſpecie with that of the Glaſs, vvherein the Diſtillations were made: (for that it differa but about a 5 part from the weight of Chryſtalline Glaſs I lately mention'd.) Which Scruple, and ſome of the fotmer, I might have prevented, if Ihad had convenient Metal. line Veſſels, herein to make the Diſtillations inſtead of Glaſs ones. 3. I could wiſh likewiſe that it were more demonſtrably determincd, what is on all hands taken for granted, (as it appears indeed highly probable,) that diſtill'd. Rain Water is a perfectly Homogeneous Body, vvhich if it be not, divers ſuſpicions might be ſuggeſted about its Tranſmutation into Earth, and if it be, twill be as a very ſtrange thing, ſo a matter of very great diſficulty to conceive, hovva perfectly and exquiſitely Homogeneous Matter ſhould, without any Addition, or any Seminal and Plaſtick Principle, be brought to sord great ſtore of a Matter of much more Specifick Gravity then it ſelf, ſince we ſee, that no Aggregate we can male of Bodies but æquiponderant in ſpecie with ater, doth, by vertue of their Convention, grow ſpecifically heavier then it. 4. Having had the Curioſity to try, whether Corroſive Liquors would work upon our white Powder, I found, that not onely good Oyl of Vitriol would corrode it, but ſtrong and deflegmd Spirit of Salt did readily work upon part of it, and that without the aſſiſtance of heat, though not without hiſſing, and exciting great ſtore of bub. bles, as I have known ſuch Menſtruums do, when put upon Lapis Stellaris, or oſifragus, or ſome ſuch ſoft Stone; as it that ſo much defæcated Rain water, actuated by heat, had reſolv'd ſome of the looſer Corpuſcles of the Sand or Stone, that, together with ſome Salts, ſervd in ſome Petrifying VVater, that ſome of the Bodies I took up,and which were preſumd to be petrify'd, were but cruſted over with Stone, that ſeemd generated but by the ſucceſſive appoſition of Stony Particles, that, lying inviſibly mingled with the running VVater, ſtuck in their paſſage to the conveniently diſpoſd Bodies that lay in the Streams way. But yet I muſt not omit, that, when I ſuffer'd this Mixture to ſettle, as much ofthe Powder, as ſeemd to be.a very great part ofit, remaina in the lower part of the Liquor, as if that had rather fretted then diſſolvd it, and that not becauſe the Menſtruum was overcharg d or glutted, as Ifound by put. ting in 2tterwards ſeveral freſh parcels of Powder, which it readily fell upon, not without noiſe and froth Nor muſt ] forget, that ſometimes I have excited ſuch an Ebullition, by powring the ſame Liquors upon the Earthy part of Wood- ahes, ſeveral times waſ'd in boyling water, (though, Iconfeſs, I atterwards ſomewhat ſuſpected there might remain ſome little adhering Aikaly, which might occaſion thoſe Bubbles, notwithſtanding that both I and another, whom Ialſo invited to taſt it, took the Earth to be quite Saltleſſe.) I might (Pyrophilus) adde, that ſometimes alſo me thought I found this Powder (which yet likewiſe ſometimes hapned to me with the lately mentiond Earth of Wood- aſhes) ſomewhat gritty between my Teeth, and ſubjoin divers other particulars, if it were not too tedious to mention to You all the doubts and conſiderations that have occuir'd to me ãbout the recited Change of Water into Earth: which yet are not ſuch as ought to hinder me from giving You the Hiſtorical account I have ſet down, ſince to ſome of my Scruples I could here give plauſible Anſwers, but that I cannot doit in few words. And if any part of our white Powder prove to be true Earth, no body perhaps vet knows to what the Experiment may lead ſagacious Men: and whether in a ſtrict ſenſe it be true Earth or no, yvet the Phænomena, that are exhibited in the production of ir, are ſufficient to give this Experiment a place among the others (ot the ſame Decad) with which tis aſſociated. For ſince out oſ a ſnbſtance that is univerſally acknowledgd to be Elementary and Homogeneous, and which manifeſtly is fluid, tranſporent, much lighter in ſpecie then Earth, moiſt and fugitive, there is artificially generated or obtaind a Subſtance conſiſtent, vvhite, and conſequently opacous, comparatively ponderous, dry; and not at all fugitive; the Alterationis ſo great, and effected in ſo ſimple a way, that it cannot but afford us a conſiderable Inſtance of what the varied Texture of the minute parts may perform ina Matter confeſſedly ſimilar. And if frequently diſtill'd Rain Water ſould not be allowd Homogeneous, our Experiment will at leaſt ſnewus, better then perhaps any hath yet done, how little we are bound to believe what the Chymiſts, and others tell us, when they pretend manifeſtly to exhibit to us Homogeneous Principles, and Elementary Bodies, and how difficult it is to be certain when a Body is abſolutely irreſo]uble into ſpecifically diſfering ſubſtances, and conſequently what is the deteiminate number of the perfectly ſimple Ingredients of Bodies: (ſuppoſing that ſuch there are.) Though I muſt confeſs, that my onely aime is not to Relate what hath been done, but to Procure the proſecution of it. For if the obtaind Subſtance be, by the Rain Water, diſſold out of the Glaſſe, this will both prove a noble and ſurprizing Inſtance of what may be done by inſipid Menſtruums, even upon Bodies that are juſtly reckon'd among the compacteſt and moſt indiſſoluble that we know of, and may afford us many other conſiderable hints, that have been partly intimated already: and if on the other ſide, this Powder, whether it be true Elementary Earth or not, be found to be really produc'd out of the Water it ſelf, it may prove a Magnale in Nature, and of greater conſequence then will be preſently foreſeen, and may make the Alchymiſis hopes of turning other Metals into Gold, appear leſs wild, ſince that by Experimentally evincing, that two ſuch difficult Qualities to be introducd into ⸗ Body, as conſiderable degrees of Fixity & Weight, (hoſe requiſiteneſſe to the making of Gold are two of the Principal things, that have kept me from e⸗ſily expecting to find the Attempts of Alchymiſts ſucceſſeful,) may, without the mixture of a Homogeneous Matter, be generated in it, by varying the Texture of its partss Iwill not now adventure to adde any thing of what I have been attempting about the tranſmuting (without additaments) of pure Alkalizate Salts into Earth, becauſe I do not yet know, whether the Tryals will anſwer my Hopes: (for Ido not yet call them my Expectations.) But upon this ſubject of Tranſmutations, I could, ifit did not properly belong to another Treatiſe, tell you ſomething about the Changes, that may be wrought upon highly rectityd Spirit of Wine, vvhich vvould perchance make You think of other things of the like kind leſſe infeaſible. For vvhereas tis a known thing, that That ſpirituous Liquor being kindled, (and that, if you pleaſe, by other Spirit of Wine actually fird) will, for ought appears, burn all away, that is, be totally turnd into flame; if I durſt rely, in ſo important a caſe; on a couple of Tryals, whilſt I hope for an Opportunity of making farther ones, I would tell You, that by a way unthought on (that 7 know of) by any Body, I have, vvithout any addition, obtaind, from ſuch Spirt of Wine, as, being Iiindleq in a Spoon, would ſ=lame all away, without leaving the leaſt drop behind it, a conſiderable quantity of downright incombuſtible Flegm. And by another way ſmentiond indeed by Helmont, but not taught to almoſt any of his Readers) ſome Ingenious Perſons, that you now and eſteem, vvorking by my directions, (but vvithout knowing vvhat each other vvas doing) did both of them reduce conſiderable quantities of high rectity'd Spirit of Wine (that vvould before have burnt all away) into a Liquor, that was for the moſt part ſlegm, as I vvas informd as well by my own taſt, as by the Tryals I orderd to be made: (being forcd my ſelf to bè moſt commonly abſent.) From which change of the greateſt part of that at firſt liquid Splrit into Flegm, it ſeems deducible, that the ſame portion of Matter, vvhich, by being indled, may be turmd all into Fire, may be, by another vvav of handling, turnd Into Flegm or Water, and this vvithout the addition of any thing, and vvithout being vvrought upon by any Viſible Body, but one ſo extremely dry as duely prepard Salt of Tartar;and that it ſelf is not ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of flegm out of totally inflammable Spirit of Wine, but that, as I was ſaying, I did, by another way, obtain that dull Liquor vvithout imploying the Salt, or any other viſible Body vvhatſoever. But Imale a ſcruple to entertain you any longer witi Extravagances of this Nature, and yet, if I were ſure You vvould contain your ſmiles, I would adde for concluſion, That, if I had had time and Opportunity to ſurniſh my ſelf with any quantity of that Water, Ihad it in my thoughts to try, vvhether that vvould have afforced me ſuch a Terreſtrial ſubſtance, as Rain Water had done, and thereby have undergone a new aud further Metamorphoſis. The X. Experiment. T Here is one Experiment more, two oſ the chief Phænomena of vvhich belong to another Diſcourſe; (vvhere I particularly mention Them,) and yet I ſhall conclude this little Treatiſe vvith the recitation of the Experiment it ſelf, not onely becauſe divers of the Phænomena do eminently belong to our preſent ſubject, but becauſe I have ſcarce met vvith any Experiments more ſuitable to the Deſign I have of ſhevving, before Iconclude this Diſcourſe, vvhat great and ſudden Productions and Deſtructions of Qualities may be effected by the compoſition of the ſmalleſt Number of Ingredients, even among Liquors themiſelves, and ſuch too as are believd to be both of Them ſimple and Homogeneous, and incapable of Putrefaction, that ſo it may appeur, what notable Alterations of Qualities even ſeemingly ſlight and eaſie mixtures can perform among Bodies, both of them ſluid, as well as among thoſe that were either both of them ſtable, or one of them ſtable, and the other conſiſtent. Take then of good Oyl of Virtriol, and of Spirit of Wine, that will burn all away, equal parts, not in quantity, but in Weight; put them together by little and little, and having placd the Mixture in a Bolt-head, or Glaſs Egg with a long neck, and carefully ſtoppd it with a Cork and hard Wax, ſet the Veſſel in a moderate heat to digeſt for a competent while; (two or three weeks may do well,) then pour out the Mixture into a tall Glaſs Cucurbite, to which lute on a Head and a Receiver with extraordinary care, to prevent the Avolation of the Spirits, which will be very ſubtle: then with a very gentle ſire abſtract the ſpirit of Wine, that will firſt aſcend, and when the Drops begin to come over ſowriſh, ſhift the Receiver, and continue the Diſtillation with great care, that the Matter boyl not over, and when you judge that about half the acid Liquor is come over, it will not be amiſs, though it be not neceſſary, to change the Receiver once more; but whether vou do this or no, your Diſtillation muſt be continued, increaſing the fire towards the latter end, till you have brought over all you can, and what remains in the bottom of the Cucurbite muſt be put into a Glaſs well ſtoppd, to keep it from the Ar. NB. I. That to the Production of moſt, if not of all the Phæanomena of this Experiment. it is not abſolutely neceſſary, that ſo long a Digeſtion, (not to ſay, not any, )be premiſd; though if the time above preſcribd be allowd, the Experiment will ſucceed the better. 2. That, I remember, Ihave ſometimes made uſe of Oyl of Sulphur per Campanam (as they call it) inſtead of Oyl of Vitriol, to produce the recited Phænomena; and though the Attempt ſucceeded not ill, as to divers particulars, yet I afterwards choſe rather to imploy oyl of Vitriol, both becauſe it did, in ſome points, better anſwer my Expectation then the other Liquor, and becauſe I would not give occaſion to ſuſpect, that the Odours, hereaſter to be mentiond as Phænomena of our Experiment, were due to the common Sulphur, whence the unctuous Liquor, made per Campanam, was obtain'd, as ſuch, and did no way proceed from the acid Vitriolate Saſt, which that Oyls tis improperly call'd) doth abound with' 3. That I had likewiſe the Curioſity to digeſt Oyl of Vitriol with Spaniſh Wine, inſtead of Spirit of Wine, by which means Iobtain'd an odd Spirit, and reſidence, and ſome other Phæansmena, which I content my ſelf to have in this place given hint of, in regard that Wine being a Liquor of a the Phænomena, afforded me by This, are much fitter for my preſent purpoſe. 4. That great care muſt be had in regulating the fire, when once a good part of the Acid ſpirit, mentiond in the proceſs, is come over. For if the Fire be not increaſd, the reſt will ſcarce aſcend, and if it be increaſd but a little too much, the Matter will be more apt, then one would ſuſpect, to ſwell exceedingly in the Cucurbite, and perhaps run over into the Receiver, and ſpoil what it finds there, as it harth more then once hapned to me, when I was fain to commit the management of the Fire to others. Now the oyl of Vitriol, and the ſpirit of Wine, being both of them diſtill’d Liquors, and the Latter of them ſeveral times rediſtill-d, and one of them being drawn from ſo ſimple and familiar a ſubſtance as Wine, and the other from a Concrete not more compounded, then what Nature her ſelf (which, as Ielſewere ſhew, can, without the help of Art, produce Vitriol) doth divers times preſent us with, theſe Liquors, I ſay, being both or them diſtill'd, and conſequently volatile, one would expect, that by diſtilling them, they ſhould be brought over united, as I have tryed, that the ſpirit of Wine, and oſ Nitre, or alſo of common Salt may be; and as the ſpirits of differing Vegetables are wont to be; or that, at leaſt, the Diſtillation ſhould not much alter them, from what it found them, after they had been well mingled together. But this notwithſtanding, theſe two Liquors being of very odd Textures in reference to each other, their conjunction and diſtillation will make them exhibit divers conſiderable and perhaps ſurprizing Phænomena. For Firſt, whereas ſpirit of Wine hzs no great Sent, nor no good one, and moderately derlegmd Oyl of Vitriol is wont to be inodorous; the Spirit, that firſt comes over from our mixture, hath a Sent not onely very differing from ſpirit of Wine but from all things elſe, that, Iremember, Iever ſmelt. And as this new Odour doth to almoſt all thoſe, whoſe Opinions I have asked about it, ſeem very ſragrant and pleaſant, ſo I have ſometimes had it ſo exceeding ſubtle, that, in ſpight oſ the care that was talcen to lute the Glaſſes exactly together, it would perfume the neighbouring parts of the Laboratory, and would not afterwards bæ kept in by a cloſe Cork, cover'd ith two or three ſeveral Bladders, but ſmell ſtrongly at ſome diſtance ſfrom the Viol wherein it was put, I did not think it unlikely, that ſo noble and piercing a Liqnor might be or no mean efficacy in Payſick; and though I miſ5d of receiving an account ofits Effects f-om ſome ingenious Phyſicians, into whoſe Hunds I put it to hive Tryals made of it, vet I cannot deſpair of finding it a conſiderable Medicine, when I remeniber, partly what hath been done by ſome acquaintances of mine with bare flegme of Vitriol, upon the account ſas is ſuppoſd)of that little Sulphur of Vitriol, that, though but ſparingly, doth inrich that Liquor; and partly, what the Maſters of Chymical Arcana tell us of the wonderful veèrtues of the Volatile Sulphur of Vitriol, and what Ihave obſervd my ſelf, that may invite me to have a good Opinion oſ Remedies of that nature. 2. But to ſevv how much the O. dours of Bodies depend upon their Texture, Iſhall now adde, That after this volatile and odoriferous Spirit is come over, and has been followed by an Acid Spirit, it will uſually, towards the latter end of the Diſtillation, be ſucceeded by a Liquor, that is not onely not fragrant, but ſtinks ſo ſtrongly of Brimſtone, that I have ſometimes known it almoſt tae away the Breath (as they ſpeak) of thoſe, who, when I had the Receiver, newly taten off, in my hand, did (eſther becauſe to make ſport I gave them no vvarning, or becauſe they would not take it, as thinking what I told them impoſſible,) too boldly adventure their Noſes in the Tryal. 3. There is in this Operation produc'd a Liquor, that will not mingle either with the fragrant, or with the fœtid Spirit hitherto deſcrib'd, but is very differing from both ofthem, and is ſo very pleaſant, ſubtle, and Aromatical, that it is no leſs differing as well from Spirit oſ Wine, as Oyl of Vitriol. But of this Liquor Igive a further Account in a more convenient place. 4. When the Diſtillation is carried on tar enough, You will find at the bottom, that the two above mentiond Diaphanous Spirits (for Oylof Vitriol is indeed rather a Saline Spirit, then an Oyl have producd a pretty Quantity ofa Subſtance, not onely very opacous, but black almoſt like Pitch or Jet. 5. And this Subſtance, though prol duc'd by two Bodies, that were not onely fluid, but diſtill’d, will not alone be conſiſtent, but (if the Diſtillation have been urgd far enough) brittle. 6. And though Spirit of Wine be reputed the moſt inflammable, and Oyl oſ Vitriol the moſt corroſive Liquor that is known, yet Icould not find, thet this black Subſtance would eaſily, if at all, be brought, Iſay not to ſlame, but to burn; nor that it had any diſcernible Taſt, though both the Liquors, from whoſe mixture it was obtain’d, have exceeeding ſtrong and pungent Taſls. 7. And whereas both Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Wine will each of them more readily, then moſt Liquors that are yet lnown, mingle with common Water, and diffuſe it Ielf therein, Iobſervd, that this pitchy Maſs, if the Diſtillation had been continued till it vas perfectly dry, would not, thãt I could perceivẽ, diſſolve in common water for member not, for ſome doyes: 8. And Laſtly, whereas the Oylof Vitriol, and the Spirit of Wine, were both of them diſill'd Liquors, and one of them exceeding volatile ond fugitive; yet the black Maſs, producd by them, was ſo far fix'd, that I could not make it riſe by a conſiderably ſtrong and laſting fire, that would have raiſd a much more ſluggiſh Body, then the heavieſt of thoſe that concurrd to produce it. The remaining particulars, that I have obſervd in this Experiment, belong to another Treatiſe, and therefore Iſhall forbear to mention them in this: nor ſhall Iat preſent adde any new Phænomena to thoſe Ihave already recited; thoſe freſhly mention'd Experiments, and thoſe that preceded it, being, even without the aſſiſtance of the four Obſervations Ihave delivered before them, ſufficient to manifeſt the Truth IThave been endeavouring to male out, For in the Experiments we are ſpeaking of, it cannot well be pretended, or at leaſt not well prov'd, that any Subſtantial Forms are the Cauſes of the Eftects I have recited. For in moſt of the (above mentiond) caſes, beſides that, in the Bodies we implòy d, the Seminal Vertues, if they had any before, may be ſuppoſd to have been deſtro; d by the fire, they were ſuch, as thoſe Iargue with would account to be Factitious Bodies, artificially produc'd by Chymical Operations. And tis not more manifeſt, that, in the production oftheſe Efſfects, there intervenes a Local Motion, and change of Texture by theſe Operations, then tis inevident and precarious, that they are the Eftects of ſuch things, as the Schools fancy Subſtantial Forms to be: ſince tis, in theſe new Experiments, by the Addition of ſome new particles Of Matter, or the Receſs, or Expulſion of ſome præexiſtent ones, or, which is the moſt frequent way, by the Tranſpoſition of Minute parts, yet uwithout quite excluding the other two; i that no more skilful a Chymiſt then have been able to produce by Art à not inconſiderable number of ſuch changes of Qualities; that more notable ones are not ordinarily preſented us by Nature, where ſhe is preſumed to work by the help of Subſtantial Forms; I ſee not,  why it may not be thought probable, that the ſame Catholick and fertile Prina ciples, Motion, Bult, S hape, and Texture of the Minute parts oſ Matter, may, under the Guidance of Nature, / l (whoſe Laws the modern Peripateticks uacknowledge to be eſtabliſ'd by the all-wiſe God,) ſuffice likewiſe to produce thoſe other Qualities of Natural Bodies, of which we have not t given par:-
