SYSTEM OF MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY BY JOHN ROBISON, LL. D. LATE PROFPESSOR OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH. WITH NOTES, BY DAVID BREWSTER, LL. D.

The publie already know with how much ability Mr Playſair executed the first part of his task; and it is much to be regretted that he did not complete it, by superintending the publication of the present work. When we consider, however, his advanced age, and the numerous pursuits of his own, which he did not live to finish, we eannot be surprised at his declining to oceupy his time with a species of lIabour hy which he could neither add to his own reputation nor to that of Dr Robison. Under these circumstances, I was requested by Dr Robisons family to superintend the publication of his scientifico works, which consisted of some manuscript articles on Projeetiles and Corpuscular Action,* and of the articles which he had contributed to the fourth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Having enjoyed the advantage of being one of Dr Robison's pupils, I could not decline a task which naturally devolved upon me; nor should I have felt myself at liberty to do 30, had I been able to foresee the difficulties which IT had to encounter in its execution. As the work eould not be extended beyond four volumes, it was necessary to select the most important articles for publication; and even when this selection was made, IT could not confine them within the preseribed Iimits, without a process of abridgment, which was both troublesome and diffieult. In doing this, however, I generally confined myself to the omission of those digressions of a political and religious nature, which, however appropriate they might have been at the time, were, in every respect, unsuitable to scientific discussions; though sometimes, from a diffuseness of style, and a redundancy of illustration, allowable in an Encyclopædia, I was enabled to abridge, without omitting any essential step in the investigationn. The repetitions so unavoidable in articles written and publishett at different times, * The manuscript articles are printed in vol. I. from ꝑ. 159 to 365. I have in some cases omitted; but they still exist to a considerable degree, and, I am persuaded, they wũll not be regarded as defects by the reader who has oceasion to study separately the articles in which they occur. Had the works of Dr Robison been put into my hands in MS. to be published for the first time, I should have felt that the responsibility of the author was transferred to the editor; but, in the present case, almost all the articles had been previously before the publie; and had received from the hands of the author various corrections and additions. Under these circumstances, I was freed from every editorial responsibility, excepting that of the most humble kind. In order to render this work as much as possible a system of meehanieal philosophy, I was anxious that it should contain a complete treatise on astronomy. The short articles on Astronomy, und the artieles on the Tides and the Precession of the Equinoxes, which Dr Robison had written for the Encyclopædia Britannica, were unfit to supply this desideratum. I found it necessary, therefore, to delay the work till the year 1820, when the eopy-right of his System oſ Astronomy had expired. This work has therefore been used as a substitute for the astronomieal articles contained in the Enceyclopædia, and will be found one oſ the most valuable treatises on Physical Astro- nomy that has for a long time been given to the publie. Being desirous of making the work as complete as possible, I had proposed to give an account of the recent discoveries in science in the form of notes. I found, however, as I proceeded, that there was not room for any additional matter, excepting a few notes, and references to more recent works; and I felt that I could make no apology to the reader for inserting compositions of my own, while I was under the necessity of abridging the original work. In the article on the Steam- Engine, however, I deviated from this rule. The great improvements which had been made upon this engine since Dr Robison's article was written, rendered it necessary that considerable additions should be made to it. T had the good fortune to prevail upon our late celebrated countryman, Mr James Watt, to undertake the revision of the article; and though he intended only to correct imperfections, and supply some of the most prominent defſeets, yet he was gradually led to extend his views, and to compose those valuable additions on the History, the Principles, and the Construetion of the Steam- Engine which enrich that part of the work. j To those who may examine Dr Robison's dissertations with a critical eye, it may be necessary to state, that they were all composed under the influence of that cruel disease with which he was aſflieted for a long period of years The knowledge oſ mechanieal philosophy which they everyvhere display possesses the rare quality of being at once practieal and profound, and they are often enriched with original views and ingenious inventions, which it required only the tranquillity of health to perfect and mature. It was his destiny, however, to enjoy but at distant intervals that calm of mind which can alone sustain the ardour of discovery At such periods, his ambition constantly reverted to those original pursuits which he was desirous of bringing to a close; but they were no sooner begun, than they were interrupted by renewed attacks of that painful disease which ultimately deprived him of his lifee Although Dr Robison's name, therefore, cannot be associated with the great discoveries of the century which he adorned, yet the memory of his talents and his virtues will be long cherished by his country. Imbued with the genuine spirit of the philosophy which he taught, he was one of the warmest patrons of genius, wherever it was foundc. His mind was nobly elevated above the mean jealousies of rival ambition, and his love of cience and of justice was too ardent to allow him either to depreciate the labours of others, or to transfer them to himselſ. To these great qualities as a philosopher, Dr Robison added all the more estimable endowments of domestie and of social lifee His friendship was at all times generous and sincere. His piety was ardent and unostentatious. His patriotism was of the most pure and exalted character; and, like the immortal Newton, whose memory he cherished with a peeuliar reverence, he was pre-eminently entitled to the high distinetion of a Christian patriot and philosopher. EDINBURGH, Dec. 22, 182l. DrR BREWSTER rROM MR WATT. DEAR SIE, Ar your request, I have careſully perused my late excellent friend Dr RoBISO'S articles  Steam” and è Steam- Engines,” in the Encyclopædia Britannica, and have made remarks upon them in such places where, either from the want of proper information, or from too great a reliance on the powers oſ his extraordinary memory, at a period when it probably had been weakened by a long state of acute pain, and by the remedies to which hè was obliged to have recourse, he had been led into mistakes in regard to facts, and also in some places where his deduetions have appeared to me to be erroneous. There had been but very little interchange oſ letters between us for some years previous to his wriling those articles, and our opportunities oſ meeting had been rare, and of short duration, and not occupied by philosophical n discussions. Had I been apprised oſ his design, I might at least have prevented the errors respecting the ſacts in which I was concerned; but, upon the whole, it is more surprising to me that his recollection should have served him so well in narrating transactions of 30 years standing, than that it should sometimes have led him astray. If I had not retained some memorandums made at the time of, or soon aſter, their occurrence, I should myself have felt great diſſiculty in recalling to mind the particulars at the period when I first perused those articles, which was some time aſter their publication. I had about that period an opportunity of personally stating to Dr RoBISON s0me remarks upon them, of which he availed himself to a small extent in the Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica, and probably would have done so still more, had he been called upon to remould these articles. I have endeavoured to throw most of my corrections into the form of notes; but in some places I judged it necessary to alter the text; which alterations I have marked to be printed in Italics, that they may be readily distinguished ſrom the original. In a few places I have cancelled part of the text without any substitution, none appearing to me to be required. In others I have leſt part of the reasoning unaltered which I did not concur in; as in mere matters oſ opinion, where no maniſest error was involved, I did not conceive it proper to introduce my own speculations. As the subjects oſ Steam, and Steam- Engines, had been almost dismissed from my mind ſor many years previous to my undertaking this revision, I have called in the aid of my ſriend Mr JonN SourHEERN, and of my son, whose daily avocations in the manuſacture oſ steam-engines, render them more conversant with some points, to direct my attention to them; and of the ſormer, to examine such of the algebraic ſormulæ as appeared essential, an office for 4 vhich he is much better qualified than myselſ; and he hanccordingly marked those formulæ with his initials. I have not attempted to render Dr RoBISON'S memoir a complete history of the Steam- Engine; nor have I even given a detailed account of my own improvements upon it. The ſormer would have been an undertaking beyond my present powers, and the latter must much have exceeded the limits oſ a commentary upon my friends work. I have thereſore conſined myselſ to correcting such parts as appeared necessary, and to adding such matter as he had not an opportunity of knowing. Here it was my intention to have closed this letter; but the representations of friends, hose opinions I highly value, induce me to avail myself of this opportunity of noticing an error into which not only Dr RonisoN, but apparently also Dr BLac, has ſallen, in relation to the origin of my improvements upon the Stenm- Engine, and which not having been publicly controverted hy me, has, I am informed, been adopted by almost every subsequent writer upon the subject of Latent Heat. Dr RoBisoNn, in the article Steam-Engine, aſter passing an encomium upon me, dietated hy the partiality oſ ſriendship, qualifies me as the  pupil and intimate ſriend of Dr BLacx; a description which, not being there accompanied with any inference, did not particularly strike me at the time of its first perusal. He aſterwards, in the dedication to me of his edition of Dr BLACK's Lectures upon Chemistry, goes the length of supposing me to have proſessed to oe my improvements upon the Steam- Engine to the instructions and information I had received from that gentleman, vhich certainly was a misapprehension, as, though I have always ſelt and acknowledged my obligations to him for the information I had received ſrom his conversation, and particularly for the knowledge of ihe doctrine of Latent Heat, I never did, nor could, con- sider my improvements as originating in those communications. He is also mistaken in his assertion, p. 8 of the Preface to the above work, that  I had attended two s courses of the Doctor's Lectures ; for, unſortunately for me, the necessary avocations of my business prevented me ſrom attending his or any other lectures at College; and as Dr RoBISON was himself absent from Scotland for ſour years at the period referred to, he must have been misled by erroneous informationn. In page 184 oſ the Lectures, Dr BLAC says,  I have the pleasure of thinks ing that the knowledge we have acquired concerning è the nature of elastic vapours, in consequence oſ my fors tunate observation of what happens in its ſormation and ss condensation, has contributed in no inconsiderable des gree to the public good, by suggesting to my friend Mr  Warr oſ Birmingham, then of Glasgow, his improves ment on this useſul engine, (meaning the steam-engine, of which he is then speaking). There can be no doubt, from what ſollows in his description oſ the engine, and ſrom the very honourable mention which he has made of me in various parts of his Lectures, that he did not mean to lessen any merit that might attach to me as an inventor; but, on the contrary, he always was disposed to give me fſully as much praise as I deservedl. And were that otherwise doubtſul, it would, I think, be evident ſrom the ſollowing quotation from a letter oſ his to me, dated 13th February, 1783, where, speaking of an intended publication by a friend oſ mine on subjects connected with the history of steam, he says, I think it is very proper for  you to give him a short account of your discoveries and  speculations, and particularly to asert clearly and fully * Repeated more in detail, jwith the same erroneous inſerences, in his note, vol. I. p. 501. s your sole right to the honour of the improvemenis of the  Steam- Engine; and in a written testimonial which he very kindly gave on the occasion of a trial at lav against a piracy oſ my invention in 1796-7, aſter giving a short account of the invention, he adds,  Mr Watt us the sole  inventor of the capital improvement and contrivunce above  mentioned Under this conviction oſ his candour and ſriendship, it is very painſul to me to controvert any assertion or opinion of my revered friend; yet in the present case I find it necessary to say, that he appears to me to have ſallen into an error, and I hope, in addition to my assertion, to make that appęar by the short history I have given oſ my invention in my notes upon Dr RoBISONS essay, as well as by the following account oſ the state of my knowledge previous to my receiving any explanation of the doctrine oſ Latent Heat, and also ſfrom that of the ſacts which principally guided me in the invention. It was known very long before my time, that steam was condensed by coming into contact with cold hodies, and that it communicated heat to them. Witness the common still, &e. &e. It was known by some experiments of Dr CuLLEN, and others, that water and other liquids boiled in vacuo at very low heats; water below 1000. It was known to some philosophers, that the capacity or equilibrium of heat, as we then called it, was much smaller in mercury and tin than in water. It was also known, that evaporation caused the cooling of the evaporating liquid, and bodies in contact with it. I had myself made experiments to determine the ſolloing facts. Ist, The capacities for. heat of iron, copper, and some sorts of wood, comparatively with water. Similar experiments had also subsequently been made by Dr IEVINE, on these and other metals. 2d, The bulk of steam was compared vith that oſ water. 3d, The quantity of water which could be evaporated in a certain boiler by a pound of coals. 4th, The elasticities of steam at various temperatures greater than that of boiling water, and an approximation to the law which it followed at other temperatures. 5th, How much water, in the form of stenm, was required every stroke by a small NEwcoMENS engine, with a wooden cylinder six inches diameter, and twelve inches long in the stroke. 6th, I had measured the quantity of cold water required in every stroke to condense the steam in that cylinder, so as to give it a working power of about 7 IL. on the inch. Here I was at a loss to understand how so much cold water could be heated s6 much by so small a quantity in the form ofſsteam, and applied to Dr BLaCx, as is related in the short history, p. 116, Note, and then first understood what was called Latent Heat. But this theory, though useful in determining the quantity oſ injection necessary where the quantity of water evaporated by the boiler, and used by the cylinder, was known, and in determining, by the quantity and heat of the hot water emitted by NEWCOMENS engines, the quantity of steam required to work them, did not lead to the improvements I aſterwards made in the engine. These improvements proceeded upon the old-established fact, that steam was condensed by the contact of cold bodies, and the later known one, that water boiled in vacuo at heats below 100°, and consequently that a vacuum could not be obtained unless the cylinder and its contents were cooled every stroke to below that heat. These, and the degree of knowledge I possessed of the elasticities of steam at various heats, were the principal things it was necessary for me to consider in contriving the uew engine. They pointed out that, to avoid useless con- ũensation, the vessel in which the steim acted upon the piston ought always to be as hot as the steam itself; that to obtain a proper degree of exhaustion, the steam must be condensed in a separate vessel, which might be cooled to as Iow a degree as was necessary, without affecting the cylinder; and that as the air and condensed water could not be blown out by the steam as in NEwcoMEN'S, they must be extracted by a pump, or some other contrivance; that, in order to prevent the necessity of using water to keep the piston air-tight, and also to prevent the air from cooling the cylinder during the descent of the piston, it was necessary to employ steam to act upon the piston in place of the atmosphere. Lastly, to prevent the cylinder ſrom being cooled by the external air, it was proper to inclose it in a case containing steam, and again ſo inclose that in a case of wood, or of some other substance which transmitted heat slowly. Although Dr Blacks theory of latent heat did not suggest my improvements on the steam-engine, yet the knowledge upon various subjects which he was pleased to communicate to me, and the correct modes of reasoning, and of making experiments of which he set me the example, certainly conduced very much to ſacilitate the progress of my inventions; and I still remember with respect and gratitude the notice he was pleased to take of me when I very little merited it, and which continued throughout his life. To Dr RoBisox Iam also bound to acknowledge my obligations for very much inſormation and oceasional assistance in my pursuits, and above all, for his ſriendship, vhich ended only with his liſe; a ſriendship which induced him, when I was beset with an host oſ foes, to come to London in the depth of winter, and appear as a witness ſor me in a court of justice, whilst labouring under an excessively ainful disorder, which ultimately deprived him of life. To he remembrance of that ſriendship is principally owing my taking upon myself the oſſice of his commentator at my advanced age. May I request, sir, that you and the public will permit that age to be my excuse for any errors I may have committed, and for any deficiencies in the performance of an oſice which at no period would have been congenial to my habits; and allow me to remain, with esteem, DEAR Sin, Your most obedient humble servant, JAMES WATT. HEATHPIELD, Muy 1814. 1. Tuis name marks that department oſ physico-mathematical science which contains the abstract doetrine of MovING PORCES; that is; whatever necessurily results from the relations of our ideas of motion, and oſ the immediate causes of its production and changes. 2. All changes of motion are considered by us as the indications, the characteristies, and the measures oſ changing causes. This is a physical law oſ human thought, and therefore a principle to which we may refer, and from which we must derive all our knowledge oſ those causes. When we appeal to our own thoughts or ſeelings, we do not find in ourselves any disposition to reſer mere existence to any cause, although the beginning of existence certainly produces this reſerence in an instant. Had we always observed ihe universe in motion, it does not appear that we shouid have ascribed it to a cause, till the observation oſ relative rest, or something leading to it, had enabled us to separate, by abstraction, the notion of matter from that oſ motion We might then perceive, that rest is not incompatible with matter; and we might a even ohserve, by means oſ relative motions, that absolute rest might be produced by the concourse of equal and opposite motions. But all this requires reſlection and reasoning; whereas we are now speaking oſ the first suggestions of our minds. 3. We cannot have any notion oſ motion in abstracto, without considering it as a state or condition of existence, which would remain, iſ not changed by some cause. It is ſrom changes alone, therefore, that we inſer any agency in nature; and it is in these that we are to find all that we know oſ their causes. 4. When we look around us, we cannot but observe, that the motions oſ bodies have, in most cases, if not always, some relation to the situation, the distance, and the diseriminating qualities of other bodiess. The motions of the moon have a palpable relation to the earth; the motions of the tides have as evident a relation to the moon; ithe motions oſ a piece oſ iron have a palpable dependence on a magnet. The vicinity oſ the one seems to be the weeasion, at least, of the motions of the other. The cnuses oſ these motions have an evident connection with or dependence on the other hody. We are even disposeũ ſo imagine, thut they are inherent in that body, and that it Possesses eertain qualities which are the cuuses oſ those moulifications f motion in other bodies. These serve to disTinguish some bodies from others, and may therefore he alled rmmoPPRTæES; Endũ, 5iNCc the condition of other bodies vo evidently depends on them, these properties express very interesting rẽlations of hodies, and are chieſly attended to in the enumeration oſ the circumstances which msvertain what we osll the nuture oſ amy thingg We do mot.mean to say, that these inferences are always just; may, we know that many o them ure ill-founded: but they are resl, and they serve abunduntly for inſorming us what we may expect frem any proposeũ situation oſ things. Tt is enough for us to know, that when a piece oſ iron ĩs 30 and s0 situated in relation to a magnet, it will move in a certain manner. This mutual relation oſ hodies is difſerently considered, according to the interest that we chance to take in the phenomenon. The eause oſ the approach oſ the iron to a magnet is generally ascribed to the magnet, whieh is said b attract the iron, hecause ve ecommonly employ the magnet in order that these motions may take place The similar approach of a stone o the earth is ascribed io the stone, and we say that it tends to the earth In all probability, the procædure oſ nature is the same in hoth; for they are observed, in every instanee, to be mutual bet ween the related bodiæes As iron approaches a magnet, s0 the magnet approaches the iron. The same thing is observed in the motions of ælectrified hodies; also in the case oſ the stone and the æarth. Thereſore the cause oſ the motions may be eonceived as inherent in either, or in both. The qualities thus inherent in hodies, constituting their mechanical relætions, have heen called the MuCHANICAL APrECTIONS OF MATTER. But they are more commonly namæd ProwERE O PORCES; and the event which indicates their presence, is considered as the eſſeet and mark oſ their ageney. The magnet is id to er on the iron, the eorth is said to acr on the stone; and the iron and the stone are smid to acæ on the magnet and on the earth. All this is figurative or metaphorieal language. All languages have bægun with social union, and have improved along with iĩt. The fſirst eolleetions of words expressed the most ſamiliar and the most interesting notions. In the process of social improvement, the number oſ words did not inerease in the same proportion with the notions ihat beca me interesting and ſamiliar in their turn: ſor it oſien happened that relations oſ certain ideas so much resembled the relations oſ certain other ideas, that the word æpressing one oſ them served very well ſor expressing the other; because the disimilar eircumstances oſ the two cases prevented all chance oſ mistakee Thus we are said to surmount a diſficulty, without attaching to the word the notion of getting over a steep hil. Languages are thus filled with figurative expressions. 5. PowER, FOorcE, and AcrioN, are words which must have appeared in the language oſ the most simple people; because the notions oſ personal ahility, strength, and exertion, are at once the most familiar and the most interesling that can have a place in the human mind. These terms, when used in their pure, primitive sense, express the notions oſ the power, ſorce, and action of a sentient, active, being. Such a being only is an agent. The exertion oſ his power or force is (exclusively) action: But the relation of cause and effect so much resembles in its results the relation between this force and the work performed, that the same term may be very intelligibly employed for both. Perhaps the only case of pure unfigurative action is that oſ the mind on the body. But as this is always with the design oſ producing some change on external bodies, ve think only oſ them; the instrument or tool is overlooked, and we say that we act on the external body. Our real action, therefore, is but the first movement in a long train of successive events, and is but the remote cause oſ the interesting event. The resemblance to such actions is very strong indeed in many cases oſ mechanical phenomena. A man throws a ball by the motion of his arm. A spring impels a hall in the same manner by unbending. These two events resemble each other in every circumstance but the action of the mind on the corporeal organthe rest oſ it is a train oſ pure mechanism. In general, because the ultimate results oſ the mutual inſluence oſ budies on each other greatly resemble the ultimate results of our actions on bodies, wve have not invented appropriated terms, but have contented ourselves with those already employed for expressing our own aclions, the exertions oſ our own powers or ſorces. The relation of physical cause and eſſect is expressed metaphorieally in the words which belong properly to the relation oſ agent and action. This has been attended by the usual consequences of poverty of language, namely, ambiguity, and sometimes mistake, both in our reſlections (hich are generally carried on by mental discourse), our reasonings, and our conclusions. It is necessary to be on our guard against such mistakes; for they frequently amount to the conſounding of things totally different. Many philosophers oſ great reputation, on no better ſoundation than this metaphorical language, have conſounded the relations oſ activity and of causation, and even denied that there is any difference; and they have aſſirmed, that there is the same invariable relation between the determinations of the will and the inducements that prompt them, as there is between any physical power and its effect. Others have maintained, that the first mover in the mechanical operations, and indeed through the whole train oſ any complicated event, is a percipient and intending principle in the same manner as in our actions. According to these philosophers, a particle of gravitating matter perceives its relation to every other particle in the universe, and determines its own motion aceording to fixed laws, in exact conſormity to its situationn. But the language, and even the actions of all men, shew that they have a notion oſ the relation oſ an agent to the action, ensily distinguishable (because all distinguish it) ſrom the relation between the physical cause and its efſect. 6. When we speak oſ powers or ſorces as residing in a body, and the effect as produced by their exertion, the body, considered as possessing the power, is said Lo acr on the other. A magnet is said to act on a piece oſ iron; i hilliard ball in motion is said to act on one that is hit by : but if we attempt to ſix our attention on this action, distinet both from the agent and the thing acted on, we i no objeet of contemplationthe exertion or procedure oſ nature in producing the eſfect does not eome under our viem. When we speak oſ the action as distinet from the agent, we find that it is not the action, properly speaking, but the act, that we speak oſ. In like manner, the action oſ a mechanical power ean be conceived only in the eſfect produced. ] T. A man is not said to act unless he produces some eſſfect. Thought is the act of the thinking principle; mbttion oſ the limb is the act of the mind on it. In mechanics, also, there is action only in so far as there is mechanical effect produced. I must act violently in order to begin motion on a slide: I must exert foree, and this ſorce exerted produces motion. I conceive the produetion of motion, in all cases, as the exertion of force; but it requires no exertion to continue the motion along the slide; I am conscious oſ none, thereſore I ought to inſer that no force is necessary ſor the continuation of any motion. The continuation oſ motion is not the production of any new efſect, but the permanency oſ an effect already produced. We indeed consider motion as the effect oſ an action; but there would he no effect iſ the body were not moving. Motion is not the action, hut the efſect oſ the action. 8. Mechanical actions have been usually classed under two heads: they are either PRES:URES Or INPULSIONS. They are generally considered as oſ different kinds: the exertions of different powers. PuEssuRE is supposed to diſſer essentially ſrom InruLSE. Instead oſ attempting to define, or describe, these two kinds of ſorces and actions, we shall just mention some instances. This will give us all the knowledge oſ their distinctions that we can acquire. Whahen a ball lies on a table, and I press it gently on one side, it moves toward the other side of the table I I follow it with my finger, continuing my pressure, it accelerates continually in its motion. In like mauner, when I press on the handle of a common kitchen juck, the ſly begins to move. Iſ I contiuue to urge or press round the handle, the ſly aceslerates continnally, and may be brought into a state oſ very rapid motionn These motions are the eſſects oſ genuine pressure The hall would be urged along the table in the suame manner, and with a motion continually accelerated, hy the unbending oſ a spring Also, a spring coiled up round the axis oſ the handle oſ the jack would, hy uncoiling itself, urge round the ſy with a motion accelerating in the same way. The more I reſlect on the pressure oſ my finger on the hall, and compare it with the eſſeet oſ the spring on it, the more clearly do I see the perfect similarity: and I call thes inſluences, exertions, or actions, by one name, PnæssurE, taken ſrom the most ſamiliar instance oſ them Again, the very same motion may be produced in the ball or ſly, by pulling the hall or the machine hy means of a treaid, to whieh a weight is suspendedc As hoth are motions accelerated in the same manuer, I call the inſluence or action of the thread on the hall or machine by the same name Purssunn, and WEiòu? is considered as a pressing power. Indeed, I ſeel the same compression ſrom the real pressure oſf a man on my shoulders, thot I would ſeel ſrom a load loid on them But the weight in our example is acting by the intervention oſ the threadl. By is pressure, it is pulling at that part oſ the thread to which ĩt is fastened; this purt is pulling at the next by meons of the force oſ cohesion; and this pulls at a third, and so on, till the most remote pulls at the ball or the machine Thus may elasticity, weight, cohesion, and other forces, perſorm the oſfice oſ a genuine power; and since thæir result js always a motion heginning ſrom nothing, and aecelerating by pereeptible degrees to any velocity, this resemblance makes us call them by one ſumiliar name. But ſarther, Isee that iſ the thread be cut, the weight will ſall with an accelerated motion, which will increase Lo any degree, if the length of the ſall be great enough. I aseribe this also to a pressing power acting on the weight. Nay, aſter a very little refinement, I consider this power as the cause of the body's weight; which word is but a distinguishing name for this particular instance oſ pressing power. Gravitation is therefore added to the list of pressures; and, for similar reasons, the attractions and repulsions of magnets or electric bodies may be added to the list; for they produce actual compressions of hodies placed between them, and they produce motions gradually accelerated, precisely as gravitation doess. Therefore all these powers may be distinguished by this descriptive name pressures, which, in strict language, belongs to one of them only. Several writers, however, subdivide this great class into pressions and solicitations. Gravity is a solicitation ab extra, by which a body is urged downward. In like manner, the forces of magnetism and electricity, and a vast variety of other attractions and repulsions, are called solicitationss. We see little use for this distinetion, and the term is too like an aſſection of mind. 9. InruLsiON is exhibited when a ball in motion puts another ball into motion by hitting, or (to speak metaphorically) by striking itt. The appearances here are very diſferent. The body that is struck acquires, in the instant of impulse, a sensible quantity of motion, and sometimes a very rapid motionn. This motion is neither accelerated nor retarded aſter the stroke, unless it be afſected by some other ſorce. It is also remarked, that the rapidity oſ the motion depends, inter alia, on the previous velocity oſ the striking body For instanee, iſ a clay ball, moving with any velocity, strike another equal ball which is at rest, the struck ball moves with halſ the velocity of the other. And it is farther remarkable, that the striking body always loses as much motion as the struck body gains. This universal and remarkable fact seems to have given rise to a conſused or indistinet notion oſ a sort oſ transſerence oſ motion ſrom one body to anotherr. The phraseology ir general use on this subject expresses this in the most precise terms. The one ball is not said to cause or produce motion in the other, but to communicate motion to it; and the whole phenomenon is called the communication of motionn We call this an indistinct notion; for surely no one will say that he has a clear conception of it. We can form the most distinet notion oſ the communication oſ heat, or of the cause of heat; of the communication oſ saltness, sweetness, and a thousand other hings; but we cannot conceive how part of, that identical motion which was formerly in A, is now infused into B, being given up hy A. It is in our attempt to ſorm this notion that we find that motion is not a thing, not a substance which can exist independently, and is susceptible oſ actual transſerence It appears in this case to be a state, or condition, or mode oſ existence, oſ which bodies are susceptible, which is producible, or (to speak without metaphor) causable, in bodies, and which is the efſect and charaeteristic of certain natural qualities, properties, or powers. We are anxious 1o have our readers impressed with clear and preeise notions on this subject, heing confident that such, and only such, will carry them through some intrieate paths oſ mechanical and philosophieal research. 10. The remarkable circumstance in this phenomenon is, that a rapid motion, which requires for the eſfecting it the action oſ a pressing power, continued ſor a sensible, and ſrequently a long time, seems to be efſected in an instant by impulsion. This has tended much to support the notion oſ the actual transſerence of something formerly possessed exclusively by the striking body, inhering in it, but separable, and now transſused, into the hody stricken. And now room is ſound for the employment oſ metaphor, both in thought and language. The striking body aſſeets the hody which it thus impels: It therefore possesses the power oſ impulsion, that is, oſ communicating motion. It nossesses it only uhile it is in motionn. This power, there- fore, is the eſficient distinguishing cause of its motion and its only office must he the eontinuation of this motion. It is therefore called the iuEREN? FORCE, the ſorce inherent in a moving body, vis insr?a corpori moto. This foree is transſused into the body impelled; and thereſore the transſerenee is instantaneous, and the impelled hody continues its motion till it is changed by some other action. All this is at ſirst sight very plausible; but a scrupulous attention to those ſeelings which have given rise to this metaphorieal eonception, should have produced very diſferent notions. I am conscious oſ exertion in order to begin motion on a slide; but iſ the ice be very smooth, I am conscious oſ no exertion in order to slide along. My power is felt only while I am conscious oſ exerting it: Thereſore I have no primitive ſeeling or notion of power while I am sliding along. I am certain that no exertion of power is necessary heree Nay, I find that T cannot think of my moving forward without efſort otherwise than as a certain mode oſ my existencee Yet we imagine that the partisans oſ this opinion did really deduce it in some shape from their feelings. We must continue the exertion of walking in order to walk on; our power oſ walking must be continually exerted, otherwise we shall stop. But this is a very imperſect, incomplete, and careless observationn. Walking is much more than mere continuance in progressive motion. It is a continually repeated liſting our hody up a small height, and allowing it to come down agnin. This renewed ascent requires repeated exertion. lIl. We have other ohservations oſ importance yet to make on this ſorce of moving bodies, but this is not the most proper oceasion. Meanwhile we must remark, that the instantaneous production of rapid motion by impulse has induced the first mechanicians of Europe to maintain, that the power or foree of impulse is unsuseeptible oſ any comparison with a pressing power. They have asserted, that impulse is inſinitely great when compared with pres- mre; not recolleeting that they held them to be things totally disparate, that have no proportion more than weight and sweetness But these gentlemen are perpetually enticed away ſrom their ereed hy the similarity oſ the ultimate results oſ pressure and impulse No person can find any difſerence between the motion of two halls moving equally swiſt, in the same direction, one oſf which is descending by gravity, and the other has derived its molion ſfrom a blow. This struggie of the mind to maintain ils ſaith, and yet accommodate its doctrines to what we see, has oceasioned some other eurious forms of expression. Pressure is considered as an effort to produce motion. When a ball lies on a table, its weight, which they eall a pouer, continually and repeatedly endeavours (mark the metaphorical word and thought) to move the hall downward. But these efſorts are inefſectua. They say that this ineffectual power is deud, and eall it a vis nonTUA: hut the ſorce oſ impulsion is called a vis viva, a living ſorce. But this is very whimsical and very inaccurate. If the impelling hall ſalls perpendicularly on the other lying on the table, it will produee no motion any more than gravity will; and if the table be annihilated, gravity becomes a vis otuva. We must now add, that, in order to prove that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure, these mechanicians turn our attention to many ſumiliar ſacts which plead strongly in their favour. A carpenter will drive a nail into a board with a very moderate blow oſ his hammer. This will require a pressure which seems many hundred times greater than the impelling efſort of the carpenter. A very moderate blow will shiver into pieces a diamoni which would carry the weight oſ a mountain. Seeing this prodigious superiority in the impulse, how shall they account for the produetion oſ motion by means oſ pressure? for this motion of the hammer might have heen acquired by its ſalling ſrom a height; nay, it is actually acquired by means of the continued pressure oſ the carpenter's arm. They consider it as the aggregate oſ an infinity oſ succeeding pressures in every instant oſ its continuance, so that the insigniſicant smallness oſ each eſſort is compensated by their inconceivable number. On the whole, we do not think that there is clear evidence that there are two kinds oſ mechanical force essentially difſerent in their nature. It is virtually given up by those who say that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure. Nor is there any considerable advantage to be obtained by arranging the phenomenon under those two heads We may perhaps find some method oſ explaining satisſactorily the remarkable difſerence that is really observed in the two modes oſ producing motion; namely, the gradual production oſ motion by acknow ledged pressure, and the instantaneous production of it by impulse. Indeed, we should not have taken up so much of our readers attention with this subject, had it not been ſor some inſerences that have been made ſfrom these premises, which meet us in our very entry on the consideration of first principles, and that are of extensive inſluence on the whole science oſ mechanical philosophy, and, indeed, on the whole study oſ nature. 12. Mechanicians are greatly divided in their opinion about the nature of the sole moving force in nature. Those whom we are now speaking of, seem to think that all motion is produced by pressure: For when they consider impulse as equivalent to the aggregate oſ an infinity of repeated pressures, they undoubtedly suppose any pressure however insigniſicant, as a moving ſorcee. But there is a, party, both numerous and respeetable, who maintain that mulipsion is the sole cause of motion. We see bodies in motion, say they, and we see them impel others; and we see that this produetion oſ motion is regulated by such laws, that there is but one absolute quantity oſ motion in the universe which remains unalterably the same. It must hereſore be transſused in the acts of collisionn. We also me, with clear evidence, in some cases, that motion ean produce pressure Euler adduces some very whimsical and complicated cases, in which an action, precisely similar to pressure, may be produced hy motion. Thus, two balls connected by a thread, may he so struck that they shall move ſorward, and at the snme time wheel round. In this case the connecting thread will be stretched between them Now, say the philosophers, since we see motion, and see that pressure may be produced by motion, it is preposterous to imagine that it is any thing else than a result oſ certain motions; and it is the business oſ a philosopher to inquire and discover what motions produce the pressures that we ohserve. They then proceed to account ſor those pressing powers, or solicitations to motion, which we observe in the acceleration of ſalling bodies, the attractions of magnetism and electricity, and many other phenomena oſ this kind, where bodies are put in motion by the vicinity oſ other bodies, or (in the popular language) by the action oſ other bodies at a distance To say that a magnet can act on a piece oſ remote iron, is to say that it can act where iĩt is not; which is as absurd as to say, that it can act when it is not. Nihil movelur, says Euler, nisi a contiguo et molo. The bulk oſ these philosophers are not very anxicus sbout the way in which these motions are produced, nor do they ſall upon such ingenious methods oſ producing pressure as the one already mentioned, which was adduced by Euler. The piece oſ iron, say they, is put in motion when brought into the neighbourhood of a magnet, because there is a stream oſ ſluid issuing from one pole of the magnet, which circles round the magnet, and enters at the other pole: This stream impels the iron, and arranges it in certain determined positions, just as a stream oſ water would arrange the ſlote grass. In the same manner, there is a stream ofſ ſluid continually moving towards the centre oſ the earth, which impels all bodies in lines perpendieular to the surſace; and s0 on with regard to other like phenomena. These motions are thus reduced to very simple cases by impulsion. It is unnecessary to reſute this doctrine at present; it is enough that it is oontrary to all ſhe dietates oſ common sense, to sppose an agent that we do not see, and ſor whose existence we have not the smallest argument; with equal propriety ve might suppose ministering spirits, or mny thing that we please. 13. Other philosophers are s0 dissatisſied with this notion oſ the production of pressure, that they, on the other hand, aſſirm that pressure is the only moving force in nature; not according to the popular notion oſ pressure, by the mutual contact of solid bodies, but that kind of pressure which has bęen called solicitation; such as the power of gravity. They affirm, that there is no such thing as contact on instantaneous communication of motion by real collision. They say (and they prove it by very convinoing facts) that the particles of solid bodies exert very strong repulsions to a small distance; and thereſore, vhen they are brought by motion suſſiciently near o another body, they repel it, and are equally repelled by it. Thus is motion produced in the other body, and their own motion is diminished. And they then shew, by a scrupulous consideration of the state oſ the bodies while the one is advancing and the other retiring, in what manner the two bodies attain a common velocity, so that the quantity oſ motion beſore collision remains unehanged, the one body gaining as much as the other losess They also shew cases oſ such mutual action bet ween bodies, where it ĩs evident that they have never come into contact; and yet the result has been precisely similar to those cases where the motion appeared to be changed n an instant. Thereſore they conclude, that there is no such thing as nstantaneous communication, or transſusion oſ motion, by con- laet in eolſision or impulse. The reason why previous motion oſ the impelling body is necessary, is not that it may have a vis insita corpori mlo, a ſorce inherent in it by its being in motion, but that it may continue to ſollow the mpẽlled and retiring body, and exert on it a force inherent in ĩtæelſ, whether in motion or at restAccording to these philosophers, thereſore, all moving ſorees are oſ that hind which has been named solicitation; such as gruvity. We shall know it afterwards by the more ſamiliar and descriptive name of AcoELE=RATNG or RETAnDING foree. 14. The exertions oſf mechunical forces are differently termed, acoording to the reſerence thut we make to the result. IA, in boxing or wrestling, I strike, or endeavour 10 throw my antagonist, I am suid to acr; but if I only parry his blows, or prevent him ſfrom throwing me, I am saũ 10 nEs IS®. This distinction is applied to the exertions oſ mechanioal powerss When one hody A changes the motion of another B, ve may consider the change n the motion of B either as the indieation and mehsure oſ A power oſ producing motion, or as the ndication and measure oſf A's resistance to the being brought to rest, or having its motion any how changed. The distinction is not in the thing itslſ, but only in the reference that we are disposed, by other oonsiderations, to make oſ its æffect. They may be distinguished in the following manner: Iſa hange of motion ſollow when one oſ the powers censes to be exerted, that power is conceived as having resisted. The whole language on this subject is metaphorieal. Resistance, effort, endeavour, &e. are words which eamot he employed in mechunioal discussions without figure, hecause they all express notions which relate to sentient beings; an the unguarded indulgence oſ this ſigurative language hnas so much affected the imagination oſ philosophers, that muny have almost animated all matter. Perhaps the word REeacrion, imtroduced (we think) by Newton, is the best term ſor expressing that mutual ſorce which is perceived in all the operations oſ nature that we have investigated with success. As the magnet attraets iron, and in s0 doing is said to act on it; so the iron attracts the magnet, and may be said to reoct on it I5. With respect to the difficulty that has been objected to the opinion oſ those who maintain that all the mechanical phenomena are produced by the agency oſ attracting or repelling ſorces; namely, that this supposes the bodies to aet on each other at a distance, however small those distances may be, which is thought to be absurd, it may be observed, that we may ascribe the mutual approaches or recesses to tendeneies to or ſrom each other. Whahat we call the attraction of the magnet may be considered as a tendency oſ the iron to the magnet, somewhat similar to the gravitation oſ a stone toward the earth. We surely (at least the unlearned) can and do conceive the iron to be aſfeeted hy the magnet, without thinking oſ any intermedium. The thing is not thereſore inconceivable; which ĩs all that ve know about absurdity: and we do not know uny thing about the nature or essenee oſ matter which renders this tendency to the magnet impossible That we do not see intuitively any reason why the iron should approach the magnet, must be granted; but this is not enough to entitle us to say, that sueh a thing is impossible or inconsistent with the nature oſ matter. It appears, thereſore, to he very hasty and unwarrantable, to suppose the impulse oſ an invisible ſluid, of which we know nothing, and oſ the existence of which we have no prooſ. Nay, iſ it be true that bodies do not come into contact, even when one ball hits another; and drives it before it, this invisible ſluid will not solve the difſiculty; because the same diſficulty oceurs in the action oſ any particle oſ the ſluid on the hody. We are obliged to say, that the production oſ motion without any observed contact, is a much more familiar phenomenon than the produetion of motion by impulsion. More motion has been produced in his way by the gravitation of a small strenm oſ water, ruming ever since the creation, than by all the impulses in the world twice toldl. We do not mean by this to say, that the giving to this observed mutual relation between iron and a loadstone the name tendency makes it less ahsurd, than when we say that the londstone attraets the iron; it only makes it more conceivable: It suggests a very ſumiliar analogy: but both are equally ſigurative expressions; at least as the word tendency is used at present. In the language of ancient Rome, there was no metaphor when Virgil's hero said, Tendimus in Latium. Tendere versus solem means, in plain Latin, to approach the sun. The safe way oſ eonceiving the whole is to say, that the condition of the iron depends on the vicinity oſ the magnet. 16. When the exertions oſ a mechanical power are ohserved to be always directed toward a hody, that body is said to attract; but when the other body always moves off from it, it is sald to repel. These also are metaphorieal expressions. I attract a boat when I pull it toward me by a rope; this is purely Arraacrion; and it is pure, unfigurative ReruLsioN, when I push any body from me. The same words are applied to the mechanical phenomena, merely because they resemble the results of real attraction or repulsion. We must be much on our guard to avoid metaphor in our conceptions, ànd never allow those words to suggest to our mind any opinion about the manner in which the mechanical ſorces produce their efſects. It is plain, that iſ the opinion of those who maintain the existence and action oſ the above mentioned invisible ſluid be just, there is nothing like attraction or repulsion in the universee We must always recur to the simple phenomenon, the motion to or ſrom the attracting or repelling body; ſor this i; all we see, and generally all that we know. 17. We conceive one man to have twice the strength oſ vOL. I. n another man, when we see that he can withstand the united efſort of two otherss Thus animal force is conceived as a quantity, made up of, and measured by, its own parts. But we doubt exceedingly whether this be an accurate conceptionn. We have not a distinet notion oſ one strain added to another; though we have oſ their being joined or combinedc. We want words to express the difference oſ these two notions in our own minds; but we imagine that others perceive the same differencee We conceive clearly the addition of two lines or of two minutes; we can conceive them apart, and perceive their boundaries, common to both, where one ends and the other hegins. We cannot conceive thus of two forces combined: yet we cannot say, that two equal forces are not double oſ one of them. We measure them by the effects which they are Enown to produce. Yet there are not wanting many cases where the action of two men, equally strong, does not produce a double motion. In like manner, we conceive all mechanical forees as measurable by their efſects; and thus they are made the subjects oſ mathematical discussion. We talk oſ the proportions oſ gravity, magnetism, electricity, &e.; nay, we talk of the proportion oſ gravity to magnetism:VYet these, considered in themselves, are disparate, and do not admit oſ any proportion; but they produce efſects, some oſ which are measurable, and whose assumed measures are susceptible oſ comparison, being quantities oſ the same kind. Thus, one of the efſects of gravity is the acceleration oſ motion in a ſalling body; magnetism will also accelerate the motion of a piece of iron; these two accelerations are comparablee But we cannot compare magnetism with heat; because we do not know any measurable eſſeets oſ magnetism that are oſ the same kind with any eſſects of heat. When we say, that the gravitation oſ the moon is the 3600th part oſ the gravitation at the sea-shore, we mean that the ſall oſ a stone in a second is 3600 times greater than the ſall of the moon in the same time. But we also mean (and this expresses the proportion oſ the tendency of gravitation more purely), that if a stone, when hung on a spring steelyard, drav out the rod of the steelyard to the mark 8600, the same stone, taken up to the distance oſ the moon, will draw it out no further than the mark I. We also mean, that if the stone at the seashore draw out the rod to any mark, it will require 3600 such stones to draw it out to that mark, when the trial is made at the distance oſ the moon. It is not, therefore, in consequence oſ any immedinte pereeption oſ the proportion of the gravitation at the moon to that at the surface oſ the earth that we make such an assertion; but these motions, which we consider as its effects in these situations, being magnitudes of the same kind, are susceptible of comparison, and have a proportion which can be ascertained by nbservation It is these proportions that we contemplate; although we speak of the proportions oſ the unseen causes, the forces, or endeavours to descend. It will be of material service to the reader to peruse Dr Reid's judicious and acute dissertation on quantity in the 45th volume of the Philosophical Transactions; where, we trust, he will see clearly how force, velocity, density, and many other magnitudes of very ſrequent occurrence in mechanieal philosophy, may be made the subjects oſ mathematical discussion, by means oſ some oſ those proper quantities, measurable by their own parts, which are to be assumed as their measures. Pressures are measurable only by pressures. When we consider them as moving powers, we should be able to measure them by any moving powers, otherwise we cannot compare them; iherefore it is not as pressures that we then measure them This observation is momentous. One circumstance must be careſully attended too. That 3 assumed measures may be accurate, they must he invariably connected with the magnitudes which they are employed to measure, and s0 connected, that the degrees oſ the one must change in the same manner with the degrees of the other This is evident, and is granted by all. But we must also know this oſ the measure we employ; we must see this constant and precise relationn. How can we know this? We do not perceive ſoree as a separate existence, 50 as to see its proportions, and to see that these are the same with the proportions oſ the measures, in the same manner that Euelid sees the proportions of triangles and those of their bases, and that these proportions ure the same, when the triangles are of equal altitudes. How do we discover that to every magnitude which we call force is invariably attached a corresponding magnitude oſ aceeleration or deſlection? Clearly. In fact, the very existence oſ the ſorce is an inſerence that we mukè ſrom the ohserved accelerations; and the degree of the ſoree is, in like manner, an inference from the observed magnitude oſ the acceleration. Our measures are thereſore necessarily connected with the magnitudes which they measure, and their proportions are the same; because the one is always an inference ſfrom the other, hoth in species and in degree. I8. It is now evident, that these disquisitions are suseeptible of mathematical accuracy Having seleeted our measures, and ohserved certain mathematical relations oſ those measures, every inſerence that we ean draw from the mathematical relations oſ the proportions of those representations, ĩs true of the proportions oſ the motions, and thereſore oſ the proportions of the forces. And thus dynamics becomes a demonstrative science, one of the disciplinæ uocurataæ. I9. But moving ſorces are eonsidered as differing also in kind; that is, in direction We assign to the foree the direction oſ the observed change oſ motion; which is not only the indication, but also the characteristie, oſ the changing forcee We call it an occlerating, retarding, deflecting, force, according as we observe the motion to be aceelerated, retarded, or deſlected. These denominations shew us incontestably that we have no knovledge of the forees difſerent ſrom our knowledge oſ the eſſectss. The denominations are all either descriptive oſ the eſſects, as when we call them accelerating, penetrating, protrusive, attractive, or repulsive ſorces; or they are names oſ reſerence to the substances in which the accelerating, protrusive, &c. forces, are supposed to be inherent, as when we call them magnetism, electricity, corpuscular, &e. 20. When I struggle with another, and ſeel, that in order to prevent being thrown, I must exert ſorce, I learn that my antagonist is exerting ſoreee This notion is transſerred to matter; and when a moving power which is lnown to operate, produces no motion, ve conceive it to be opposed by another equal ſorce; the existence, ageney, and intensity oſ which is detected and measured by these means. The quiescent state oſ the hody is considered as a change on the state oſ things that would have been exhibited in consequence of the known action of one power, had this other power not acted; and this change is considered as the indication, characteristie, and measure, oſ another power, detected in this way. Thus forces are recognised not only hy the changes oſf motion which they produce; but also by the changes of motion which they prevent. The cohesion oſ matter in a string is inferred not only by its giving motion to a ball which I pull toward me by its intervention, hut also by iĩts suspending that ball, and hindering it ſrom falling I know that gravity is acting on the ball, which, howẽver, does not ſal. The solidity oſ a hoard is equally inſerred ſrom its stopping the ball which strikes it, and from the motion ſ the ball which it drives beſore it. In this way we earn that the prticles oſ tangible matter cohere by means oſ moving ſorces, and that they resist compression with force; and in making this inference, we find that this corpuscular ſorce exerted between the particles is mutual, opposite, and equal; ſor we must apply ſorce equally to a or to b, in order to produce a separation or a compression. We learn their equality, hy observing that no motion ensues while these mutual ſorces are known to act on the particles; that is, each is opposed by another ſorce, which is neither inſerior nor superior to it. OF THE LAWS OF MOTION. Sucu, then, being our notions oſ mechanical forces, the causes oſ the sensible changes oſ motion, there will result certain consequences from them, which may be called axioms, or laws, oſf motion. Some of these may be intuitive, offering themselves to the mind as soon as the notions which they involve are presented to it. Others may be as necessary results ſrom the relations oſ these notions, but may not readily offer themselves without the mediation of axioms of the first classs We shall select those which are intuitive, and may be taken ſfor the first principles of all discussions in mechanical philosophy. FIRST LAW OF MOTION. Every body continues in a state of rest, or of uniſorm rectilineal motion, unless aſyected by some mechanical sorce. 2I. This is a proposition, on the truth of which the whole science oſf mechanical philosophy ultimately depends. It is thereſore to be established on the firmest ſoundation; and a solicitude on this head is the more justifiable, because the opinions of philosophers have been, and still are, extremely difſerent, both with respect to the truth oſ this law, and with respect to the ſoundation on which it is built. These opinions are, in general, very obscure and unsatisſactory; and, as is natural, they inſluence the discussions of those by whom they are held through the whole science. Although oſ contradietory opinions onè only can he just, and it may appear suſficient that this one be established and uniſormly applied; yet a short exposition, at least, oſ the rest is necessary, that the greatest pert of the writings of the philosophers may be intelligible, and that we may avail ourselves oſ much valuahle information contained in them, by being able to perceive the truth in the midst oſ their imperſect or erroneous conceptions oſ it. 22. It is not only the popular opinion that rest is the natural state oſ body, and that motion is something foreign to it, but it has been seriously maintained by the greatest part of those who are esteemed philosophers. They readily grant that matter will continue at rest, unless some moving force act upon it. Nothing seems necessary for matter's remaining where it is, but its continuing to exist. But it is ſar otherwise, say they, with respect to matter in motion. Here the body is continually changing its relations to other things; therefore the continual agency of a changing cause is necessary (by the fundamental principle oſ all philosophical discussion), ſor there is here the continual production oſ an efſect. They say that this metaphysical argument reeeives complete confirmation (if confirmation of an intuitive truth be necessary) ſrom the most ſamiliar observation. We see that all motions, however violent, terminate in rest, and that the continual exertion of some ſorce is necessary ſor their continuance. 23. These philosophers thereſore assert, that the continual action of the moving cause is essentially necessary for the continuance of the motion: but they difſer among themselves in their notions and opinions about this cause. Some muintain, that all the motions in the universe are produced and continued by the immediate agency oſ Deity; others aſfirm, that in every particle oſ matter there is inherent a sort of mind, the y⸗5 and wæę4æ of Aristotle, which they coll an æLEMENT AL ND, which is the cause oſ all its motions and changes. An overweaning reverence for Greek learning has had a great inſluence in reviving this doetrine oſ Aristotle The Greek and Roman languages are aſfirmed to be more accurate expressions of human thought than the modern languages aree In those ancient languages, the verbs which express motion are employed both in the active and pussive voice; whereas we have only the active verb to move, for expressing hoth the state oſ motion and the act oſ putting in motion.  The stone moves down the slope, and moves all thepebhles which lie in its vay: but in the ancient languages, the mere state oſ motion is always expressed by the passive or middle voice. The accurate conception oſ the speakers is thereſore extolledlc The state oſ motion is expressed as it ought to be, as the result oſ a continual action. Enſũ, movelur, is equivalent to it is moved. According to these philosophers, every thing which moves is mind, and every thing thut is moved is body. The argument is ſutile, and it is ſalse; for the modern languages are, in general, equally accurate in this inatance:: 5 mouvoir, in French;  ſich bewegen, in German; dvigatsu, in Slavonic; are all passive or reſlected. And the ancients said, that è rain ſalls, water runs,  smoke rises,” just as we do. The ingenious author of Ancient Metaphysics has taken much pains to give us, at length, the procedures of those elementary minds in producing the ostensible phenomena of local motion; but it seems to be merely an abuse oſ language, and a very Irivolous abusee This elemental mind is known and characterised only by the effect which we aseribe to its action; that is, by the motions or changes oſ motions. Uni- ſorm and unexcepted experience shews us that ſhese are regulated by laws as precise as those oſ mathematical truthh. We consider nothing as more fixed and determined than the common laws oſ mechanism. There is nothing here that indicates any thing like spontaneity. intention, purpose;: none oſ those marks hy which mind was first brought into view: but they are very like the effects which we produce by the exertions of our corporeal ſorees; and we have accordimgly given the name ſorce to the causes oſ motion. It is surely much more apposite than the name mind, and conveys with much more readiness and perspicuity the very notions that we wish to convey. j 24. We now wish to know what reason we have to think that the continual action of some cause is necessary for continuing matter in motion, or ſor thinking that rest ĩs its natural state Iſ we pretend to draw any argument ſrom the nature of matter, that matter must be known, as ſar as is necessary ſor being the foundation oſ argument. Its very existence is known only ſrom ohservation; all our knowledge oſf it must thereſore be derived from the same source. Iſ we take this way to come nt the origin oſ this opinion, we shall ſind that experience gives us no authority for saying that rest is the natural condition of matter. We cannot say that we have ever seen a hody at rest; this is evident to every person who allows the validity oſ the Newtonian philosophy, and the truth oſ the Copernican system oſ the sun and planets; all the parts oſ this system are in motion. Nay, it appears ſrom many observations, that the sun, with his attending planets, ĩs carried in a certain direction, with a velocity which is very greastt. We have no unquestionable authority for saying that any one oſ the stars is absolutely fixed; but we are eriain that many oſ them are in motion. Rest is there- ſore so rare a condition oſ body, that we eannot say, from any experience, that it is its natural state. 25. It is easy, however, to see, that it is from ohservation that this opinion has been derived; but the observation has been limited and caręless Our experiments in this sublunary world do indeed always require continued action of some moving force to continue the motion; and if this be not employed, we see the motions slacken every minute, and terminate in rest aſter no long period. Our first notions oſ sublunary bodies are indicated by their operation in cases where we have some interest. Perpetually seeing our own exertions necessary, we are led to consider matter as something not only naturally quiescent and inert, but sluggish, averse from motion, and prone to rest (we must be pardoned this metaphorical language, because we can find no other term)c. What is expressed by it, on this oceasion, is precisely one oſ the erroneous or inadequate conceptions that are suggested to our thoughts by reason oſ the poverty of language We animate matter in order to give it motion, and then we endow it with a sort oſ moral character in order to explain the appearance oſ those motions. 26. But more extended observation has made men gradually desert their first opinions, and at last allow that matter has no peculiar aptitude to rest. All the retardations that we observe have been discovered, one after another, to have a distinet reſerence to some external circumstances. The diminution oſ motion is always observed to be accompanied by the removal oſ obstacles, as when a ball moves through sand, or water, or air; or it is owing to opposite motions which are destroyed; or it is owing to roughness oſ the path, or to ſriction, &e. We find that the more we can keep those things out oſ the way, the Iess are the motions diminished A pendulum vill vibrate but a short while in water; much longer in air; and in the exhausted receiver, it will vibrate a whole day We know that we cannot remove all obstacles; but we are led by such observations to conclude that, iſ they could he completely removed, our motions would eontinue for ever. And this conclusion is almost demonstrated by the motions oſ the heavenly bodies, to which we know oſ no obstacles, and which we really observe to retain their motions ſor many thousand years without the smallest sensible diminution. 27. Another set oſ philosophers maintain an opinion directly opposite to that oſ the inactivity oſ matter, and assert, that it is essentially active, and continually changing its state. Faint traces oſ this are to be found in the writings oſ Plato, Aristotle, and their commentators Mr Leibnitæ is the person who has treated this question most systematically and full. He supposes every particle of matter to have a principle oſ individuality, which he thereſore calls a Monan. This monad has a sort oſ perception of its situation in the universe, and oſ its relation to every other part oſ this universe. Lastly, he says that the monad acts on the material particle, much in the same way that the soul oſ man acts on his body. It modiſies the motion oſ the material atom (in conſormity, however, to unalterable laws), producing all those modiſfications oſ motion that we ohservee Matter, therefore, or, at least, particles oſ matter, are continually active, and continually changing their situation. It is quite unnecessary to enter on a formal conſutation oſ Mr Leibnits system of monads, which diſſers very little from the system oſ elemental minds, and is equally whimsical and frivolous; because it only makes the unlearned reader stare, without giving him any inſormation. Should it even be granted, it would not, any more than the action of animals, invalidate the general proposition which we are endæavouring to estahlish as the ſundamental law of motionn. Those powers oſ the monads, or oſ the elemental minds, are the causes oſ all the changes of motion; but the mere material particle is subject to the law, and requires the exertion of the monad in order to exhibit a change of motion. 28. A third sect oſ philosophers, at the head of which we may place Sir Isanc Newton, maintain the doctrine enounced in the proposition. But they difſer much in respect of the ſoundation on which it is built. Some assert that its truth ſlows from the nature oſ the thing. If a body be at rest, and you assert that it will not remain at rest, it must move in some one direction. Iſ it be in motion in any direction, and with any velocity, and do not continue its equahle, rectilineal, motion, it must either be accelerated or retarded; it must turn either to one side, or to some other sidlee The event, whatever it be, is individual and determinate; but no cause which can determine it is supposed: thereſore the determination cannot take place, and no change will happen in the condition oſ the hody with respeet to motion. It will eontinue at rest, or persevere in its rectilineal and equable motion. But considerable ohjeetions may he made to this argument, oſ suſficient reason, as it is calledc. In the immensity and perſect uniformity of spuce and time, there is no determining cause why the visible universe should exist in the place in which we see it rather than in another, or at this time rather than at another Nay, the argument seems to heg the questionn. A cause oſ determination is required as essentially necessarya determination may be without a cause, as well as a motion without a cause. 29. Other philosophers, who maintain this doctrine, consider it merely as an experimental truth; and prooſi of its universality are innumerable. When a stone is thrown ſrom the hand, we press it forward while in the hand, and let it go when the hand has acquired the greatest rapidity oſf motion that we can give itt. The stone continues in that state oſ motion which it acquired gradually along with the hand. We can throw a stone much farther by means oſ a sling; because, by a very moderate motion oſ the hand, we can whirl the stone round till it acquire a very great velocity, and then we let go one oſ the strings, and the stone escapes, by continuing its rapid motion. We see it still more distinctly in shooting an arrow from a bow. The string presses hard on the notch of the arrow, and it yields to this pressure and goes forward. The string alone would go fſaster forard. It therefore continues to press the arrow ſorward, and accelerates its motion. This goes on till the bow is as much unbent as the string will allow. But the string is now a straight line. It came into this position with an accelerated motion, and it thereſore goes a little beyond this position, but with a retarded motion, being checked by the bow. But there is nothing to check the arrow; thereſore the arrow quits the string, and ſlies away. These are simple cases oſ perseverance in a state oſ motion, where the procedure oſ nature is so easily traced that we perceive it almost intuitively. It is no less clear in otlher phenomena which are more complicated; but it requires a little reſlection to trace the process We have oſten seen an equestrian showman ride a horse at a gallop, standing on the saddle, and stepping from it to the back of another horse that gallops alongside at the same rate; and he does this seemingly with as much ease as if the horses were standing stil. The man has the same velocity with the horse that gallops under him, and keeps this velocity while he steps to the back oſ the other. Iſ that other were standing still, the man would ſly over his head. And if a man should step ſfrom the back of a horse that is standing still to the back oſ another that gallops past him, he would be leſt behind. In the same manner, æ slack wire dancer tosses oranges ſrom hand to hand while the wire is in full swing The orange, swinging along with the hand, retains the velocity: and when in the air follows the hand, and falls into it when it is in the opposite extremity oſ its swing. A hall, dropped from the mast head oſ a ship that is sailing briskly forward, ſalls at the foot oſ the mast. It retains the motion which it had while in the hand oſ the person who dropped it, and follows the mast during the whole oſ its ſall. We also have ſaniiliar instances oſ the perseverance oſ a body in a state oſ rest. When a vessel filled with water is drawn suddenly along the ſloor, the water dashes over the posterior side oſ the vessel. It is leſt behind. In the same manner, when a coach or boat is dragged forward, the persons in it find themselves strike against the hinder part oſ the carriage or boatt. Properly speaking, it is the carriage that strikes on them. In like manner, if we lay a card on the tip of the finger, and a piece oſf money on the card, we may nick away the card; by hitting it neatly on its edge; but the piece oſ money will be leſt behind, lying on the tip oſ the ſinger. A ball will go through a wall and ſly onward; but the wall is leſt behind. Buildings are theown down by earthquakes; sometimes by being tossed from their foundations, but more generally by the ground on which they stand being hastily drawn sidewise from under them, &e. 30. But common experience seems insuſſicient ſor establishing this ſundamental proposition of mechanieal philosophy. We must, on the ſaith oſ the Copernican system, grant that we never suw a body at rest, or in uniform rectilineal motion; yet this seems ahsolutely necessary beſore we can say that we have established this proposition experimentally. What we imagine, in our experiments, to be putting a hody, formerly at rest, into motion, is, in fact, only changing a most rapid motion, not less, and probably much greater, than 90,000 ſeet per second. Suppose a cannon pointed east, and the Bullet discharged at noon day with 60 times greater velocity than we have ever been able to give it. It would appear to set out with this unmeasurable velocity to the eastward; to be gradually retarded by the resistance oſ the air, and at last brought to rest by hitting the ground. But, by reason of the earths motion round the sun, the ſact is quite the reverse. Immediately beſore the discharge, the ball was moving to the westward with the velocity oſ 90,000 ſeet per second nearly. By the explosion oſ the powder, and its pressure on the hall, some oſ this motion is destroyed, and at the muzzle oſ the gun, the hall is moving slower, and the eannon is hurried away ſrom it to the westward. The air, which is also moving to the westward 90,000 ſeet in a second, gradually communicates motion to the ball, in the suame manner as a hurricane would doo. At last (the ball dropping all the while) some part oſ the ground hits the ball, and carries it along with it. Other observations must therefore be resorted to, in order to obtain an experimental prooſ oſ this proposition. And such are to be found. Although we cannot measure the absolute motions of hodies, we can observe and measure accurately their relative motions, which are the diſſerences of their absolute motions. Now, if we can shew experimentally, that bodies shew equal tendencies to resist the augmentation and the diminution of their relative motions, they, ipso facto, shew equal tendencies to resist the augmentation or diminution oſ their absolute motions. Therefore let two bodies, A and B, be put into such a situation, that they cannot, (by reason oſ their impenetrability, or the actions oſ their mutual powers) persevere in their relative motions. The change produced on A is the effect and measure oſ Bs tendency to persevere in ils former state; and thereſore the proportion oſf ſhese changes will shew the proportion of their tendencies to maintain their ſormer statess Thereſore let the ſollowing experiment be made at noon. Let A, apparently moving westward three ſeet per second, hit the equal hody B apparently at rest. S8uppose, lat, That A impels B ſforward, without any diminution oſ its own velocity. This result would shew that B maniſests no tendency to maintain its motion unchanged, but that A retains its motion undiminished. aly, Suppose that A stops, and that B remains at rest. This would shew that A does not resist a diminution of motion, but that B retains its motion unaugmented. 3iuly, Suppose that both move westward with the velocity oſ one foot per second. The change on A is a diminution of velocity, amounting to two feet per second. This is the efſfect and the measure oſ B's tendency to maintain its velocity unaugmentedl. The change on B is an augmentation oſ one ſoot per second made on its velocity; and this is the measure of As tendency to maintuin its velocity undiminished. This tendency is but half oſ the ſormer; and this result would shew, that the resistance to a diminution oſ velocity is but halſ oſ the resistance to augmentation. It is perhaps hut one quarter; ſor the change on B has produced a double change on A. dAihly, Suppose that both move westward at the rate of 15 ſeet per second. It is evident that their tendencies to maintain their states unchanged are now equal. 5thly, Suppose A  2 B, and that both move, aſter the collision, two feet per second, B has received an addition oſ two feet per second to its ſormer velocity. This is the eſfeet and the measure of A's whole tendency to retain ils motion undiminished. Halſ of this change on B meosures the persevering tendency of the halſ oſ A but A, which formerly moved with the apparent or relative velocity three, now moves (by the supposition) with the velocity two, having lost a velocity oſ one ſoot per second. Each halſ oſ A therefore has lost this velocity, 2 and the whole loss of motion is two. Now this is the measure oſ B's tendency to maintain its ſormer state unaugmented; and this Is the samo with the measure oſ A's tendency to maintain its own ſormer state undiminished. The conclusion from such a result would thereſore be, that bodies have equal tendencies to maintain their ſormer states oſf motion without augmentation and without diminution. What is supposed in the 4th and 5th cases Is really the result oſ all the experiments which have been tried; and this Iuw regulates all the changes oſ motion which are produced by the mutual actions oſ hodies in impulsions. This assertion is true without exception or qualſiſication. Thereſore it appears, that bodies have no preſerable tendency to rest, and that no ſfact can be adduced which should make us suppose that a motion once begun should suſſer any diminution without the action of a changing canse But we must now observe, that this way oſ establishing the first law oſ motion is very imperſect, and altogether unſfit ſor rendering it the fundamental principle of a whole and extensive sciencee It is subject to all the inaccuracy that is to he found in our best experiments; and it cannot be applied to eases where scrupulous accuracy is wanted, and where no experiment can he made. Let us thereſore examine the proposition, and we shall find it to he an axiom or intuitive eonsquenee of the relations oſ those ideas which we have oſ motion, and oſ the causes oſ its production and changes S1. It has been ſully demonstrated that thq powers or forces, oſ which we speak s much, are never the immediate ohjects oſ our perceptionn. Their very oxistence, their kind, and their degree, are instinctive inſerences ſrom the motions whith we observe and classs It eviiently ſollows ſrom this experimental and universol truth, lat, That whęre no change of motivn is okrved, no VOL. I. c 34 DYNAMICS: such inference is made; that is, no power is supposed o act. But whenever any change oſ motion is observeq, the inſerence is made; that is, a power or force is supposed to have acted. ] In the same ſorm of logical conclusion, ve must say that, Rdly, When no change oſ motion is supposed or thought of, no force is supposed; and that whenever ve suppose a change oſ motion, we, in fact, though not in terms, 3uppose a changing forcee And, on the other hand, whenever we suppose the action of a changing ſorce; we suppose the change of motion; ſor the action oſ this ſorce, and the change oſ motion, is one and the same thing. We cannot think of the action without thinking oſ the indication oſ that action; that is, the change ofrmotion.In the same manner, when we do not think of a changing force, or suppose that there is no action of a ehanging force, ve, in fact, though not in terms, suppose that there is no indication of this changing ſorce: that is, that there is no change Whenever, thereſore, ve suppose that no mechanieal ſorce is acting on a body, we, in ſact, suppose that the body continues in its ſormer condition with respect to motion. If we suppose that nothing accelerates, or retards, or deſlects the motion, ve suppose that it is not accelerated, nor retarded, nor deſlected. Hence follows the proposition in express terms We suppose that the body continues in ils former slate of rest or motion, unless we suppose that it is changed by some mechanical force. Thus it appears, that this proposition is not a matter of experience or contingency, depending on the properties which it has pleased the Author oſ Nature to bestow on body: it is, to us, a necessary truth. The proposition does not so much express any thing with regard to body, as it does the operations of our mind when contemplating body. It may perhaps be essential to body to move in some particular direction. It may be essential  body t6 stop as soon as the moving cause has ceased to mt; or it may be essential to body to diminish its motion gradually, and finally come to rest. But this will not inalidate the truth oſ this propositionn. These circumstances in the nature oſ body, which render those modifications of motion essentially necessary, are the causes oſ those modiſications; and, in our study of nature, they vill be considered by us as changing forces, and vill be nown and called by that name. And if we should ever e a particle of matter in such a situation that it is aſſected by those essential properties alone, we shall, ſrom observation of its motion, discover what those essential properties are: This law turns out at last to he little more than a tautological proposition: But mechanical philosophy, as we have defined it, requires no other sense oſ it; for, even iſ we should suppose that body, of its own nature, is capable oſ changing its stute, this change must be perſormed aceording to some law which characterises the nature of hody ; and the knowledge of the law ean be had in no other way than by observing the deviations from uniſorm reetiũlineal motion: It is thereſore indifſerent whether ſhose ehanges are derived from the nature oſ the thing, or ſrom external causes; ſor in order to consider the various motions of bodies;, ve must first consider this nature of matter as a mechanical affection oſ matter, openting in every instance; and thus we are hrought back to the law enounced in this propositionn. This becomes more certain when we reſlect that the external causes (such as gravity or magnetism), which are acknowledged lo operate changes oſ motion, are equally unknown to us vith this essential original property oſ nature, and are, lite it, nothing but inſerences from the phenomena. The above very diſſuse discussions may appear superſlusus to many readers, and even cumbersome; but we trust that the philosophical render will exeuse our anxiety on this head, when he reſlects on the complicated, indistinct, and inaccurate notions commonly had of the subject; and more especially when he ohserves, that oſ those who maintain the truth of this ſundamental proposition, as we have enounced it, many (and they too oſ the first eminence) reject it in ſact, hy combining it with other opinions which are inconsistent with it, nay, which contradiet it in express terms. We may even include Sir ,Isaac Newton in the number of those who have at least introduced modes oſ expression which mislead the minds oſ incautious persons, and suggest inadequate notions, incompatible with the pure doctrine of the proposition. Although, in words, they disclaim the doctrine that rest is the natural state oſ body, and that force is necessary for the continuation oſ ita motion, yet in words they (and most oſ them in thought) likewise abet that doctrine; ſor they say, that there resides in a moving body a pouwer or force, by which it perseveres in its motion. They call it the vis iuara, the INNERENT FORCE OF A 6OVING BODY. This is surely giving up the question; for if the motion is supposed to be continued in consequence oſ a force, that foree is supposed to he exerted; and it is supposed, that iſ it were not exerted, the motion would cease; and therefore the proposition must be ſalsee Indeed it is sometimes expressed so as seemingly to ward off this objection. It is said, that the body continues in uniſorm rectilineal motion, unless aſſected by some external cause. But this way oſ speaking obliges us, at ſirst setting out in natural philosophy, to assert that gravity, magnetism, electricity, and a thousand other mechanical powers, are external to the matter which they put in motionn. This is quite improper: It is the business oſ philosophy to discover whether they be external or not; and if we assert that they are, ve have n prineiples oſ argumentation with those who deny it. It is this one thing that has filled the study oſ nature with all the jargon oſ æthers mã other invisible intangible fluids, which has dis graced philosophy, and greatly retarded its progress. 32. We must observe, that the terms vis insita, inherent force, are very improper. There is no dispute among philosophers in ealling every thing a fore that produces a change oſ motion, and in inſerring the action of such a foree whenever we observe a change oſ motion. Tt is surely incongruous to give the same name to what has not this quality oſ produeing a change, or to infer (or rather to suppose) the energy of a force when no change of motion is observedl. This is one among many instances oſ the danger oſ mistake when we indulge in anulogical discussions. All our language, at least on this subjeet, is analogous. I ſeel, that in order to oppose animal force, I must exert ſore. But I must exert foree in order to oppose a hody in motion: Thereſore I imagine that the moving hody possesses ſorce:. A hent spring will drive a body ſorward hy unbending: Thereſore I say that the spring exerts forceee A moving hody impels the hody which it hits: Thereſore I say, that the impelling hody possesses and exerts force. I imagine ſarther, that ĩt possesses ſoree only by heing in motion, or because it is in motion; because I do not find that a quieseent hody vill put another into motion by touching it. But we shall soon find this to be ſalse in many, if not in all cases, and that the communication of motion depends on the mere vicinity, and not on the motion, oſ the impelling body; yet we ascribe the exertion oſ the vis insitu to the cireumstance oſ the continued motion. We thereſore concoive the force as arising from, or as consisting in, the impelling body's being in motion; and, with a very obscure and indistinct conception oſ the whole matter, we eall it the firce by which the body preserves itself in motionn. Thus, taking it for granted that a ſorce resides in the hody, and being obliged to give it some oſſice, this is the only one that ve can think oſ. But philosophers imagine that they perceive the necessity of the exertion of a force in order to the continuation oſ a motion. Motion (say they) is a continued action; the body is every instant in a new situation; there is the continual production of an eſſect, thereſore the continued action oſ a causeS3. But this is a very inaccurate way of thinking. We have a distinct conception of motion; and we conceive that there is such a thing as a moving cause, which we distinguish from all other causes by the name forcee It produces motion. If it does this, it produces the character oſ motion, which is a continual change oſ place. Motion is not action, but the efſect of an action; and this action is as complete in the instant immediately sueceeding the beginning oſ the motion as it is a minute aſter. The subsequent change of place is the continuation oſ an eſfect already produced. The immediate effect of the moving force is a nETERMINATION, by which, iſ not hindered, the body would go on for ever ſrom place to place. It is in this determination only that the state or condition oſ the body can difſer from a state oſ rest; for in any instant, the body does not describe any space, but has a determination by which it will deseribe a certain space uniſormly in a certain time. Motion is a condition, a state, or mode, oſ existence, and no more requires the continued agency of the moving cause than yellowness or roundness does. It requires some chemical agency to change the yellowness to greenness; and iĩt requires a mechanical cause or a force to change this motion into rest. When we see a moving body stop short in an instant, or be gradually, but quickly, brought to rest, ve never fail to speculate about a cause oſ this cessation or retardation. The case is no way difſerent in itself although the retardation should be extremely slow. We should always attribute it to a cause. It requires a cause to put a hody out oſf motion as much as to put ĩt into motionn This eause, iſ not external, must be ſound in the hody itselſ; and it must have a self-determining power, and may as. well be able to put itself into motion as out of it. If this reasoning be not admitted, we do not see how any efſect can be produced by any cause. Every efſect supposes something done; and any thing done implies that the thing done may remain till it be undone by some other cause. Without this, it would have no existence If a moving cause did not produce continued motion by its instantaneous action, it could not produce it by any continuance oſ that action; because in no instant oſ that action does it produce continued motion. We must thereſore give up the opinion, that there resides in a moving hody a force by which it is kept in motion; and we must ſind some other way of explaining that remarkable diſſerence between a moving hody and a hody at rest, by which the first eauses other bodies to move hy hitting them, while the other does not do this by merely touching them. We shall see, with the clearest evidence, that motion is necessary in the impelling body, in order that it may permit the forces inherent in one or both hodies to continue this pressure long enough ſor producing a sensible or considerable motion. But these moving ſorces are inherent in bodies, whether they are in motion or at rest. 34. The foregoing observations shew us the impropriety oſ the phrase communication of motionn. By thus reſleeting on the notions that are involved in the general conception of one body being made to move by the impulse of another, we perceive, that there is nothing individual transferred from the one body to the otherr. The determination to motion, indeed, existed only in the impelling body before collision; whereas, aſterwards, hoth bodies are so onditiomed or determined But we can form no notion ſthe thing trunsſerredd With the same metaphysical improprièty, wo speik oſ the communication oſ joy, of fever. 35. Kepler introduced a term inERTIA, VIS INERTIE, into meehanieal philosophy; anid it is now in eonstant use. But writers aræe very careless and vague in the notions which they aſfix to these terms. Kepler and Newton seem generally to employ it ſor expressing the ſact, the perseverance oſ the body in its present state oſ motion or rest; but they also ſrequently express by it something like an indifferenco to motion or rest, maniſested by its requiring the sume quantity of force lo make an augmeniotion of its motion as to make an equal diminution of itt. The popular notion is like that which we have oſ actual resistance; -and it always implies the notion of ſforce exerted by the resisting hody. We suppose this to be the exertion oſ the »is insita, or the inherent force of a body in motionn But we have the same notion oſ resistance from a body at rest which ve set in motion. Now, surely it is in direct contradietion to the common use oſ the word force, when we suppose resistance ſrom a body at rest: yet vis inertiæ is a very common expression. Nor is it more absurd (and it is very absurd) to say, that a body maintains its state oſ rest by the exertion oſ a vis inertiæ, than to say, that it maintains its state of motion by the exertion of an inherent Jorce. We should avoid all sueh metaphorical expressions as resistance, indifference, aluggishness, or proneness to reat (7hich some express by inertia), because they seldom ſail to make us indulge in metaphorical notions, and thus lead us to misconceive the modus operandi, or procedure of nature. There is no resistance whatever observed in these phenomena; ſor the ſorcæ employed always produces its œmplete efſectt. When I throw down a man, and find that I have employed no more force than was sufficient to throw down a similar and equal mass of dead matter, I know by this that he has not resisted; but I eonelude that he ſas resisted, iſ I have been obliged to employ mueh more ſorce. There is thereſoræ no resistance, properly so ealled, when the exerted ſoree is ohserved to produce its ſull efſſect To say that there is resistance, is thereſore a real misconception oſ the way in which mechanical forces have operated in the collizion oſ hodies. There is no more resistance in these cases than in any other natural changes oſ eondition. We are guilty, however, oſ the same impropriety oſ language in other cases, where the cause oſ it is more evident. We say that eolours in grain resist the action of soap and oſ the sun, but that the Prussian bluæ does no. We all perceive, that in this expression the word resistanæ is entirely figurative; and we should say that Prussian blue rersiata soap, if we are right in saying that a body resists any force employed to change its state of motion; for soap must be employed to discharge or change the colour; and it does chunge it. Force must be employed to change a motion; and it does change it. The impropriety, both oſ thought and language, is plain in the one case, and it is no less real in the other. Both oſ the terms, inherent foree and inertia, may be used with saſety ſor abbreviating language, i we be careſul to employ them only ſor expressing, either the simple fact of persevering in the former state, or the necessity of employing u certain delerminate force, in order to change that state, and if e avoid all thought of resistance. 36. From the whole oſ this discussion we learn, that the deviations ſrom uniſorm motions are the indieations of the existence and ageney oſ mechanical forees, and that they are the only indieations. The indication is very simple, mere change oſ place; it can thereſore indicate nothing but what is very simple, the something competent to the produetion oſ the very motion that we ohserve. And when two changes oſ motion are precisely similar, they indicate the same thing. Suppose a mariners compass on the table, and that by a small tap with my finger T càuse the needle to turn off ſrom its quiescent position IO degrees. I can do the same thing by bringing a magnet near it; or by bringing an electrified body near it; or by the unbending oſ a fine spring pressing it aside; or by a puſf of wind; or by several other methods. In all these cases, the indication ĩs the same; therefore the thing indicated is the same, namely, a certain intensity and direction of a moving power. How it operates, or in what manner it exists and exerts itselſ in these instances, outwardly so different, is not under consideration at present. Impulsiveness, intensity, and direction, are all the circumstances oſ resemblance by which the affections of matter are to be characterised; and it is to the discovery and determination of these alone that our attention is now to be directed We are directed in this research by the SBECOND LAW OF MOTION. Every change of motion is proportional to the force impressed, and is made in the direction of that force 87. This law also may almost be considered as an identical proposition; for it is equivalent to saying, that the changing force is to be measured by the change which it produces, and that the direction of this force is the direetion oſ the change. Oſ this there can be no doubt, when we consider the ſorce in no other sense than that oſ the cause of motion, paying no attention to the ſorm or manner of its exertion. Thus, when a pellet oſ tow is shot ſrom a pop-gun by the expansion oſ the air compressed by the rammer, or where it is shot from a toy pistol by the unbending oſ the coiled wire, or when it is nicked away by the thumb like a marbleif, in all these cases, it moves off in the same direction, and with the same velocity, we cannot consider or think of the force, or at least oſ its exertion, as any how diſſerent. Nay, when it is driven ſorward by the instantaneous percussion oſ a smart itroke, although the manner oſ producing this efſect iſ possible) is essentially difſerent from what is conceived in the other cases, ve must still think that the propelling ſorce, considered as a propelling ſorce, is one and the same. In short, this law oſ motion, as thus expressed by Sir Isaac Newton, is equivalent to saying,  That we iake the changes oſ motion as the measures oſ the changing ſorces, and the direction oſ the change ſor the indication oſ the direction of the forces;? For no reſlecting person can pretend to say, that it is a deduction from the aeEnow ledged principle, that efſects are proportional to their causes. We do not affirm this law, ſrom having ohserved the proportion oſ the forces and the proportion oſ the changes, and that these proportions are the same; and ſrom having observed that this has obtained through the whole extent oſ our study of naturee This would indeed establish it as a physical law, an universal fact; and it is in ſact so established. But this does not establish it as a Iaw oſ motion, according to our deſinition of that term; as a law oſ human thought, the result oſ the relations of our ideas, as an intuitive truth. The injudicious attempts of philosophers to prove it as a matter of observation, have occasioned the only dispute that has arisen in mechanieal philosophy. It is well known, that a bullet, moving with double velocity, penetrates ſour times as ſar. Many other similar ſacts corroborate this: and the philosophers observe, that ſour times the ſorce has heen expended to generate this double velocity in the hullet; it requires four times as much powder. In all the examples oſ this kind, it would seem that the ratio oſ the forces employed has been very accurately ascertained; yet this is the invariable result. Philosophers, thereſore, have concluded, that moving forees are not proportional to the velocities which they produce, but to the squares oſ these velocities. It ĩs a strong confirmation, to see that the bodies in motion seem to possess forces in this very proportion, and produce eſfects in this proportion; penetrating ſour times as deep when the velocity is only twice as great, &e. But if this be a just estimation, we cannot reconcile iĩt to the concession of the same philosophers, who grant that the velocity is proportional to the force impressed, in the cases vhere we have no previous observation of the ratio oſ the forces, and of its equality to the ratio oſ the velocities. This is the case with gravity, which these philosophers always measure by its accelerating power, or the velocity which it generates in a given time. And this cannot he reſused by them; ſor cases oceur, where the ſorce can be measured, in the most natural manner, by the actual pressure which it exerts. Gravity is thus measured by the pressure which a stone exerts on its supports. A weight which at Quito will pull out the rod of a spring steelyard to the mark 312, will pull it to S13 at Spitæbergen. And it is a ſaet, that a body will ſall 3IS inches at Spitzbergen in the same time that it ſalls 312 at Quito. Gravitation is the cause both oſ the pressure and the ſall; and it is a matter oſ unexcepted observation, that they have always the same ratio. The philosophers who have 50 strenuously mauintained the other measure oſ forces, are among the most eminent oſ those who have examined the motions produced by gravity, magnetism, electricity, &e.; and they never think oſ measuring those forces any other way than hy the velocity. It is in this way that the whole of the celestial phenomena are explained in perfect uniformity with observation, and that the Newtonian philosophy is considered as a demonstrative science. There must, thereſore, be some deſect in the principle on which the other measurement of ſorces is built, or in the method of applying it. Pressure is undoubtedly the immediate and natural measure oſ ſorce; yet we know that four springs, or a how four times as strong, give only a double velocity to an arrow. The truth oſ our law rests on this only, that we assume the changes oſ motion as the measure oſ the changing ſorces; or, at least, as the measures of theiræxertions in producing motionn In ſact, they are the measures only of a certain circumstance, in which the actions oſ very difſferent natural powers may resemble each other; namely, the competency to produce motion. They do not, perhaps, measure their competency to produce heat, or even to bend springs We can surely consider this apart from all other circumstances; and it is worthy oſ separate considerution. Let us see what can he, and what ought to be, deduced from this way of treating the subject. 38. The motion oſa body may certainly remain unchanged. Iſ the direction and velocity remain the same, we perceive no circumstance in which its condition, with respeet to motion, difſers. Its change oſ place or situation can make no difference; for this is implied in the very circumstance oſ the bodies being in motion. But iſ either the velocity or direction change, then surely is its mechanieal condition no longer the same; a force has acted on it, either intrinsic or from without, cither accelerating, or retarding, or deſlecting it. Supposing the direction to remain the same, its difference oſ condition can consist in nothing but its difference oſ velocity. This is the only circumstance in which its condition can differ, as it passes through two different points oſ its rectilineal path. It is this determination by which the body will describe a certain determinate space uniſormly in a given time, which defines its condition as a moving hody: the changes oſ this determination are the measures oſ their own causes;and to those causes we have given the name sforce. Those eauses may reside in other bodies, which may have other properties, characterised and measured by other effects. Pressure may be one of those properties, nd may have ĩits ovn measures; these may, or may not, lave the same proportion with that property which is the ause ofr a change oſ velocity: and thereſore changes oſ velocity may not he a measure oſ pressure This is æ question of fact, and requires observation and experience; but, in the mean time, velocity, and the change oſ velocity, is the measure oſf moving ſorce and of changing ſorce. When thereſore the change of veloeity is the same, whatever the previous velocity may be, the changing ſorce must be considered as the same: therefore, finally, if the previous velocity is nothing, and consequently the change on that body is the very velocity or motion that it acquires, we must say that the foree which produces a certain change in the velocity of a moving body, is the same with the force which would impart to a hody at rest a velocity equal to this change or difſerence oſ velocity produced on the body already in motion. This manner oſ estimating force is in perfect conformity to our most ſamiliar notions on these subjectss We conceive the weight or downward pressure oſ a body as the rause of its motion downwards; and we conceive it as belonging to the body at all times, and in all places; whether ſalling, or rising upwards, or describing a parabola, or lying on a table; and, accordingly, we observe, that in every state oſ motion it reeeives equal changes of velocity in the same, or an equal time, and all in the direetion oſ its pressure. l All that we have now said oſ a ehange of velotity might be repeated oſ a change oſ direction. It is surely possible that the same change of direction may be made on any two motions. Let one of the motions be considered as growing continually slower, and terminating in rest. In every instant oſ this motion it is possible to make one and the same change on it. The same ehange may thereſore be made at the very instant that the motion is at an end. In this case, the change is the very motion which the body acquires from the changing force. Thereſore, in this case also, we must say, that a change oſ motion is ; itselſ a motion, and that it is the motion which the ſorce would produce in a body that was previously at rest. The result oſ these observations is evidently this, that we must ascertain, in every instance, what is the change oſ motion, and mark it by characters that are conspicuous and distinguishing; and this mark and measure oſ change must be a motion: Then we must say, that the changing foree is that which would produce this motion in a body previously at rest. We must see how this is maniſest, as æ change oſ motion is the difference between the ſormer motion and the new motion; and, on the other hand, we must see how the motion produceable in a quiescent hody may he 30 comhined with a motion already existing, as to exhihit a new motion, in which the agency oſ the changing ſorce may appear. Suppose a ship at anchor in a stream:; while one man walks ſforward on the quarter deck at the rate oſ two miles per hour, another walks ſrom stem to stern at the same rate, a third walks athwart ship, and a fourth stands still. Let the ship be supposed to cut or part her cable, and ſloat down the stream at the rate oſ three miles per hour. We eannot conceive any difference in the change made on each mans motion in absolute space; but their motions are now exceedingly difſerent ſrom what they were: the first man, whom we may suppose to have been walking westward, is now moving eastward one mile per hour; the second is moving eastward four miles per hour; and the third is moving in an oblique direction, about three points north or south oſ due east. All have suſfered the same change of condition with the man who had been standing stil. He has now got a motion eastward three miles per hour. In this instance, we see very well the circumstance oſ sameness that obtains in the change of these four conditions. It is the motion oſ the ship, which is blended with the other motions. But this circumstance is equally present whenever the same previous motions are changed into the same new motionss We must learn to expiscate this; which we shall do, by considering the manner in which the motion oſ the ship is blended with each of the men's motions. 42. This kind oſ combination has been called the couPOSITION OF MOTION; because, in every point of the motion really pursued, the two motions are to be ſound. The ſundamental theorem on this subject is this:Two uniform motions in the sides oſ a parallelogram compose an uniſorm motion in the diagonal. Suppose that a point A (Plate I. fig. 1.) deseribes AB uniſormly in some given time, while the line AB is carried uniformly along AC in the same time, keeping always parallel to its first position AB. The point A, by the combination of these motions, will describe AD, the diagonal oſ the parallelogram ABDC, uniſormly in the same time. For it is plain, that the velocities in AB and AC are proportional to AB and AC, hecause they are uniformly deseribed in the same time. When the point has got to E, the middle of AB, the line AB has got into the situaation GH, half way between AB and CD, and the point E is in the place è, the middle of GH. Drav E e L parallel to AC. It is plain, that the parullelograms ABDC and AE e G are similar; because AE and AG are the halves of AB and AC, and the angle at A is common to both. Therefore, (Euelid, Book VI. Prop. xxvi.) they are about the same diagonal, and the point e is in the diagonal of AD. In like manner, it may he shewn, that when A has described AF, ſths oſ AB, the line AB will be in the situation IE, so that AI is ſths oſ AC, and the point f, in which A is now ſound, is in the diagonal AD. It will be the same in whatever point of AB the deseribing point A be supposed to be ſound. The line AB will be on a similar point of AC, and the deseribing point will bæ in the diagonal AD. 2 Moreover, the motion in AD is uniſorm; ſor Ae is deseribed in the time oſ deseribing AE; that is, in halſ the time of deseribing AB, or in halſ the time oſ describing AD. In like manner, A ſ is described in ĩths oſ the time of descrihing AD, &e. &e. Lastly, the velocity in the diagonal AD is to the velocity in eĩther oſ the sides as AD is to that side This is evident, because they are uniformly described in the same time. This is justly ealled a composition of the motions AB and AC, as will appear hy considering it in the ſollowing manner: Let the lines AB AC be conceived as two material lines like wiress. Let AB move uniſormly from the situation AB into the situation CD, while AC moves uniſormly into the situation BD. It is plain, that their intersection will always be found on AD. The point e, ſor example, is a point common to hoth liness. Considered as a point oſf EL, it is then moving in the direction e H or AB; and, considered as a point of GH, it is moving in the direction e L. Both of these motions are thereſore blended in the motion oſ. the interseetion along AD. We can conceive a small ring at e, embracing loosely both of the wires. This material ring will move in the diagonal, and uill really pariake oſ both motions. Thus we see how the motion oſ the ship is acthally blended with the motions of the three men; and the circumstance of sameness which is to be found in the four changes oſ motion is this motion of the ship, or oſ the man who was stunding stil. By composition with each oſ the three former motions, it produces each oſ the three new motionss. Now, when each oſ two primitive motions is the same, and each of the new motions is the same, the thange is surely the same. If one oſ the changes has been brought about by the actual composition oſ motions, we mow precisely what that change is; and this inſorms us YOL. I b what the other ĩs, in whatever way it was produced. Hence we infer, that 43. When a motion is any how changed, the change is that motion which, when compounded with the former motion, will produce the ne motion. Now, because we assume the change as the measure and characteristic oſ the changing force, we must do so in the present instance; and we must say, 44. That the changing force is that which will produce in  quiescent body the motion which, by composition with the Sormer motion of a body, will produce the new motion. And, on the other hand, Wnhen the motion of a body is changed by the action of any Jorce, the new motion is that which is compounded of the former motion, und of the motion which the ſorce would produs in a quiescent body. When a force changes the direction of a motion, we see that its direction is transverse in some angle BAC; because a diagonal AD always supposes two sides. As we have distinguished any change oſ direction by the term pEFLECTION, We may call the transverse force a nEPLECTING FORCE. In this way oſ estimating a change oſ motion, all the characters oſ both motions are preserved, and it expresse: every circumstance oſ the change; the mere change oſ direetion, or the angle BAD, is not enough, hecause the same ſorce will make difſerent angles oſ deſlection, according to the velocity oſ the ſormer motion, or according to its direction: but in this estimation, the ſull effeet oſ the deflecting force is seen; it is seen us a motion; for when half of the time is elapsed, the body is at e instead of E; when three-fourths are elapsed, it is at f instend of F; and at the end oſ the time it is at D instead oſ B. In short, the body has moved uniſormly away from the points at which it would have arrived independent oſ the change; and this motion has been in the same direction, and at the same rate, as if it had moved ſfrom A to C by the changing ſoree alone. Each force has produeed its ſull effect; for when the hody is at D, it is as ſar ſfrom AC as iſ the ſoree AC had not acted on it; and it is as ſar ſrom AB as it would have heen by the action of AC alone. :i For all these reasons, thereſore, it is evident, that if we are to abide by our measure and character oſ foree as a mere producer of motion, ve have selected the proper characteristic and measure oſ a changing foree; and our tleseriptions, in conformity to this seleetion, must bo agreeuble to the phenomena oſ nature, and retain the aceuracy of geometrieal procedure; because, on the other hand, the results which we deduee from the supposed inſluence oſ those ſorees are ſormed in the same mould. It is not even requisite that the real exertions of the natural forces, such as pressure oſ various kinds, &e. shall follow these rules; for their deviations will be considered as new ſorees; although they are only indications of the diſferences of the real forees from our hypothesis We hare obtained the precious advantage of mathematical investigation, by which we can examine the law of exertion which eharaeterises every ſoree in nature. On these principles we establish the ſollowing fundomental elementary proposition, oſ continual and indispensable use in all mechanical inquiries. 45. Ifa body or material particle be subjected ul the :ome lime to the action of two moving forces, each of which would separalely cause it to describe ihe side of a purullelogram uniformly in a given time, the body will deseribe the diagonal uniformly in the same time. For the boidy, whose motion AB was changed into AD, ud gotten its motion by the action of some foree It ras moving along NAB; and, when it reached the point , the force AC acted on it. The priinitive motion i the same, or the body is in the same condition in every instant of the primitive motion. It may huve acquired this motion when it was in N, or when at O, or any other point of NA. In all these cases, i AC act on it when it is in A, it will always describe AD; thereſore it will describe AD when it acquires the primitive motion also in A; that is, if the two forces act on it at one and the same instant. The demonstration may be neatly expressed thus: The change induced by each force on the motion produced by the other, is the motion which it would produce in the body if previously at rest. Thereſore the motion resulting ſrom their joint action is the motion which is compounded of these two motions; or it is a motion in the diagonal of the parallelogram, oſf which these motions are the sides. TThis is called the CourosiTioN or ForcEs. The forces which produce the motions along the sides oſ the parallelogram are called the SiupLE ForcEs, or the ConsTi70ENT ForcES; and the force which would alone produce the motion along the diagonal is called the CourousD ForcE, the RESULTING ForcE, the EquivanLesT ForcE. 46. On the other hand, the force which produces a motion along any line whatever, may be conceived as resulting ſrom the combined action of two or more ſorces. We may now or observe it to be so; as when we see a lighter dragged along a canal by two horses, one on each side: Each pulls the boat directly toward himself in the direetion oſ the track-rope; the hoat cannot go both ways; and its real motion, whatever it is, results ſrom this comhined action. This might be produced by a single ſorce; for example, iſ the lighter be dragged along the canal by a rope ſrom another lighter which precedes it, being dragged by one horse, aided by the helm oſ the foremost lighter. Here the real force is not the resulting, or the compound, hut the equivalent force. This view oſ a motion, mechanieally produced, is called ithe RESoLurON oF Forcæs. The ſorce in the diagonal is said to he resolved into the two forces, having the directions and velocities represented by the sidess. This practice is of the most extensive and multiſarious use in all mechanical disquisitionss It may ſrequently be exceedingly difficult to manage the complication oſ the many real forces which eoncur in producing a phenomenon; and by substituting others, whose combined efſects are equivalent, our investigation may be much expedited. But more of this aſterwards. We must careſully remember, that when the motion AD is once hegun, all composition is at an end, and the motion is a simple motion. The two determinations, by one of which the hody would describe AB, and by the other of which it would deseribe AC, no longer co-exist in the body. This was the case only in the instunt, in the very act of changing the motion AB into the motion BD; yet is the motion AD equivalent to a motion which is produced by the actual composition of two motions AB and AC; in which case the two motions co-exist in every point oſ AD. 47. Accordingly, this is the way in which the composition of forces is usually illustrated, and thought to he demonstratedl. A man is supposed (for instance) to walk uniſormly from A to C on a sheet oſ ice, while the ice is earried uniſormly along AB by the stream. The mans real motion is undoubtedly along AD; but this is by no means a demonstration that the instantaneous or shortlived action of two forces would produce that motion; the man must continue to exert fſorce in order to walk, and the ice is dragged along hy the stream. Some indeed express this prooſ in another way, snying, let a hody describe AB, while the space in which this motion is perſormed is carried along ACC. The ice may be carried along, and may, by ſriction, or otherwise, drag the man ilong with it; but a space cannot be removed ſrom one lace to another, nor, iſ it could, would it take the man vith it. Bhould a ship start suddenly forward while a man is walking across the deck, he would be left behind, and ſall toward the sternn. We must suppose a transverse ſorce, and we must suppose the composition of this force vithout prooſ. This is no demonstration. We apprehend, that the demonstration given above oſ this fundamental proposition is une xceptionable, when the terms force and deftection are used in the ahstract sense which we have affixed to them; and we hope, by these means, to maintain the rigour of mathematical discussion in all our future disquisitions on these suhjects. The only circumstance in it which can be the subject oſ disoussion is, whether we have selected the proper measurè and characteristic of a change oſ motionWe never met with any ohjection to it. 48. But some have still maintained, that it does not evidently appear, ſrom these principles, that the motion which results from the joint action oſ two natural powers, whose known and measurable intensities have the same proportions with AB and BC, and which also exert themselves in those directions, will produce a motion, having the direction and proportion of AD. They will not, iſ the velocities produced by these ſorces are not in the proportion of those intensities, but in the subduplicate ratio oſ them. Nay, they say, that it is not so. Iſ a body be impelled along AC by one spring, and along AB by two springs equally strong, it will not deseribe the diagonal oſ a parallelogram, oſf which the side AB is double the side ACC. Nay, they add, that an indeſinite number of examples can be given where a body does not describe the diagonal oſ the parallelogram by the joint action of two ſorces, which, separately, would cause it to describe the sides. And, lastly, they say, that, at any rate, it does not appear evident to the mind, that two incitements to motion, having the directions and the same proportion oſ intensity with that oſ the sides oſ a parallelogram, ac- tually generate a third, which is the immediate cause oſ the motion in the diagona. An equivalent ſoree is not the same with a resulting ſorce. 48. Yet we see numherless cases oſ the composition ofſ incitements to motion, and they seem as determinate, and as susceptible oſ being comhined hy eomposition, as the things called moving forces, vhich are measured hy the velocities: we see them actuslly so comhined in a thousand instances, as in the example already given oſ a lighter dragged by two horses pulling in different directions. Nay, experiment shews, that this composition ſollows precisely the same rule as the composition oſ the ſorces which are measured by the velocities; ſor iſ the point A (fig. 1.) be pulled by a thread, or pressed by a spring, in the direction AB, and hy another in the direction AC, and if the pressures are proportional to AB and AC, then it will be withheld from moving, iſ it be pulled or pressed by a third force, acting in the direction Ad, opposite to AD, the pressure being also proportional to AD. This ſoree, acting in the direetion Ad, would eertainly withstand an equal ſorce acting in the direction AD; therefore we must conclude, that the two pressures AB and AC really generate a ſorce AD. This uniſorm agreement shews that the composition is deducible ſrom fixed principles; but it does not appear that it can he held as demonstrated by the arguments employed in the case oſ motions. A demonstration oſ the composition oſ pressures is still wanted, in order to render mechanics a demonstrative science. Aceordingly, philosophers oſ the ſirst eminence have turned their attention to this problem. It is hy no means easy ; being so nearly allied to first principles, that it must he diſficult to find axioms oſ greater simplicity by vhich it may be proved. Mechanicians generally contented themselves with the olution given by Aſislotle; but this is merely a composi- tion oſ motions: indeed he does not give it for any thing else, and calls it  46u r 9”a. The first writer who appears to have considered it as difſerent ſfrom the mere composition of motions, was the celebrated Dutch engineer Stevinus in his work on Stuices; but his solution is obscure. It was suſficient, however, to convince Daniel Bernoulli oſ the necessity and the diſficulty oſ the problem. He has given the first complete demonstration of it in the ſirst volume of the Commentaries of the Imperial Academy oſ Sciences at St Petersburgh. It is extremely ingenious; but it is tedious and intricate, requiring a series oſ fiſteen propositions to demonstrate that two pressures, having the directions and magnitudes oſ the sides oſ any parallelogram, compose a third, which has the direction and magnitude oſ its diagonal. His first proposition is, that tuo equal pressures, octing at right an&les, compose a third, in the direction of the diagonal of a square, and having to either of the other tuo the proportion of the diagonal of a square lo ils sides. Mr DAlembert has greatly simplified and improveà this demonstration, by beginning with a case that is selſevident; namely, If ihree equal forces are inclined to each other in equal angles of 120 degrees, any one of them will balance the combined action of the other two. Burely; ſor neither of them can prevail. Thereſore tuo equal forces, inclined in an angle of 120 degrees, produce a third, which has the direction and proportion oſ the diagonal of the rhombus; for this is equal and opposite to one of the three above mentionedl. He then demonstrates the same thing of two equal ſorces inclined in any angle; and by a series oſ eight propositions more, demonstrates the general theorem. This dissertation is in the Memoirs oſ the Academy at Paris ſor 1769. He improves it still farther in a subsequent memoir. Mr Riceati and Mr Fonsenex, in the Commentaries oſ the Academy oſ Turin, have given analytical demonstr- tions, which are also very ingenious and concise, bhut require acquaintance with the higher mathematiesThere is another very ingenious demonstration in the Journal des Strarans for June 1764, but too obscure for an elementary proposition. It is somewhat simplified by Belidor in his Ingenieur Frangois. Frisius, in his Cosmographia, has given one, which is perhaps the best oſ all those that are easily comprehended without an acquaintance with the higher mathematics: but we imagine that, although no one can doubt of the conclusion, it has not that intuitive evidence for every step oſ the process that seems necessary. 50. We here offer another, composed by blending together the methods oſf Bernoulli and DAlembert; and we imagine that no objection can he made to any step of it. We limit it entirely to pressures, and do not at all consider nor employ the motions which they may he supposed to produce. (A) Iſ two equal and opposite pressures or incitements to motion act at once on a material particle, it sufſers no change of motion; for iſ it yields in either direction by their joint action, onè of the pressures prevails, and they ure not equal. Equæl and opposite pressures are said To BALANCE each other; and such as balance must be esteemed equal and n) iv and b are two magnitudes oſ the same kind, poportional to the intensities oſ two pressures which act æ the same direction, then the magnitude a + b will meaare the intensity of the pressure, which is equivalent, md may be called equal, to the combined efſort of the sther two; for when we try to form a notion oſ pressure 5 a measurable magnitude, distinet ſrom motion or any her effect of it, we find bins that we can mensure it ssure. Nor have we any notion of a  su enoub l Dessure diierent from a prassure that is . -m he joint eſſort oſ two or three equal pres- sures. A pressure a is accounted triple oſ a pressure à, if it balances three pressures, each equal to b, aeting together. Thereſore, in all proportions which ean be expressed by numbers, we must acknowledge the legitimacy oſ this measurement; and it would surely be affectation to omit those which the mathematicians call incommensurable. In like manner, the magnitude a b must be acknowledged to measure that pressure which arises from the joint uction of two pressures a and b acting in opposite direotions, of which a is the greatest. (C) Let ABCD and Ab C (fig. A bottom of Plate I) be two rhombuses, which have the common diagonal AC. Let the angles BAb, DAd, be bisected by the straight lines AE and AF. Iſ there be drawn ſrom the points E and F the lines EG, EH, Fg, Fh, making equal angles on each side oſ EA and FA, and if Gę, HA be drawn, cutting the diagonal AC in I and L: then AI 4 AL will be greater or less than AQ, the half oſ AC, according as the angles GEH, g F h, are greater or less than GAH, gAh. Drav GH, gh, cutting AE AF, in O and o, and draw Oo, cutting AC in . Because the angles AEG and EAG are respectively equal to AEH and EAH, and AE is common to both triangles, the sides AG, GE are respectively equal to AH, HE, and GH is perpendicular to AE, and is bisected in O; fſor the same reason, g h is bisected in o. Thereſore the lines G5, Oo, H h, are parallel, and IL is hisected in K. Thereſore AI + AL is equal to twice AK. Moreover, iſ the angle GEH be greater than GAH, AO is greater than EO, and AK is greater than KQ. Therefore AI + AL is greater than AQ; and iſ the angle GEH be less than GAH, AI + AL is less than AQ. (O) Two equal pressures, acting in the directions AB and AC (fig. .), at right angles to each other, composæ a pressure in the direction AD, which hisects the right mgle; and its intensity is to the intensity oſ each oſ the coustituent pressures as the diagonal oſ a square is to one oſ the sides. It is evident, that the direction of the pressure, generated hy their joint action, will biseot the angle formed by their directions; because no reason can be as5igned ſor the direction inclining more to one side than to the other. In the next place, since a ſorce in the direction AD does, in ſact, arise ſfrom the joint action of the equal pressures AB and AC, the pressure AB may be conceived as arising ſrom the joint action of two equal ſorces similarly inclined and proportioned to it. Drav EAF perpeniicular to AD. One oſ these ſorces must be directed along AD, and the other along AE. In like manner, the pressure AC may arise ſrom the joint action of a pressurein the direction AD, and an equal pressure in the direction AF. It is also plain, that the pressures in the directions AE and AF, and the two pressures in the direction AD, must be all equal. And also, any one of them must have the same proportion to AB or to AC, that AB or AC has to the force in the direction AD, arising from their joint action. Thereſore, iſ it be said that AD does not measure the pressure arising ſrom the joint action of AB and AC, let A d, greater than AD, be its just measure, and make A d: AB=AB: A AB: Ae. Then Ag and Ae have the same inclination and proportion to AB that AB and AC have to A d. We determine, in like manner, two ſorces Aſ and A g as constituents oſf AC. Now A d is equivalent to AB and AC, and AB is equivalent to Ae and Ag; and AC is equivalent to Aſ and Ag. Thereſore Ad is equivalent to Ae, Af, Ag und AgBut (a) A and Af balance each other, or annihilate each others effect; and there remain only the two forces n pressures A 5, Ag. Thereſore (a) their measure is a magnitude equal to twice AZ. But if Ad be greater than the diagonal AD of the square, whose sides are AB and AC; then Ag must be less than AI, the side of the square whose diagonal is AB. But twice A⸗ is less than AD, and much less than A d. Thereſore the measure oſf the equivalent of AB and AC cannot be a line A d greater than AD. In like manner, it cannot be a line A) that is less than AD. Therefſore it must bę equal to AD, and the proposition is demonstrated. (E) Cor. Two equal forces AB, AC, acting at right angles, will be balanced by a foree AO, equal and opposite to AD, the diagonal of the square whose sides are AB and AC; for AO would halance AD, which is the equivalent of AB and AC. (F) Let AECF (fig. S.) be a rhombus, the acute angle of which EAF is half of a right anglee Two equal pressures, which have the directions and measures AE, AF, compose a pressure, having the direction and measure AC, which is the diagonal of the rhombus. TIt is evident, in the first place, that the compound force has the direetion AC, which bisects the angle EAF. If AC be not its just measure, let it be AP less than AC. Let ABCD be a square described on the same diagonal, and make AP: AQAE: AO=AVF: Ao. Drav KOG, Kog perpendicular to AE, AF; draw GIg, OH o, EG, EK, Fę, FK, PF, and PE. i The angles CAB and FAE are equal, each being half of a right anglee. Also the figures AEPF and AGEK are similar, because AP: AQ = AE: AO. Therefore FA: AP  KA: AE, and EA: AP  GA: AE. Therefore, in the same manner that the forces AE, AF are affirmed to compose AP, the forces AG and AK may compose the ſoree AE, and the ſorces Aę and AK may compose the force AF. Thereſore (B) the force AP is equivalent to the four ſorces AG, AK, Ag, AK. But (D) AG aud A” are the sides oſ a square, whose diagonal is equal to twite AI: and the two forces AK, AX are equal to, or are measured hy, twice AK. Thereſore the four forces AG, AK, Ag, AK, are equivalent to 2 AI2 AE, æ4 AE. But because AP was supposed less than AC, the angle FPE is greater than FAE, and GEK is greater than GAE, AO is greater than OE, and AH is greater than HQ, and 2 AH is greater than AQ; and thereſore 4 AH is greater than AC, and much greater than AP. Thereſore AP is not the just measure oſ the ſorce composed oſf AE and AF. In like manner, it is shewn, that AE and AF do not compose a force whose measure is greater than AC. It is thereſore equal lo AC; and the proposition is demonstrated. (G) By the same process it may be demonstrated, that if BAD be halſ a right angle, and EAF be the ſourth of a right angle, two ſorces AE, AF will compose a force measured by AC. And the process may be repeated for a rhombus whose acute angle is ;th, ,th, &c. of a right angle; that is, any portion of a right angle that is produced by continual bisectionn. Two ſorces, forming the sides oſ such a rhombus, compose a ſorce measured by the diagonal. (H) Let ABCD, Abed (fig. 4) he two rhombuses ſormed by two consecutive bisections oſ a right angle. Let AECF be another rhombus, whose sides AE and AF bisect the angles BA b and DA d. The two ſorces AE, AF, compose a ſorce AC. Biseet AE and AF in O and o. Braw the perpendiculars GOH, g o h, and the lines GIg, OKo, HL h, and the lines EG, EH, F g, F h It is evident, that AGEH and Ag F h are rhombuses; because AOæ OE, and Ao = o F. It is also plain, that since b A d is half of BAD, the angle GAII is halſoſ b A d. It is therefore ſormed by a continual bisection oſ a right angle. Thereſore (G) the forees AG, AH, eompose a ſorce AE; and A g, A h, compose the force AF. Therefore the ſorces AG, AH, Ag, Ah, acting together, are equivalent to the ſorces AE, AF acting together. But AG, Ag compose a ſoree  AI; and the forces AH, A h compose a force 2 AL. Thereſore the ſour ſorees neting together are equivalent to 2 AI42 AL, or to 4 AE. But hecause AO is  AE and the lines G g, Oo, H h, ure evidently parallel, 4 AK is equal to 2 AQ, or to AC; and the proposition is demonstrated. I) Cor. Let us now suppose, that by continual biseetion oſ a right angle we have obtained a very small angle a oſ a rhombus; and let us name the rhombus by the multiple oſ a whieh ſorms its acute angle. Thę proposition (G) is true oſ a, 2 a, 4 a, &e. The proposition (H) is true of 3 a. In like manner, because G) is true of 4 o and 5 a, proposition (H) is true of õ a; and because it is true oſ 4 a, 6 a, and 8 a; it is true of 5 a and 7 a. And 50 on continually till we have demonstrated it oſ every multiple oſ a that is less than a right angle. ) Let RAS (fig. 5) he perpendieular to AC, and ABCD be a rhombus, whose acute angle BAD is some multiple oſ 2 a that is less than a right angle. Let Ab C d be another rhombus, whose sides A b, A d biseet the angles RAB, SAD. Then the forces Ab, Ad compose a force AC. Drav b R, d S parallel to BA, DA. It is evident, that AR b B and AS d D are rhomhuses, vhose aeute angles are multiples oſ a, that are each less thun a right angle: Therefore (I) the forces AR and AB compose the ſorce Ab, and AS, AD compose A d; but AR and AS amihilute each other's efſect, and there remains only the forces AB, AD. Thereſore Ab and A d are equivalent to AB and AD, which compose the ſforee AC; and the proposition is demonstrated. ) Cor. Thus ĩs the corollary of lust proposition extended to every rhombus, whose angle at A is some multiple oſ a less than two right angles And since a may he taken less than any angle that can be named, the proposition may be considered as demonstrated oſ every rhombus: and we may sa5, OI) Tuo equal forces, inclined to each other in any ungle, compose au fſorce which is measured by the diagonal of the rhombus, whos sides are the measures of the constiluent fortes. ) Two ſorces AB, AC ſſig. 6.), having the direotion and proportion oſ the sides oſ a rectangle, compose a ſorce AD, having the direction and proportion oſ the diaDraw the other diagonal CB, and drawv EAF parallel to ĩt; draw BE, CF parallel to DA. AERBG is a rhombus; and thereſore the ſorces AE and AG eompose the foree AB. AFCG is also a rhombus, and the force AC ĩs equivalent to AF and AG. Therefore the forces AB and AC, acting together, are equivalent to the forces AE, AV, AG, and AG acting together, or to AE, AF, and AD acting together: But AE and AP unnihilate each other's action, being opposite and equal (for each is equal to the halſ of BC). Thereſore AB and AC æcting together, are equivalent to AD, or compose the force AD. O) Tvo ſorces, which have the direction and proportions of AB, AC (fig. 7.) the sides of any purallelogram, compose a ſoree, having the direction and proportion oſ the dingonal AD Draw AF perpendicular to BD, and BG and DE perpendieular to AC. Then AFBG is a rectangle, as is also APDE; and AG is equal to CE. Thereſore (N) AB is equivalent to AF and AG. Therefore AB and AC acting together, ae equivalent to AF, AG, and AC acting together; that is, to AF and AE acting together; that is (N) to AD; or the forees AB and AC compose the ſorce AD. Hence arises the most general proposition, . 5l. If a material porticle be urged at once by two pressures or incitements to motion, whose intensities are proportioned to the sides of any purallelogram, and which act in the directions of those sides, it is affected in the sume manner as if it were octed on by a single force, whose intensily is meusured by the diagonal of the porallelogram, and which acts in ils direclion: Or, two pressures, having the direction and proportion of the sides of a parollelogram, generate a pressure, having the direttion and proportion of the diagonal. Thus have we endeavoured to demonstrate ſrom ahstract principles the perſect similarity oſ the composition oſ pressures, and the composition oſ forees measured by the motions which they producee We cannot help being oſ the opinion, that a separate demonstration is indispensably necessary What may be ſairly deduced from the one case, cannot always be applied to the other. No composition oſ pressures can explain the change produced by a deſlecting force on a motion already existing; for the changing pressure is the only one that exists, and there is none to be compounded with it. And, on the other hand, our notions and ohservations oſ the composition of motions will not explain the composition oſ pressures, unless we take it for granted that the pressures are proportional to the velocities; but this is perhaps a gratuitous assumption. At any rate, it is not an intuitive proposition; and-we have mentioned some facts where it seems that they do not follow the same proportion. The pressure oſ ſour equal springs produces only a double velocity. It would appear, thereſore, that there are circumstanees which oblige us to say, that the exertion of pressure, as a cause of motion, is not (always at least) proportional to the real measurable pressuree We are thereſore anxious to disco2 ver in what the difference consists; and in the mean time must allow, that the pressure exerted on a body at rest is different ſrom its exertion in producing motion We cannot indeed state any immediate comparison bet ween pressure and motion, nor have we any clenr conception of the connection between them. It is only by our sensations oſ touch that we have any notion of pressure, and it is experience that teaches us that it always accompanies every cause oſ motion We can, however, observe the proportions of pressures, and compare them with the proportions oſ motionn. We very oſten observe them diſſerent; and thereſore it was indispensably necessary to investigate the laws oſ eomhined pressure as we did the laws of comhined motion in consequence oſ pressuree Yet we should err, iſ we hastily asserted that pressures are not proportional to the motions which they produce; all that we are entitled to call in doubt is, whether the pressures in their exertion, while they actually produce motion, or ehanges oſ motion, continue to be the same as when they do not produce motion, being withstood or balanced by opposite pressures. Considered as causes oſ motion, we ought to think that they do not vary while they produce motion, and that the actual pressure; while it produces a double motion, is really double, although it may be quadruple when the body exerting it is made to act on a body that it cannot move. We are confirmed in this opinion by observing, that other ſacts shew us, that even while producing motion, the pressure which we call quadruple, because we have measured it by four equal pressures balancing it, is really quadruple, considered as the cause oſ motion, and produces a quadruple motion. A bow which requires ſour times the ſorce to draw it to any given extent, vill ecommunicate the same velocity to a bundle of ſour arrows that a how ſour times easier drawn communicates to ne arrow, and will therefore produce a quadruple motion. et it will only produce a double velocity in the arrow roL. I E that acquired a simple veloeity from a bow having onefourth oſ the strength. These discrepancies should excite the endeavours of mechanicians to investigute the laws observed in the action oſ pressures in producing motionn. Had this been done with eare and with candour, we should not have had the great diſſerenee oſ opinion, which still divides philosophers, about the measures of moving foreess But a spirit of purty, which hud arisen ſrom other causes, gave importance to what was at first only a difference oſ expression, and made the partisans of Mr Leibnitæ avail themselves oſ the figurative language which has done so much harm in all the departments oſ philosophy. Notwithstanding all our caution, it is hardly possible to avoid metaphorical conceptions when we employ the language of metaphor. The abettors oſ the Leibnitzian measure of moving forces, or perhaps, to speak more properly, the ubettors of the Leibnitian measure of that force which is supposed to preserve bodies in their condition oſ motion insist, that the foree which is exerted in producing any change oſ motion is greater in proportion as the motion changed is greater: and they give a very specious argument ſor their asertion. They appeal to the exertions which we ourselves makee. Here we are conscious of the fact. Then they give similar examples oſ the action oſ bodies. A clay bull, moving six feet per second, will make the addition oſ one foot to the velocity of an equal clay ball that is already moving ſour feet per second in the same directionn. But iſ this last ball he already moving ten feet per second, we must follow it with a velocity oſ twelve ſeet in order to increase its velocity one ſoot. But, without insisting on the numberless paralogisms and inconsistencies which this way oſ conceiving the matter would lead us into, it suffices to observe, that the phenomena give us abundant assurance that there has been the same exertion in both these cases. This acceleration is always aceompanied hy a compression oſ the halls, and the compression is the same in both. This compression is a very good measure of the force employed to producæè it; and in the present case, we need not even trouble oursælves with any rule ſor its measurement: for surely when the compression is not different, but the same, the ſorcè exerted is the same. This is ſarther confirmed by observing, that it requires the same foree to make the same pit, or to give the same motion, to a piece oſ clay lying on the tzble of a ships cahin, whether the ship be sailing two miles or ten miles per hour: Thus we see that there are strong reasons for helieving, that the exertions oſ pressure in producing motion, or that the pressures actually exerted, are proportional to the changes oſ motion observed, and that they eoincide in this respect with our ahstract conceptions of moving forces. But we have still better arguments: None oſ the Leibnitzians think of denying the equal exertions of gravity, or oſ any oſ those powers which they eall slicitations or uecelerating forcexs They all admit, that gravity, or any constant accelerating ſoree; produces equal increments oſ velocĩty in equal times, and that a double gravity will produce a double inerement in an equal time; and an equal inerement in halſ oſ the time; and that a quadruple gravity will produce a double velocity in halſ the time: All these things are granted hy them, aund their writings are full of reasonings ſrom this prineiple Now from the fact, acknowledged by the Leibnitzians, that the quadruple force of a hiow gives a double velocity to the arrow, in every instant oſ its action, it indisputably ſollows, that it has acted on it only for half the time oſ the action of the four times weaker how, which gives the ãrrow only hilf the velocity ; and thus has the discrepaney hetween the eſſects oſ pressures and oſ our abstract moving ſurees entirely disappeared. For this circumstance oſ the difſerence in thæ 1imæ oſ acting will be ſound, on striet exami- nation, in all the eases oſ the change oſ motion by pressures which we measure by their efſfects on a body at rest. When this and the appreciable changes oſ actual pressure, during the time oſ producing the motion, are taken into consideration, all difſference vanishes, and the composition of pressures is in perſect harmony with the composition oſ motions, or of abstract moving forcess DvNamics is thus made a demonstrative science, and affords the opportunity oſ investigating, by observation and experiment, the nature of those mechanical powers which reside in bodies, and which appear to us under the form of pressure, inducing us to consider pressure as a cause oſ motion. In this, however, we are rather inaccurate. Pressure is one oſ the sensible effects oſ that property which is also the cause of motionn It is not the pressure of a piece of lIead, but its heaviness, which is the reason that it gives motion to a kitehen jack. Pressure is merely a generie name, borrowed ſrom a ſamiliar instance, and given to moving forces, which have the same nature, but different names that serve to mark their connection with certain substances, in which they may be supposed to residee Natural philosophy is almost entirely employed in examining the nmature of these various pressures or accelerative forces; and the general doctrines of dynamics, by ascertaining what is common to them all, enable us to mark with precision what is characteristic of each. 53. We have now advanced very ſar in this investigation; for we have obtained the criterion by which we learn the direction and the magnitude oſ every changing force: and, on the other hand, we see how to state what will be the effect oſ the exerſion of any force that is known or suspected to act. All this we learn by the composition of ſorces; and the greatest part of mechanical disquisition consists in the application oſ this doctrine. For such reas0ns it merits minute consideration; and thereſore we must point out some general conclusions ſrom the properties oſ figure, which will greatly ſacilitate the use oſ the parallelogram of forces. 5:2 Ilst. The constituent and the resulting ſorces, or the simple and compound ſorces, act in the same plane; for the sides and diagonal oſ a parallelogram are in one plane. 55. 2l. The simple and the compound forces are proportional to the sides of any triangle which are parallel to their directions. For iſ any three lines, ab, hd, ad, he drawn perallel to AB, AC, and AD (fig 7, No. 2.), they uill ſorm a triangle similar to the triangle ABD. For the same reasons they are proportional to the sides oſ a triangle a't'd, which are respectively perpendicular to their directions. : 56. 3d. Thereſore each is proportional to the sine of the opposite angle oſ this triangle; ſor the sides oſ any triangle are proportional to the sines oſ the opposite anes. : 57. 4h, Each is proportional to the sine oſ the angle contained by the directions oſ the other two; ſor AD is to AB as the sine oſ the angle ABD to the sine oſ the angle ADB. Now the sine of ABD is the same with the sine of BAC contained between the directions AB and AC, and the sine of ADB is the same with the sine of CAD; also AB is to AC, or BD, as the sine of ADB (or CAD) to the sine of BAD. 58. We now proceed to the application oſ this ſundamental propositionn. And we observe, in the first place, that since AD may be the diagonal of an indefinite number oſ parallelograms, the motion or the pressure AD may result ſrom the joint action of many pairs oſ forcess It may be produced by forees whieh would separately produce the motions AF and AG. This generally gives us he means of discovering the forces which concur in its roduction. If one of them, AB, is known in direction and itensity, the direction AC, parallel to BD, and the intensity, are discoveredl. Sometimes we know the directions of hoth. Then, by drawing the parallelogram or triangle, we learn their proportionss The ſorce which deflects any motion AB into a motion AD, is hail hy simply drawing a line ſfrom the point B (to which the body would have moved ſrom A in the time of really moving ſrom A to D) to the point D. The deſlecting ſorce is such as would have caused the hody to move ſfrom B to D in the same time, And, in the same mauner, ve get the compound motion AD, which arises from any two simple motions AB and AC, hy supposing both oſ the motions to be aceomplished in suecession. The final place of the body is the same, whether it moves along AD or along AB and BD in succession. 59. This theorem is not limited to the composition oſ two motions or two ſorces only; ſor since the combined action oſ two forces puts the hody into the same state as iſ their equivalent alone had acted on it, ve may suppose this to huve been the case, ànd then the action of a third force will produce a change on this equivalent motion. The resulting motion will be the same as iſ only this third ſTorce and the equivalent oſ the other two had acted on the body. Thus, in plate I. fig. 6. the three ſorces AB, AC, AE, may act at once on a particle oſ matter. Complete the parallelogram ABDC; the diagonal AD is the force which is generated by AB and AC. Complete the parallelogram AEFD; the diagonal AF is the force resulting from the combined action of the forces AB, AC, and AE. In like manner, completing the parallelogram AGHF, the diagonal AH is the force resulting from the combined action of AB, AC, AE, and AG, and so on of any number oſ forces. This resulting ſorce and the resulting motion may be much more expeditiously determined, in any degree of composition, by drawing lines in the proportion and di- rection oſ the ſorces in succession, each ſrom the end oſ the preceding. Thus, draw AB, BD, DF, FH, and join AH; AH is the resulting ſoreee The demonstration is evident. 60. It is to he notioed here, that in the composition of more than two forces, ve are not limited to one plane. The ſoree AD is in the same plane with AB and AC; but AE may he elevated above this plane, and AG may lead helow itt. AF is in the plane of AD and AE, and AH is in the plane of AF and AG. Complete the parallelograms ABLE, ACKE, ELFK. It is evident that ABLFKCD is a parallelopiped, and that AF ĩs one oſ its diagonals. Hence we derive a more general theorem oſ great use. Three forces having the proportion and direction of the three sides of a purollelopiped, eompose a force having he proportion and direction of the diagonal. 61. Any number oſ fſorees neting together on one particle of matter are balanced by a ſorce that is equal and opposite to their resulting foree; ſor this force would haIance their resulting force which is equivalent to them in action. When this is duly considered, we pereeive that each ſorce is then in equilibrio with the equivalent oſ all the others; ſor a ſoree ean balance only what is equal and opposite to it. It appears very readily by the geometrical construetion. Iſ, instead of the circuit A, B, D, VF, H, we take B, D, F, H, A, we have BA ſor the equivaleut oſ the ſorces AC. AE, AG; hut AB isequal and opposite to BA. ſherefore the force AB is in equilibrio with: the æquivalent oſ all the others. 62. When any number oſ ſorees act on one particle oſ matter, and are in equilibrio, iſ they be considered as neting in parcels, the equivalents oſ these parcels are in equilibrio; ſor let the ſorcos AB, AC, AE, AG, Al, be in equilibrio, and let them be considered in the two parcels AB, AC, and AE, AG, Ah; then AD is the equivalent of AB, BD (or AC), and DA is the equivalent of DF, FH, HA (or Ah): now AD and DA balance each other. This corollary enables us to simpliſy many intricate complications oſ force; it also enables us to draw accurate conclusionssſrom very imperfect observations. In most of our practieal discussions ve know, or at least we attend to, a part only of the forces which are acting on a material partiele; and in such cases we reason as if we saw the whole: yet is our mathematical reasoning good with respect to the equivalent oſ all the parcels whieh we are contemplating, and the equivalents oſ the smaller parcels of which it cunsists; and the neglected force, or parcel oſ forces, induces no error on our conclusions. 63. In the spontaneous phenomena oſ nature, the investigation and discovery oſ our ultimate object of search is frequently very difficult, on account oſ the multiplicity oſ directions and intensities of the operating forces or motions. We may generally facilitate the process, by substituting equivalent forces or motions acting in convenient directions. It is in this way that the navigator computes the ships place with very little trouble, by substituting equivalent motions in the meridional and equatorial directions for the real oblique courses oſ the ship. Instead of setting down ten miles on a course, S. 86. 52. W. he supposes that the ship has sailed eight miles due south, and six miles due west, which brings her near to the same place. Then, instead of ſourteen miles south-west, he sets down ten miles south and ten miles west; and he proceeds in the same way ſor every other eourse and distance. He does this expeditiously by means of a traverse table, in which are ready calculated the meridional and equatorial sides of right angled triangles, corresponding to every course and distancee Having done this for the eourse of a whole day, he adds all the southings into one sum, and all the westings into another: he considers these as forming the sides oſ a right angled triangle; he looks for them, puired together, in his traverse table, and then notices vhat angle and what distance corresponds to this pair This gives him the position and magnitude oſ the straight Iine joining the beginning and end oſ his doys work. The miner proceeds in the same way when he takes the plan of subterruaneous workings, measuring, as he goes along, and notiting the bearing oſ each line by the compass, and setting down, from his traverse table, the northing or southing, and the easting or westing, ſor each oblique line: but there is another circumstance whieh he must attend to, namely, the slope of the various driſis, galleries, and other workings. This he does by noting the rise or the dip oſ each sloping linee. He adds all these into two sums, and taking the risings from the dips, he obtains the whole dij. Thus he learns how ſar the workings proceed to the north, how far to the east, and how ſar to the dip. The reſlecting reader will pereeive, that the line joining the two extremities oſ this progression will ſorm the diagonal oſ a reetangular parallelopiped; one oſ whose sides lies north and south, the other lies east and west, and the third is right up and down. The mechanician proceeds in the very same way in the investigation oſ the very complicated phenomena which ſrequently engage his attentionn. He considers every motion as compounded of three motions in some convenient directions, at right angles to ench other. He also considers every foree as resulting ſrom the joint action oſ three forces, at right angles to each other, and takes the sum or diſſerence oſ these in the same or onposite directions. From this process he obtains the three sides oſ a purallelopiped, and ſrom these computes the position and magnitude of the diagona. This is the motion or ſorce resulting from the composition oſ all the partial ones. This procedure is called the Estinarion or REDUCTION of motions and ſorces. : 64. A motion or foree AB (fig. 9.) is said to be estimated in the direction EF, or to be reduced to this direction when it is conceived as compounded oſ the motions or forces AC, AD, one oſ which AC is parallel to EF, and the other AD is perpendicular to it. This expression is abundantly significant; ſor it is plain that the motion AD neither promotes nor hinders the progress along EF, and that AC expresses the whole progress in this direction. 65. In like manner, a ſoree AB (fig: 10.) is said to be estimuted in, or reduced to, a given plane EFGH, when it is conceived as resulting from the joint ãction of two forces AC, AD, one of which is parallel to a line a b drawvn in that plane, and the other AD is perpendicular to it. The position oſ the line a b is determined by letting ſall B b perpendieular to the plane, and drawing b P to the point P, in which BA meets the plane; then A a being drawn parallel to B b, will cut ofſf b a, which is the reduction of the motion AB to the plane. Drawing AC parallel to a b, and completing the parallelogram ACBD, it is evident that the motion AB is equivalent to AD and AC, which is parallel to ab, and the three forces AB, AC, AD, are, as they should be, in one plane perpendicular to the plane EG. 66. Iſ three forces AB, AC, AD, (ſig. 1l.), are in equilibrio, and are reduced to any one direction d Al, or to one plane EFGH, the reduced ſorces are also in equilibrio. First, Let them he reduced to one direction dl by drawing the perpendiculars B b, Ce, D d; make AL equal to AD, and join BL, CL, and draw the perpendiculars Li, Cc; then, because the ſorces AB, AC, AD, are in equilibrio, ABLC must be a parallelogram, and AL is the ſorce equivalent to AB and AC combined; then, because the lines D d, Bb, Cc, L, are parallel, d A is equal to Al, and Ab to Co, or to cl; thereſore Al is equal to the sum oſ Ab and Ac, which are the reduotions oſ AB md AC; thereſore d A is equal to the same sum, and in equilibrio with them. Secondly, Let them be reduced to one plane EFGH, and let æ 8, æ æ, æ 3, be the reduced forcess The lines D), Aæ BS, Cæ, L are all parallel, heing perpendicular to the plane; thereſore the planes AB à and CL a are parallel, and æ8, æ), are parallel. For similar reasons, B2, ax, are parallel; chereſore uãræ is a parallelogram. Also, because the lines D3, A æ, L), are parallel, and DA is equal to AL; thereſore 3æ is equal to a2. But because æ is a purallelogram, the forces æ⸗, ææ, are equivalent to ; and æ is equal and opposite to æa, and will bulaneæ it; and therefore will balance æ3 and ææ, which are the reductions of AB and AC to the planée EFGH, while æà is the reduction of AD; thereſore the proposition is demonstrated. The most usual and the most useful mode oſ reduction, is to estimate all ſorces in the directions oſ ſhree lines drawn from one point, at right angles to each other, like the three plane angles oſ a rectungular chest, ſorming the length, the breadth, and the depth oſ the chest. These are commonly called the three co-ordinates The resulting ſorce will be the diagonal oſ this parallelopiped. This process occurs in all disquisitions in which the mutual action oſ solids and ſluids is considered, and when the oscillation or rotation oſ detached ſree bodies is the subject oſ discussion. 67. The only other general theorem that remains ſo be dedueed ſrom ihis law oſf motion is, that iſ a number of bodies are moving in any manner whatever, and an equal ſorce act on every particle oſ matter in the same or parallel directions, their relative motions will suffer no change; ſor the motion of any body A (ſig 12) relutive to another body B, which is also in motion, is compounded oſ the real motion oſ A, and the opposite o the real motion of B; ſer let A move uniſormly from A to C, while B de- scribes BD uniſormly, draw AB, also draw AE equal and parallel to BD, join EC, DC, ED. The motion of A, relative to B, consists in its change of position and distancee. Had A deseribed AE, while B described BD, there would have been no change oſ relative place or distance; but A is now at C, and DC is its new direction and distancee The relative or apparent motion of A therefore is EC. Complete the parallelogram ACFE; it is plain that the motion EC is compounded oſ EF, which is equal and parallel to AC, the real motion oſ A, and oſ EA, the equal and opposite to BD, the real motion oſ B. Now let the motions oſf A and B sustain the same change; let the equal and parallel motions AG, BH, be compounded with the motions AC and BD; or let forces act at once on A and B, in the parallel directions AG, BH, and with equal intensities; in either supposition, the resulting motions will be Ac, B d, the diagonals of the parallelograms A G e C, and B H àd D. Construct the figure as beſore, and we see that the relative motion is now  c, and ſhat it is the same with EC both in respect oſ magnitude and position. Here we still see the constant analogy between the composition of motions and the composition oſ forces. In the first case, the relative motions of things are not changed, whatever common motion he compounded with them all; or, as it is usually, but inaceurately, expressed, although the space in which they move be earried along with any motion whatever. In the second case, the relative motions and actions are not ehanged by any external ſorce, however great, when equally exerted on every purticle in parallel directions: Thus it is that the evolutions oſ a ſleet in a uniſorm current are the same, and produeed by the same means, as in still waterr. Thus it is that we walk about on the surface oſ this globe in the same manner as iſ it neither r- volved round the sun, nor turned round its axis Thus it is that the same strength of a how will communicate a certain velocity to an arrow, whether it is shot east, or west, or north, or south. Thus it is that the mutual actions of sublunary bodies are the same, in whatever directions they are exerted, and notwithstanding the very great changes in their velocities by reason oſ the earth's rotation and orbital revolutionn. The real velocity oſ a hody on the earths equator is about 3000 feet per second greater at midnight than at midday For at midnight the motion oſ rotation nearly conspires with the orbital motion, and at midday it nearly opposes it. The difſerence between the velocities at the beginning oſ January and the beginning oſ July is vastly greater And at other times oſ the day, and other seasons oſ the year, both motions oſ the earth are transversely compounded with the easterly or westerly motion oſ an arrow or cannon hullet. Yet we ean observe no chſhige in the eſſeets oſ the mutual actions of bodies. 68. This is an important observation; because it proves that forces are to he measured hy no other seale than by the motions which they produce We have had repeated occasions to mention the very difſerent estimation oſ moving ſorces by Mr Leihnitæ; and have shewn how, by a very partial consideration oſ the action oſ those natural powers called pressures, he has attempted to prove, that moving ſorces are proportional to the squares oſ the velocities; and we shewed brieſly, in what manner a right consideration of what passes when motion is produced by measurable pressures, proves that the forces really exerted are as the velocities produced But the most copious prooſ is had ſrom the present observation, that, in ſact, the mutual actions oſ hodies depend on their relative moLions alone. 69. The Leibnitæian measure oſ moving foree is altogether incompatible with the universal ſact now mention- ed, viz. that the relative motions oſ bodies, resulting ſrom their mutual actions, are not aſfected by any common motion, or the action oſ any equal and parallel ſorce on bothi bodies: for this universal faet imports, that when two bodies are moving with equal velocities in the same direetion, a force applied to one of them, s0 as to increase its velocity, gives it the same motion relative to the other, as if both hodies had been at rest. Here it is plain, that the space described by the hody in consequence of the primitive ſorce, and oſ the ſorce now added, is the sum of the spaces which each oſ them would generate in a body at rest. Thereſore the ſorees are proportional to the velocities or changes oſ motion which they produce, and not to the squares oſ those velocities. This measure of forces, or the position that a force makes the same change on any velocity whatever, and the independence oſ the relative motions on any motion that i3 the same ortll the bodies oſ a system, are counterparts oſ each other. Sinee this independence is a matter oſ observation in all terrestrial bodies, we are entitled to say, that the powers which the Author of Nature has imparted to natural bodies are no vay different ſfrom what are eompetent to matter once called into existencee And it also ſollows from this, that ve must always remain ignorant oſ the absolute motions oſ hodies. The fact, that it has required the unremitted study of ages to discover even the relative motions of ouæ solar system, is an argument to prove that the inſluence of this mechanical principle extends ſar beyond the limits of this sublunary world; nor has any phenomenon yet been exhibited which should lead us to imagine that it is not universal. l When we have made use oſ these arguments with some zealous partizans oſ Mr Leibnitæ's doetrine, they have answered, that iſ indeed this independence oſ the relative motions of terrestrial hodies were observed to obtain exactly, it would be a conclusive argument. But the mo- tion with which all is carried along is so great in comporison with the motions which we can produee in our experiments, that the small additions or diminutions that we can make to the veloeity oſ this common motion must ohserve very neurly the proportions oſ the additions or diminutions oſ their squaress The difſerences of the squares of 2, 3S, and 4, are very unequal; hut the diſferences of the squares oſ 9, 10, Il, are mueh nearer to the ratio of equality; and the difference oſ the squares of 1000001, 1000002, 1000003, do not sensibly deviate from this ratio. But it is not ſact that we eannot produee motions which have a very sensible proportion to the common motion. The motion of a cannon hall, discharged with one- third of its weight oſ powder, is nearly equal to that oſ the rotation of the earth's equator When, thereſore, we discharge the ball eastward, we double its motion; when to the westward, we destroy it. Thereſore, aceording to Leibnitæ, the action in the first case is three times the action in the second. In the ſirst case it changes the square oſ the velocity (which we may call 1) from I to 4; and, in the second, it changes it ſrom I to O. But say the Leibnitzians, the velocity of rotation is but, of the orhital velocity of the earth, and our observations oſ the velocities oſ eannon hullets are not suſficiently exact to ensure us against an error of m But the latter observations on the peculiar motions oſ the fixed stars concur in shewing, that the sun, with his attending planets, are carried along with a very great motion, which, in all probability, has a sensible ratio to the orbital motion oſ the earth. This must make a prodigious change on the earths ahsolute motion, according as her orbital motion conspires with, opposes, or crosses, this other motion: the earth may even be at absolute rest in some points of its orbit. Thus will the composition with the motions produced in our exteriments be so varied, that cuses must oceur when the diſference oſ the results oſ the two measures of ſoree will be very sensible. But, ſarther, they have not attended to the agreement oſ our experiments, vhen the discharges oſ cannon are made in a direction transverse to that oſ the common motion. Here the immensity of the common motion, and the minuteness of our experimental velocities, can have no eſfeet in diminishing the diſſerence oſ the results oſ the two doctrines. This will appear distinctly to every reader who is much conversant in disquisitions of this kind; and it is in these more moderate motions that the complete independence oſ the relative motions on the common motions most accurately appears. Pendulum elocks and vatches have been oſten executed which do not deviate ſrom perſect equability oſ motion one part in 56300. This could not be obtained in all directions oſ the oscillations, if the ſorces deviated ſrom the ratio oſ the velocities one part in 86400.  On the whole, we may consider it as established on the surest foundation, that the action oſ those powers of natural bodies which we call pressures, such as the ſorce oſ springs, the exertions oſ animals, the coliesion of hodies, as vell as the action oſ those other incitements to motion which we eall altractions and repulsions, sueh as gravitation, magnetism, and electricityis proportional to the change oſ velocity produeed by it. And we must observe here, that this is not a mere mode oſ eonception, the result of the laws oſ human thought, which cannot econceive a notural power as the eause of motion otherwise than by its producing motion, and which cannot conceive any degree of moring power diſſerent ſfrom the degree oſ the motion. This is the ahstract doctrine; and it is true whether the pressures are proportional Lo the velocities or to the squares of the velocities. But we see ſorther, that whatever is the pressure of a spring (ſor example) on a quiescent body, yet the pressure actually exerted in producing a double 2 velocity is only double, and not quadruple, as our ſirst imperſect observations make us imagine. 70. Sir Isasc Newton has added another proposition to the number of laws 6ſ motion; numely, that every action is aceompanied by an equãl and eontrary reaclionn. But in aſſirming this to be a law oſ nature, he only means that it is an universal ſaet: And he makes this aſfirmation on the authority oſ what he eonceives to be a law oſf human thought; namely, that those qualities whieh we find in all bodies on which we can make experiments and observations, are ſo be considered as universal qualities of body. But we have limited the term low of motion to those eonseqquences that necessurily ſlow ſrom our notions oſ motion, oſ the causes oſ its production and changes. Now this third Newtonian proposition is not sueh a result. A magnet is æaid to act on a piece oſ iron when, and only when, the vicinity oſ the magnet is observed to he accompunied by certain motions of the iron. But it by no means ſollows ſfrom this ohservation, that the presence of the iron shall he accompanied hy any motion, or any change oſ state whatever oſ the magnet, or any appearance that can suggest the notion that the iron acts on the magnet. When this was observed, it was accounted a discovery. Newton discovered, that the sun acts on the planets, and ihat the earth acts on the moon; and Kepler dizeovered, that the moon reacts on the earth. Newton hæd observei, that the iron reacts on the magnet; that the actions of electrified hodies were mutual; and that every getion oſ sublunary hodies was, in fact, accompanied by an equal and contrary reactionn. On the authority oſ his rule oſ philosophi7ing, he aſſirmed, that the planeis react on the sun, and ſhat the sun is not at rest, but is conſinually agitated by a small motion round the general centre of gravitation. He pointed out several consequences oſ this ractionn. Astronomers examined the eelestial motions ore narrowly, and ſound that those consequences do ror. I- r really obtain, qud disturb all the planetary motions. Tt ĩs now ſound that this reciprocity oſ action obtains throughout the solar system with the utmost precision, and that the third Newtonian proposition is really a law oſ nature, although it is not a law oſ human thought. It is a discovery. The contrary involves no absurdity or contradiction. It would indeed be contrary to experience; but things might have been otherwise. It is conceivable, and possible, that a ball A shall strike another equal ball B, and carry it along with it, without any diminution of its velocity. The ſact, that the velocity oſ A is reduced to one-half, is the indication of a ſorce residing in B, which ſorce changes the motion of A; and the intensity oſ this foree is learned ſrom the change which it produces. This is ſound to be equal to the change produced hy A on B, and thus the reaction oſ B is discovered to be equal to the action of A. It is highly probable, that this universality and equality oſ reaction to action is the consequence oſ some general principle, which we may in time discover; meanwhile we are entitled to suppose it universal, and to reason ſrom this topic in our disquisitions about the actions oſ hodies on each other. TuesE propositions might have completed the doetrines of dynamies; but it appears that, in order to the produetion of a material universe which should accomplish the purposes oſ the Creator, it was necessary that there he certain characteristic diſſerences between the ſorces inherent in the various collections oſ matter which compose this universee The ſacts or physical laws (ſor the abovementioned laws are metaphysical) of motion may be diſſerent ſrom those which would have heen observed had matter been leſt entirely to itsell. This diſſerence may have introduced other laws oſ motion as necessarily resulting ſrom the nature oſ the ſorcess We have occasion- illy mentioned some instances where this appears to obtain, but gave good reasons ſor aſfirming, that a due examination of all cireumstances which may be observed in the production or variation oſ motion by those forces, has demonstrated, that there are no sueh deviations ſfrom the two laws oſ motion already determined, but that all the mechanical powers oſ hodies, when considered merely as tauses of motion, act agreeably to the same laws. Careſul examination was, however, saidto be necessary. This examination must consist in distinctly noticing the circumstances that occur in the production of motion by any ſorce whatever. It is by no means enough to state simply the intensity oſ the force and the direction oſ its exertion. If a force continue to act, it continues to vary the motion already produced. Should the force change ils intensity or direction while it is acting, these circumstances must induce still ſarther changes in the motion; and it ĩs not till all action has ceased that the motion is brought to its ostensible state, in which it is the ohject of our attention and our future discussions. Instances oſ the eſſects oſ such continued and such varied actions are to be seen in most of the phenomena oſ nature or art. The communication oſ motion by impulse is perhaps the only instance (very ſrequent indeed) that can be produced vhere this is not necessary: Nay, we shall perhaps ſind reason to conclude, that this instance is not an exception, ud that even the communication of motion ſrom one hilliard hall to another is brought about by an action continued for some time, andęgreatly varied during that time. Much preparation is thereſore necessary beſore we can apply the general laws oſ motion to the solution of most of the questions which eome heſore us in the course even oſ our elementary disquisitions. We must lay down some general propositions which determine the results of the continued, and perhaps varied, actions oſ moving ſorces: md we must mark the diſſerent efſects oſ the simple con- tinuation oſ action, and also those oſ the variations in this continued action, hoth in respect oſ intensity and directionn. The efſect oſ a mere continuance oſ action must be an acceleration of the motion; or a retardation of it, if the force continue to act in the opposite direction. The effect of the continued action oſ a transverse ſorce must be a continual deſlection, that is, a curvilineal motion: These must therefore now occupy our attention in their order. . OF ACCELERATED AND RETARDED MOTIONS. 7. ALL men can perceive, that a stone dropped from the hand, or sliding down an uniſorm slope, has its motion continually accelerated, and that the motion oſ an arrow rising perpendicularly through the air is continually retarded; and they feel no difficulty in conceiving these changes of motion as the effects oſ the continual operation oſ their weight or heavinesss The ſalling stone is in a difſerent condition in respeet oſ motion in the beginning and the end oſ its ſfal. In what respect do these states of the body differ? Only in respeet to what we call its velocity. This is an aſſection oſ motion; it is an expression oſ the relation between the two notions or jdeas which concur to form the idea of motion, namely, the space and the time. These are all the circumstances that we observe in a motionn. Time elapses, and during its eurrency a space is deseribed. The term velocily expresses the magnitude of the space which corresponds to some unit oſ time. Thus, the rate oſ a ships motion is determined, when ve say that it is nine miles in an hour, or nine miles per hour. We sometimes say (but aukwardly)  The motion is at the rate, or with the velocity, oſ a mile in three days It is most conveniently expressed by a number of some given units oſ length, which completely make up the line described during this unit oſ time. But the mechanicians æxpress it in a way more general by a ſraction, of which the numerator is a number oſ inches, ſeet, yards, fathoms, or miles, and the denominator is the number of seconds, minutes, or hours, employed in moving along this line. This is a very proper expression; ſor when we speak of any velocity, and continue to reason from it, we eonceive ourselves to speak oſ something that remains the same, in the diſſerent occasions oſ using the term. Now iſ the velocity be constant, it is indifferent how long the line may be; hecause the time oſ its description will be lengthened in the same proportionn Thus if 48 feet be descrihed in 12 seconds, 36 ſeet will be deseribed in 9 seconds, I6 feet will described in 4 seconds, &e. Now 33, %, and, are ſractions oſ equal value, being equal to , or 4, that is, to the velocity oſ 4 ſeet per second. The value of this ſraetion, or the quotient oſ the number of the units of length, divided by the number of units oſ time, is the number of those units of length deseribed uniſormly in one unit of time. But how shall we determine the velocity in any instant or in any point oſ a motion that is continually changing? Suppose that a body has ſallen 144 feet, and that we would Ascertain its velocity in that point oſ its ſall, or the velocity which it has in passing through that point? In the next second the body ſalls 112 feet ſarther. This cannot be the measure oſ the velocity at the beginning oſ the fourth or the end oſ the third secondd It is too great. The ſall during the preceding second was 50 ſeet. This is 80112 192 ] F/  96, is probably more exact. Due attention to the nature oſ this motion shews us, that 96 is the proper measure, or that the motion at that instant is at the rate oſ O6 feet per second. But it is peculiar to this kind oſ motion that the half sum oſ the spaces described in two succeeding æqual moments is the measure oſ the velocity in the middle instant. Therefore this method will not generally give 100 small. The mean of these two, or un accurate measure. Yet it is indispensably nocessary ſo obtain some accurate measure; ſor iĩt is in this particular alone that the state of the body differs ſrom its similar state in another instant. The difſerence of place makes no distinction; ſor if a body continue its motion unchanged, its condition in every different instant of time, or point oſ space, is unchanged or the same. The change of place is not a change of motion, hut is involved in the very conception oſ the continuation oſ the motion. The change of condition consists, thereſore, in the change of velocity: Thereſore the change oſ velocity is the only indieation, and the only measure oſ the action (perhaps accumulated) oſ the changing ſorce It is thereſore the chieſ object oſ our search; and accũrate measures of velocity are absolutely necessary. l Wahen the velocity changes continually, there can be no actual measure oſ it. In what then does the magnitude oſ a velocity consist, when there is no actual measure oſ it? It is a certain undeseribahle nETERMINATION; by which, iſ not changed, a certain space would be uniformly described in a given unit of time. Thus we know, that if, when a stone has ſallen 16 feet, its motion be directed along a horizontal plane, without diminution, it will move on for ever at the rate oſ 32 ſeet per second. The space which would be thus described is not the velocity, but the measure of the velocity. But the proportions of those spaces, being the proportions of those measures, are the proportions oſ the velocities themselves. We may discover these proportions in the ſollowing manner: 72. Let ACG (fig. 13) be a line described by a hody with a motion anyhow continually, but gradually, varied; and Jet it be required to determine the proportion oſ the velocity in any point C io the velocity in any other point F. AxionIſ A be to B in a ratio that is greater than any ratio less than that oſ C to D, but less than any ratio greater than that of C to D, then A is to B as C to D-  Take the straight line ac  to represent the time oſ the body's motion along ACG, so that the points, qa, c, ſ. g, may represent the instants oſ time in which the body passes through the points A, C, V, G; and the portions ac, ef, sę, oſ the line a g, may represent the times employed in deseribing the portions AC, CF, FG; and thereſore a c is to a f as the time oſ describing AC to the time oſ describing AF. Moreover, let h k no be a line so related to the straight line a c fg, by the perpendicular ordinates a h, ck, ſn, go, that the areas a c k h, a fn h, a go h, may be proportional to the portions AC, AF, AG, oſ the line described by the moving body; and let this relation be true with respect to every point B, D, E, &e. and the corresponding points b, d, e, &e. Then it is aſfirmed, that the velocity in the point C is lo the velocity in the point F as c k is to ſn. Let the equal lines be, cd, ef, ſg, represent equal moments of time, and let B, D, E, G, he the points through which the body is passing at the instants b, d, e, 7 Then the areas bike, c kld, emn f, ſn og, will represent, and be proportional to, the spaces BC, CD, EF, FG, which are deseribed during the moments be, c d, ef, ſęDraw ip parallel to a g, so as to make the rectangle bt p c equal to the trapezium bike; and draw the lines qc, ur, s x, in the same manner, so that each rectangle may be equal to its corresponding trapezium. If the motions had heen uniform during the moments be and ſg, that is, if the spaces BC and FG had been uniformly deseribed, then the velocity in the point C would have heen to the velocily in the point F as cꝓ to ſæ: For since the rectangles bt pc and ſ⸗x g are respectively equal to the trapeziums b ilee and ſnog; and since bil c is to snog as BC is to FG, the rectangle b t pc is to the rectangle ſs x g ns BC to FG. But because those Lwo rectuigles have equal altitudes be and ſ g, they are to each other in the proportion of their bases c » and gxæ, or cꝓ and ſs. Thereſore BC is to FG as c ꝑ to ſ. But if BC and FG are uniformly described in equal times, they arę proportional to the velocities oſ those uniform motions. Thereſore c p is to ſæ as the velocity with which BC is uniſormly described to the velocity with which FG ©s uniſormly descrihed in an equal time. But the motion expressed by the figure is nol uniſorm, because the line h l o recedes ſrom the axis a , and the areas, cut ofſ by the parallel ordinates, increase in a greater proportion than the corresponding parts of the axis; that is, the spaces inerease ſaster than the times: ſor the moments hę, e d, e ſ, ſg, being all equal, it is evident that ihe corresponding slips oſ ithe area eontinually augment, The motion is swiſter at the instant c than at the instant b, and the velocity at the instant c is greater than that with which the space BC would be uniſormly described in the same time. For the same reason, the velocity at the instant ſ is less than that with which the space FG would he uniſormly described in the same time. Thereſore the velocity at the instant c is to the velocity at the instant f in a greater ratio than that oſ c ꝑ to ſ⸗. In the very same manner, it will appear, by comparing the motion during the moment c d with the motion during the moment e f, that the velocity at the instant c is to the velocity at the instant ſ in a less ratio than that cq to fr. Thereſore the velocity in the point C is to the velocity in the point F in a greater ratio than that oſ cꝑ to ſs, but in a less ratio than that of c  to ſr. But by continually diminishing the equal moments b c, e d, e f, ſ8, it is evident that c ꝑ and c ; continually approach Lo equality with c k; and f r and fs continually approach to equality with ſ n, that when c ꝑ is less than c k, ſ5 is grenter than ſn, and when c q is greater than ę h, ſ r is less than ſn. Thereſore the velocity in the point C is to the veloeity in the point F in a ratio that is greater than the ratio of oy line less than  è to ony line greater than ſu, but which is less than the ratio of any line greater than  ſ to apy line less thun ſ 2.. Thereſore the ratio oſ the velocity in C to the velocity in  is greater than any ratio that is less than that of c L to ſ n; but it is less than any ratio that is greater than that oſ c  o ſ n. Thereſore the velocity in the point C is 1o the velocity in the point Fas c k o ſn This important theorem may be expressed in more general lerms as ſollows: If the abacissa a g of a line h k o represent the time of any uotion, and if ihe areas bounded hy porallel ordinates he proportional io the spuces decribed, the ordinales are proportional lo the velacities. Ruxans. The propriety or aptitude of expressing the time by the portions of the axis a c g, will, perhaps, appear more clearly in the ſollowing manner. Let a c g he any straight line, and let  & v he another line, straight or ourved, Let the straight line a h2, perpendicular to a g, be carried uniſormly down along this line, keœping always perpendicular to it, and thereſore always parallel to ils first position a h2. In its various situations o  æ, e m æ, lc. it will cut ofſ areasa c  h, a em h, Ee. hounded hy the axis hy the ordinates and c h, or hy the ordinates a h and e m, &e. and by the line h&g. By this motion the moveahle ordinate is said, in the language of modern geometry, to generate the areas a c  h, a e m h, &, At the same time, let a point A move along the line ACG, setting out from A at the instant when the line a z sets out ſrom a; and let the motion oſ the point A be 50 regulated, that the spaces AB, AC, AD, &e. generated hy this motion, may increase at the same rate with the areas a b, i h, a c k h, a d lh, &e. or such that we shall have AB to AC as ubih to ac k h, &e. It is plain, that ihe motion along AG is the same with that described in the enunciation oſ the proposition: ſor because the motion oſ the ordinate a æ, along the axis a g, is supposed to be uniform, the spaces a b, a c, a d, &e. are proportional to the times in which they are described, and may thereſore be taken to measure or to represent those times 73. Cor. I. In a motion continually voried, the velocities in the different points of the palh ore to each other in the limiting or ullimate ratio of the spaces described in equal times, those times being supposed to diminish continually: for it is evident, that if the equal moments be, c d, e ſ, ſã. are supposed to diminish continually, till the instants b and d coalesce with c, and the instants e and g coalesce with ſ; then the ratio of c k to ſn is the limit oſ the continually increasing ratio oſ c to fs, or oſ the continually diminishing ratio oſ c q to fr. Sir Isanc Newton calls this the ultimate ratio of cꝑ to ſs, or of cq to ſr. Now the ratio of c ꝓ to ſ is, by construction, the same with the ratio oſ the rectangle bſ ꝑc to the rectangle ſ⸗ x g, and the ratio oſ è ꝗ to ſr is the same with the ratio oſ the rectangle c ꝗ v d to the rectangle e u r . But the ratio of the rectangle b t  e to the rectangle fæ æ g, is the same with the ratio oſ the space bi k e to the space ſn og; that is (by hypothesis), the same with the ratio oſ the space BC to the space FG; and the ratio of the rectangles c q vd and eur ſ is the same with that oſ the spaces CD and EF. Thereſore the ratio of the velocity at C to the velocity at F is the same with the ultimate ratio of the small increments BC, FG, or CD, EF oſ the spaces generated in very small and equal times. It is also evident, that because the ratio of c  to ſn is the limit both oſ the ratio of c ꝑ to ſ⸗ and oſ the ratio oſ cq to ſr, these ultimate ratios are the same, and that we may say that the velocity in C is to the velocity in F in the ultimate ratio of BC to EF, or in the ultimate ratio of CD to FG. We aiso can easily pereeive, that the ratio oſ the area bilc to the area e mn ſ approaches more near to the ratio oſ c  to ſn as we take the moments b e and eſ smaller. Thereſore, in many eases oſ praetice, where iĩt may be easy to measure the spaces deseribed in the diſſerent small moments oſ the motion, but diſficult to ascertain their ultimate ratio, so as to obtain accurate measures oſ the proportions of the velocities, ve may reduce the errors oſ measurement to something very insignificant, by taking these moments extremely small; and we shall diminish the error still more, by taking the proportion oſ the half sum oſ BC and CD to the halſ sum oſ EF and FG fſor the proportion oſ the velocities in C and F. 1It often happens that we have it not in our power to compare the spaces described in small moments which arę precisely equal. Still we can ſind the exact proportion oſ the velocities, i? we can ascertain the ultimate ratio of the increments oſ the spaces, and the ultimate ratio oſ the moments of time in which these increments are described; ſor it is plain, by considering the gradual approach of the points ꝓ and r to the points  and n, that the ratio of c æ to fſ n is still the ultimate ratio oſ the bases oſ rectangles equal to the mixtilineal areas, whether the altitudes (representing the moments) are equal or not. Now the bases oſ two rectangles are in the proportion oſ the rectangles directly, and oſ their altitudes inversely. But the ultimate ratio oſ the altitudes is the ultimate ratio oſ the moments, and the ultimate ratio oſ the rectangles is the ultimate ratio of the spaces deseribed in those unequal moments. Thereſore, in such cases, we have, 74. Cor. 2. The velocities are in the ratio compounded of ihe direct ultimate ratio of the momentary increments of the spaces, and the inverse ultimate ratio of the increments (or moments) of the times in which these incremenis of the spaces are made. If s, v, and i, are taken to represent the magnitudes oſ he spaces, velocities, and times, and iſ s, v, and , are taken always in the limiting or ultimate ratio oſ their momentary increments, we shall have » always in the proportion of a directly, and oſ t inversely. We express thias hy the proportional equation » ga;s which s :/ Or t 3 lu. is equivalent to the analogy V: » V: o æOSi:5T. 75. N. B. Here ohserve, that this is not the only way oſ stating the relation oſ space and timethe abscissa may be made the time and the ordinate the space; then the velocity y æ The converse of this proposition may be thus oxpressed. 16. If the axis a g of the line h k o represent the lime of a voried motion along the line AG, and if the ordinates a h, b i, c k, &c. be as the velocities in the instants a, b, c, or in the points A, B, C; ihen the areus abih, ackh, a d lh, be. are proportional to the spaces AB, AC, AD, &e. This may be domonstrated in the same way with the former; but the indirect demonstration is more brief, and equally strict. Iſ the spaces AC, AF, &e. are not proportional to the mreas ac k h, a ſn h, he. they are proportional to some other areas a c k i, a ſ n V, &e. which are bounded by the same ordinates, and by another line  k ”v. But because the areas a ckV, a fn i, &c. are always proportional to the spaces AC, AF, &e. described on the line AG, the velocity in the point C is to the velocity in the point F as the ordinate c k is to the ordinate f . But, by hypothesis, the velocity in C is to the velocity in F as c k to f n, and sn is equal to ſa; which is absurd. Thereſore the spaces AC, AF, are not proportional to any other areas, &e. Tſ. Cor. Thæ ultimate ratio of the momentury incremenis of the spaces is compounded of the ratio of the velocities, and the ultimate rutio of the increments of the times: ſor when the moments b ę, e ſ, are equal, it is evident, that the ultimate ratio oſ the rectangles be pt, e ſ r u is the same with the ultimate ratio oſ the inerements oſ the spaces But the ultimate ratio of these rectangles is the same with that of their bases e p and ſr; that is, the ratio of c : to ſn, that is, the ratio of the velocities And when the moments are unequal, the ratio oſ the rectangles is compounded oſ the ratio oſ their bases and the ratio oſ their altitudes: that is, compounded of the ratio oſ the veloeities and the ultimate ratio oſ the moments oſ time. We have, thereſore, S:3  VT: oi, and s = vi. It most commonly happens, that we can only observe the aceumulated results oſ varied motions; and in them we only observe a space passed over, and a certain portion of time ſhat has elapsed during the motion. But being able to distinguish the portions oſ the whole space vhich are deseribed in known porſions of the whole time, and having made such observations in several parts of the motion, we discover the general law that the motion alfects, and we aſſirm this law to hold universally, even though we have not observed it in every point. We do this with a degree oſ probability and confidence proportioned to the ſrequency oſ our ohservation. It is not till we have done this, that we can make use oſ the first oſ these two propositions, whieh enables us to ascertain the velocity oſ the motion in its different moments. Thus if we observe, that a stone in ſalling deseends one ſoot in the quarter of a second, I6 ſeel in a second, 64 feet in two seconds, and I44 ſeet in three seconds; the general aw immediately observed is, that the spuces deseribed re as the squares oſthe times; ſor I is to I6 as the square I to the square oſ I. Again, 16 is to 64 as I' to 2; and I6 is to I44 as I? to 3°. Hence we inſer, with great probahility, that the stone would fall 36 ſeet in a second and a halſ; for 16 is to 36 as I° to I3?; and ve conclude in the same way ſor all other parts oſ the motion. 78. This immediate observation of the analogy between the spaces and the squares of the times suggests an easy determination oſ the velocity in this particular kind of motion; and it merits particular notice, being very oſten referred too. We can take a g to represent the time; and then, because the areas which are to represent the spaces described must be proportioned to the squares oſ the portions of a gz we perceive that the line which comes in place of h k o must be a straight line drawn ſrom a. For example, the straight line a 2 For this is the only boundary whieh will give areas ab⸗, a cæ, a d3; &e. proportional to a bẽ, a c?, a d?, &e. And we perceive, that any straight line drawn ſrom a vill have this property. Having thus got our representations oſ the times and the spaces; we say, on the authority of our theorem, that the velocity at the instant b is to the velocity at the instant d as bã to d3, &e. And now we begin to make inferences, purely geometrical, and express our discovery oſ the velocities in a very general and simple manner. We remark, that b⸗ is to dò as a b is to a d; and we make the same aſſirmation concerning the magnitudes represented by these liness We say that the velocity at the instant b ĩs to the velocity at the instant d as the time a ò is to the time a d. We say, in terms still more general, that the velocities are proportional to the times ſrom the beginning of the motion. We moreover perceive, that the spaces are also proportional to the squares oſ the acquired velocities; or the velocities are as the square roots oſ the spaces. We can farther infer, from the properties oſ the triangle, that the momentary increments oſ the spaces are proportional to the momentary increments oſ the squares of the times, or of the squares oſ the velocities. We also observe, that not only the whole acquired velocities are proportional to the whole elapsed times, but that the increments oſ the velocities are proportional to the times in which they are acquired; ſor æ is to ,2 as be to d f, &e. Equal increments of velocity are thereſore acquired in equal times. Thereſore such a motion may, in great propriety oſ language, be denominated a uNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION; that is, a motion in which ue observe the spaces proportioned to the squares of ihe times, is a motion uniformly accelerated; and spaces in the duplicate ratio oſ the times form the ostensible characteristic oſ an uniformly accelerated motion. 79. Lastly, iſ we draw:  parallel to the axis a b, we perceive that the rectangle ae. » is double oſ the triangle ae- Now, because a e represents the time oſ the motion, and e. represents the acquired velocity, the reetangle a e: » will represent the space which would be uniſormly described with the velocity e: during the time ae. But the triangle a e: represents the space really deseribed with the uniſormly accelerated motion during the same time. Hence we inſer, that the space that is deseribed in any time, with a motion increasing uniſormly ſrom nothing, is one halſ oſ the space which would be uniſormly described during the same time with the final velocity. These are but a part oſ the inſerences which we may draw ſrom the geometrical properties oſ those representations which we had selected of the diſſerent measurable afſections oſf motionn. We may aſſirm, with respeet to the motions themselves, all the inſerences which relate to magnitude and proportion, and thus improve our knowledge of the motions. We took the opportunity oſ this very simple and perspicuous example, to give our young readers a just con- coption of the muthematical method oſ prosecuting meeha⸗ nical knowledge, and to make them sensible of the um questionable authority for every theorem deduced in this manner. One oſ the most important is, 0 discover ihe aceumulated result of a motion of which we only observe the momentary increments. This is to be done by finding ilie area, or portions of the area, oſ the mixtilineal space a goh; and it is evidently anulogous to the inverse method oſ ſluxions, or the integral ealeulus. In most cases, we must avail ourselves oſ the corollary s &  i, and we obtain the solution of our question only in the cases where our knowledge oſ the quantities 5, i, and » (considered as geometrical magnitudes; that is, as lines and surſaces), enables us to distover æand i. OF ACCELERATING AND RETARDING FORCES. 80. HAvI™G thus diseovered the proportions of the velocities in motions varying in any mamer vhatever, we can ohserve the variations which happen in them. These voriations are the effects, and the only marks and meꝶsures of the changing foreess. They are the characteristies oſ their kinds (considered merely as moving ſorces); that is, the indieations of the directions in which they act; ſor this is the only difference in ind of which they are susceptible in this general point oſ view. If they increase the velocity, their direction must be conceived as the same with that oſ the previous motion; because the result oſ the action of a force is equivalent to the composition of the motion whieh thut foree would produce in a quieseent body with the motion alvendy existing; and an increase oſ velocity is equivalent to the composition of ã motion in the same direction. Having no other. mark oſ the ſoree but the aceelera- tion, we have no other name for it in the abstract doetrines of dynamics, and we call it an ACOELERATING PORCE. Hæd it retarded the motion, we should have ealled it æ RETARDING PORCE. In like manner, we have no measure oſ the magnitude or intensity oſ an accelerating force, but the acceleration vwhich it produees. In order thereſore to investigate the powers which produce all the ehanges of motion, we must endeavour to obtain measures oſ the neceleration. A continual increase of velocity is the eſſect oſ the continued action oſ accelerating ſorcess. If equal increments of velocity are produced in every sueceeding equal moment oſ time, we cannot conceive that there ĩs any change in the accelerating forcee Thereſore a uniformly accelerated motion is the mark of the unvaried action of an aceelerating force, that is, oſ the continued action oſ a constant force; oſ a foree whose intensity is always the same. When thereſore we observe a body describe spaces proportional to the squares oſ the times, we must infer that ĩt is urged forward by a foree whose intensity does not change; and, on the other hand, a constant ſorce must produee a uniſormly accelerated motion by its continuei action. And iſ any previous circumstances assure us oſ this continued action of an invaried ſorce, ve may make all the inſerences which were mentioned under the artiele oſ uniſormly accelerated motion. That force must surely be aceounted double which produces a double increment of velocity in the same time hy ils uniſorm action, we can ſorm ho other estimation oſ its magnitude And, in general, acceleratiug ſorces must be accounted proportional to the increments of velocity which they produce, by acting uniformly during the sume or equal limes. Supposing them to act on a holy at rest. Then the velocity produeed is itsel? the increment; and ve must say, that acce lerating ſorces are proportional to the veloities which they generate in a body in equal times. And vOL. I. o because we ſound (No. 79.) that the space deseribed with a uniſormly accelerated motion is halſ the space which would he uniſormly described in the same time with the final velocity, which space is the direct measure oſ this velocity, and because halves have the same proportion with the wholee may say, that occelerating forces are proportional to the spaces through which they impel a body from rest in equal times by their uniform action. This is an important remark; because it gives us an easy measure of the ſorce, without the trouble of first computing the velocitiess It also gives us the only distinct notion that we have oſ the measurement oſ forces by the motions which they producee When speaking of the composition of forces, we distinguished or denominated them by the sides and diagonal oſ a parallelogram. These lines must be conceived as proportional to the spaces through which the ſorees urge the body uniſormly during the small and insensihle time oſ their action, which time is supposed to be the same ſor hoth forees; for the sides oſ the parallelogram are supposed to be sepurately described in equal times, and thereſore to be proportional to the velocities generated by the constituent foreess If indeed the ſorces do not act uniſormly, nor similarly, nor during equal times, we cannot say (without farther investigation) what is the proportion oſ the intensity oſ the forces, nor can we inſer the composition oſ their action. We must at least suppose, that in every instant oſ this very small time oſ their joint action, their direction remains unchanged, and that their intensities are in the same ratio. We shall see by and by, that with these conditions the sides oſ the parallelogram are still proportional to the velocities generated. In the mean time, we may take the spaces through which a body is uniformly impelled from rest (that is, with a uniſormly accelerated motion) as the measures of the ſorces; yet these spaces are hut the halves oſ the measures oſ the velocities. Then, iſ a body he moving with the velocity oſ 2 ſeet per second, and an accelerating ſorce acts on it during a second, and iſ this force be such that it would impel the body (from a state oſ rest) 16 ſeet, it will add to the body a velocity oſ 52 ſeet per second. Aecordingly, this is the eſſeet of gravitythe weight oſ a pound of lead may be eonsidered as a ſorce which does not vary in its intensity. We Enow that it will cause the lead to fall 16 feet in a econd; but if the body has already fallen 16 feet, we Enow that it is then moving with the velocity oſ 82 feet per second. And the ſact is, that it will ſall 48 ſeet farther in the next second, and will have acquired the velocity of 64 feet per second. It has thereſore received an augmentation of 32 feet of velocity hy the action oſ gravity during the second second; and gravity is in fact a constant ſorce, causing equal increments oſ velocity in equal times, however great the velocities may be It does not act like a stream oſ ſluid, whose impulse or action diminishes as the solid body withdras ſrom it by yielding. But supposing that we have not compared the inerements oſ velocity uniſormly acquired during equal times, in what manner shall we measure the accelerating ſorees ? In such a case, that ſorce must he accounted double which generates the same velocity, by acting uniſormly during halſ the time; ſfor when the foree is supposed invariable, the changes of veloeity which it produces are proportional to the times of its action; therefore if it produces an equal velocity in halſ the time, it will produce a double velocity in an equal time, and is thereſore a double forcee The same may be said oſ every proportion of time in which an equal change oſ velocity is produced by the uniſorm action oſ an accelerating force. The ſorce must be accounted greater in the same proportion that the time required for the produetion of a given velocity in a hody is less. Hence we inſer, that accelerating ſorces are in- versely proporiional to the time in which a given change of velocily is produced by their uniform action. By combining these two propositions we establish this general theorem; 62 Acctlerating forces are proportional to the changes of velocily which they produce in a body by their uniform action directly, and to the times in which these changes are produced inversely. Iſ, thereſore, A and a are the ſorces, V and v the changes oſ velocity, and T' and ? the proportions oſ time in which they are uniformly produced, we have v j v A: a=Vi vT, =7: ſũi And a æ V The formula o is not restricted to any particular magnitude oſ  and ?. It is true, thereſore, vhen the portion oſ time is diminished without end; for since the action is supposed uniſorm, the increment of velocity is lessened in the same proportion, and the value oſ the ſrao, tion v remains the same. The characters or symbols v and ? are commonly used to express ſinile portions oſ v and t. The symbols ò and ſ are used by Newton to express the same things taken in the ultimate or limiting ratioo. They are usually considered as indefinitely small portions of v and . We small abide by the ſormula a t 83. It must always be kept in mind, that v ànd t are abstract numbers; and that » reſers to some unit of space, such as a foot, an inch, a yard; and that t refers to some unit of time, such as an hour, a minute, a second; and especially that a is the number of the same units oſ space, which will be uniformly described in one unit of the time with the velocity generated, by the force acting uniſormly during that unit. It is twice the space actually deseribed by the body during that unit when impelled from rest by the accelerating ſorce. It is necessary to keep hold of these clear ideas oſ the quantities expressed by the symbols. On the other hand, when the measure oſ the accelerating foree is previously known, we employ the theorem a Vv; that is, the addition made to the velocity during the whole, or any part, oſ the time oſ the action of the ſorce, is obtained by multiplying the acceleration of one unit oſ time by the number of such units contained in ?. These are evidently leading theorems in dynamies; because all the mechanical powers of nature come under the predicament oſ accelerating or retarding forces. It is the collection oſ these in any subject, and the manner in vhich they accompany, or are inherent in it, which determine the mechanical character oſ that subject; and thereſore the phenomena by which they are brought into view are the characteristic phenomena. Nay, it may even be questioned, whether the phenomena bring any thing more into view. This force, of which we speak so ſamiliarly, is no object of distinet contemplation; it is merely a something that is proportional to- And when we obt serve, that the y , found in the motions that result ſrom T the vielnity of a hody A, is double of the 2, which resulis t ſrom the vicinity of another body B; we say that a force resides in A, and that it is double of the ſorce residing in B. The accelerations are the things immediately and truly expressed by these symbols. And the whole science of dynamics may be completely taught without once employing the word force, or the conception which we imagine that we ſorm oſ it. It is oſ no use till we come to study the mechanical history of bodies. Then, indeed, we must have some way oſ expressing the ſact, that an acceleration = u is observed in every thing on the surſace oſ this globe; and that an acceleration æm is observed over all the surſace oſ the sun. These facts are characteristic oſ this earth and oſ the sun; and we express them shortly by saying, that such and such forces reside in the earth and in the sun. It will preserve us ſrom many mistakes and puæzling doubts, iſ we resolutely adhere to this meaning of the term ſorce; and this will carry mat hematical evidence through the whole oſ our investigations. 84. As velocity is not an immediate ohject of contemplation, and all that we observe oſ motion is a space and a time, it may be proper to give an expression of this measure of accelerating ſorce which involves no other idea. Supposing the body to have been previously at rest, ve have a - H Multiply both parts oſ the fraction by t, which does not : . ot change its value, and we have a 7 But vt=s; and . 5 thereſore a -. t1⸗ The ſormula a h is equivalent to the proportion t: I=5: a; and a would then be the space through which the accelerating foree would impel the body in one unit oſ the time . But this is only half of the measure oſ the velocity which the accelerating ſorce generates during that unit oſ time. For this reason we did not express the accelerating ſorce by an ordinary equation, but used the symbol 2 Ih this case, therefore, oſ uniform action, ve may express the accelerating force by 2s VEEE The ſollowing theorem is of still more extensive use in all dynamical disquisitions. 85. Accelerating forces are proportional to the momentary increments of the squares of the velocities direetly, and to the spaces along which they are uniformly acquired inversely. Let AB, AC, and AD (fig. 14.), be three lines, described in the same or equal times by the uniſorm action of accelerating forees; the motions along these lines will be uiſormly accelerated, and the lines themselves will be proportional to the forces, and may be employed as their measures. On the greatest oſ them AD, describe the semicirele ABCD, and apply the other two lines AB, AC is chords AB, AC. Drav EB, FC perpendicular to AD. Take any small portions Bb, Ce of AB and AC, and draw be, c f perpendiculor to AD, and E h and F & parallel to AB and AC. Then, because the triangles DAB and BAE are similar, we have AD: AE æ AD?: AB?. And because AD is 10 AB as the velocity generated at D is to the velocity generated at B (the times being equal), ve have AD to AE as the square of the velocity at D to the square oſ the velocity at B; which we may express thus: AD: AEæV⸗, D: V' B. For the same reasons ve have also AD: AF æV⸗, D: Vẽ C. Thereſore AE: AF V B: V⸗, C. But because in any uniſormly accelerated motion, the spaces are as the squares oſ the acquired velocities, we have also AE: AeV⸗, B: Vi , and AF: Ar mV⸗, B: Ve ę. Thereſore E e is to Fſ as the increment oſ the square oſ the velocity acquired in the motion along Bb to the increment oſ the square oſ the velocity acquired along Ce. But, by similarity oſ the triangles ABD and E e , we have AB: ADEe: EA; and, in like manner, AD: AC Fl: Ff. Thereſore AB: ACEe xFE: Fſf xEA Now AB and AC are proportional to the ſorces which accelerate the body along the lines AB and AC; Ee and Ff are proportional to the increments oſ the squares oſ the velocities acquired in the motions along the portions Bb and Cc; and E h and F  are equal to those portions respectively. The ratio of AB to AC is compounded oſ the direct ratio of E e to Ff; and the iuverse ratio oſ Eh to FE. The proposition is thereſore demonstrated. The proportion may be exprèssed thus: AB: AC x : . and may be expressed by the proportional equation AB æ V or, symbolically, u ) ll RENARE. Because the motion along any oſ these threæ Iines is uniformly accelerated, the relation hetween spaces, times, and velocities, may be represented by means oſ the triangle ABC (fig. 15.); where AB represents the time, BC the velocity, and ABC the space. Iſ BC be taken equal to AB, the triangle is half oſ the square ABCF of the velocity BC; and the triangle ADE is half of the square ADEG of the velocity DE. Let Dld and Bb he two moments oſ time, equal or unequal. Then Dde E and B be C are halſ the increments oſ the squares oſ the velocities DE and BC, acquired during the moments D d and Bb. It vas demonstrated, that the ratio oſ the area Dd e E, to the area B b c C is compounded of the ratio of DE to BC, and the ultimate ratio oſ Dd to Bb But Dd und B b are respectively equal to: e and  . There- ſore Dd e E is to Bbe C, in the ratio compounded of the ratio oſ DE to BC, and the ultimate ratio oſ. e to æe. Iſ we represent DE and BC by V and ⸗, the: e and  c must be represented by V and v the increments of V and »; and then the compound ratio will be the ratio of VV to v7; and iſ ve take the ultimate ratio of the moments, and consequently the ultimate ratio of the inerements of the velocities, we have the ratio oſ VV to v 2. Iſ, thereſore, V and 9 represent the squares oſ the velocities, V and v ? will represent, not the inerements oſ those squares, but halſ the increments of them. We may now represent this proposition concerning accelerating forces by the proportional equation ES: e. ; and ve must consider this as equivalent with 5 Vvey⸗ a= 563' ; keeping always in mind, that a, V, and ⸗, relate to the same units oſ time and space, and that a is that number oſ units oſ the scale on which S and s are measured, which is run over in one unit of time. This will be more elearly conceived by taking an examplee Let us ascertain the accelerative power of gravity, supposing it to act uniformly on a body. Let the spaces be measured in ſfeet and the time in seconds. It is a matter oſ observation, that when a body has ſallen 64 ſeet, it has acquired a velocity of 64 feet per seeond: and that when it has, ſallen 144 feet, it has acquired the velocity of 6 feet per seeond. We want to determine what velocity gravity communieated to it by acting on it during one second. We have V? æ 0216, and v?  4096; and thereſore V?v? 5120. S æ 144, and s  64, and S  5s  80, and 2 6& 5) =æ I60. Now næ = 329. Thereſore gravity hus generated the relocity 32 feet per second by acting uniformly during one second. a= 66. The augmentation of the square of ihe velocity is proportional to the force and to the spuce jointly. For because T a s ve have a s  vo. Thus we learn, that a given force, acting uniſormly on a body along a given space, produces the same increment oſ the square of the velocity, whatever the previous velocity may have beenn Also, in the same manner as we formerly found that the augmentation oſ the velocity was proportioned to the time during which the ſorce has acted, so the augmentation of the square oſf the velocity is proportional to the space along which it has acted. It is pretty plain, that all that we have said oſ the uniſorm action oſ an accelerating force may be aſfirmed of a returding force, taking a diminution or decrement oſ velocity in place oſ an inerement. A uniſormly retarded motion is that in which the decrements of velocity in equal times are equal, and the whole decrements are proportional to the whole times oſ actionn. Such a motion is the indication oſ a constant or invariable ſorce acting in a direction opposite to that of the motionn. We conceive this to be the case when an arrow is shot perpendicularly upwards; its weight is conceived as a ſorce continually pressing it perpendicularly downwards. In such motions, however great the initial velocity may be, the body will come to rest: because a certain determined velocity will be taken ſrom the body in each equal successive moment, and some multiple oſ this will exceed the initial velocity. Thereſore the veloeity will be extinguished before the end oſ a time that is the same multiple oſ the time in which the velocity was diminished by the quantity above mentioned. It is no less evident, that the time in which any velocity will be extinguished by an opposing or retarding force is equal to the time in which the same ſorce would generate this velocity in the body previously at rest. Thereſore, B7. Ist. The times in which diſſerent initial velocities will be extinguished by the same opposing force are proportional to the initial velocities. 88. 2d. The distances to which the body will go till the extinetion oſ its velocity are as the squaves oſ the initial velocities. Sd. They are also as the squares oſ the times elapsed. 89. 4th. The distance to which a body, projected with any velocity, will go till its motion be extinguished by the uniſorm action oſ a retarding ſorce, is one half oſ the space which it would deseribe uniſormly during the same time with the initial velocity. Ir very rarely happens, that the foree which accelerates ſhe body acts uniformly, or with an unvaried intensity. The attraction oſ a magnet, for example, increases as the iron approaches it. The pressure of a spring diminishes us it unbends. The impulse of a stream of water or wind diminishes as the impelled surſace retires from it by yielding. Thereſore the efſects oſ accelerating ſorces are very imperſectly explained, till we have shewn what motions result from any given variation oſ force, and how to discover the variation of ſorce ſfrom the observed motion. This last question is perhaps the most important in the study of mochanical nature. It is only thus that we learn vwhat is usually called the nature of a mechanical foree This chieſly consists in the relation subsisting between the intensity oſ the force and the distance oſ the substance in which ĩt resides. Thus the nature of that power which produces all the planetary motions, is considered as ascertained when we have demonstrated that its pressure or intensity is inversely as the square oſ the distance ſrom the body in which it is supposed to reside. ' Acceleration expresses some relation of ſhe velocity and time. This relation may he geometrically expressed in a variety oſ ways. In figure 13. the uniſorm acceleration or the universal relation between the velocity and the time is very aptly expressed by the constant ratio oſ the ordinates and abscisses of the triangle a ꝗ The ratio of d to a d is the same with that of e: to a e, or that of ſo to o f, &e.; or the ratio of the increment of velocity - to the increment oſ the time à æ or b c, or that of i ⸗ to j - v : i, &c. This ratio æ æ: æ ⸗ is equivalent to the symhol 7 But when the spaces described in a varied motion are represented hy the areas bounded by a curve line h ſ o, we no longer have that constant ratio of the increments of the ordinates and abscisses. 90. Thereſore, in order to obtain measures oſ the accelerating ſorces, or at least oſ their proportions, let the abscissa a e g (figz. 13) of the line h k o again represent the time oſ a motion. But let the areas bounded by parallel ordinates now represent the velocities, that is, let the whole area increase during the time a & at the same rate with the velocities oſ the motion along the line AG. In this case the ordinates h i, c k, d I, &c. will be as the accelerations at the instants b, c, d, &c. or in the points B, C, D, &e. This is demonstrated in the same way as the former proposition (No. 72) Iſ the accelerating force be supposed constant during any two equal moments b c and T&, the rectangles h c p t and ſ  x s would express the increments of velocity uniformly acquired in equal times, and their bases c » and ſ s would have the ratio of the accelerations, or oſ the accelerating forcess But as the velocities expressed by the ſigure inerease ſuster than the times during every moment, the ſorce at the instant c is to the force at the instant ſin a greater ratio than that of c p to ſę; but, ſor similar reasons, it is in a less ratio than that oſ c ꝗ to ſ r3 and thereſore (as in the other proposition) the force at the instant c ĩs to tne ſoree at the instant f as c è to fn. 9l. Cor. Because e ꝑ is to fs in the ratio compounded oſ the direct ratio oſ the rectangle c p t h to the rectangle ſs x g, and the inverse ratio oſ the altitude b c to the altitude ſ ę; and because these rectangles are proportional to the inerements oſ velocity, and the ultimate ratio oſ the altitudes is the ultimate ratio of the moments or increments oſ the timewe must say, that the acceleroting forces ſthat is, their intensities or pressures producing acceleration) are directly as the increments of velocity, and inversely as the increments of the times: Which proposition may be expressed, in regard to two accelerations A and o, by this analogy: E A: o m L T Or by the proportional equation a 22. Also t a i =n, mi ſo i =. And thus do these theorems extend even to the cases where there cannot he observed ãn immediate measure, either oſ velocity or oſ acceleration; because neither the space nor the velocity increases uniſormly. v The theorem a 7 is employed when we would discover the variation in the intensity oſ some natural pover. We ohserve the motion, and represent it by a figure analogous to fiz. 13. where the abscissa represents the times, and the area is made to increase at the same rate with the spaces describedlc Then the ordinates will represent the velocities, or have the proportion of the velocities. Then we may draw a second curve on the other side oſ the same abscissa, such that the areas oſ this last curve shall be proportional to the ordinates oſ the first. The ordinates oſ this last curve are proportional to the accelerating ſorees.* 92. On the other hand, when we know ſrom other circumstances that a force, varying according to some known law, acts on a body, ve can determine its motionn. The intensity oſ the force in every instant being known, we can drav a line so related to another line representing the time that the ordinates shall be proportional to the forces: The areas will he proportional to the velocities. We can draw another curve to the same absciss, such that the ordinates of this shall be proportlonal to the areas oſ the other, that is, to the velocities of the motion. The areas of this second curve will be proportional to the spaces described. 93. We must now observe, that all that has been said coneerning the effects oſ accelerating forces continually varying, relates to changes of motion, independent of what the absolute motions may be. The areas of the Iine whose ordinates represent the velocities do not neeessurily represent the spaces deseribed, but the change made on the spaces described in the same time; not the motions, but the changes oſ motion. If, indeed, the body be supposed to be at rest when the forces begin to act, these areas represent the very spaces that are passed over, and the ordinates are the very velocitiess. In every case, however, the accelerations are the real inerements oſ the velocities. This circumstance gives a great extension to our theorems, and enables us to ascertain the disturbances oſ any species oſ regular motion, apart from the motions themselves, and thus avoid a complication which would ſre? See Barrows Lect. Geometr. passim. quently be inextricable in any other vay. And this process, which is merely mathematical, is perſectly conſormable to mechanieal principless It is in fact an application oſ the doctrine oſ the composition oſ motion: a doctrine rigidly demonstrated when we measure a mechanical ſorce by the change of motion which it produces. Acceleration is the continual composition of a nev motion with the motion already produced. We may learn ſrom this investigation oſ the value oſ an accelerating ſoree, that no finite change oſ velocity is effected in an instant by the action of an accelerating force. When the fig. 1S. is used for the scale oſ accelerations, and they are represented by the ordinates oſ the line h k o, the increment oſ velocity is represented by an area, that is, hy a slip oſ the whole area; which slip must have some altitude, or must occupy some portion of the abscissas which represents time. Some portion oſ time, however small it may be, must elapse heſore any measurable addition can be made to the veloeity. The velocity must change continuall As no motion can he conceived as instantaneous, because this would be to conceive, thaut in one instant the moving portiele is in every point oſ its momentary puth; s0 no velocity can change, by a finite quantity, in one instant; because this would be to conceive, that in that instant the particle had all the intervening velocities. The instant oſ change is at once the last instant oſ the preceding velocity, and the first oſ the succeeding, and therefore must belong to hoth. This cannot be conceived, or is absurd. As a body, in passing ſrom one part oſ space to another, must pass in suecession through all the intermediate places; s0, in passing ſrom one velocity to another, it must in succession have all the intermeiiate velocities. It must he continually accelerated; we must not say gradually, however small the steps. L 94. But to return ſrom this digression: The most ſrequent cases which come under examination do not shew us the relation between the ſorces and times, hut the relation between fortes und spaces. Thus, when a piece oſ iron is in the neighbourhood of a magnet, or a planet is considered in the neighbourhood of the sun, a force is acting on it in every point of its path, and ve have discovered that the intensity oſ this ſorce varies in a certain proportionn. Thus, a spring varies in ĩts pressure as it unbends; gunpowder presses less violently as it expands, &e. &e. Our knowledge is generally confined to some such efſeet as this We know, that while a body is moving along a line ADE (fig. 16.), it is urged forward by a ſorce, oſ which the intensity varies in the proportion of the ordinates BF, Cũ, DH, EI, &e. of the line FGHI. To investigate the motion or change of motion produced by the action of this force, let CD be supposed a very small portion of the space s, hich we may express by s. Drawv GK perpendicular to DH. Then, if ve suppose that the force acts with the unvaried intensity CG through the whole space CD, the rectangle CDEG vill express half oſ the increment of the square of the velocity (No. 65)0 We may suppose that the force acts uniſormly along the adjoining small space Dr with the intensity DH. The rectangle DH o r will in like manner express another half inerement of the square of the velocity. And in like manner ve may obtain a succession oſ such inerements. The aggregate or sum oſ them all will he halſ the difference between the square oſ the velocity at B and the square oſ the velocity at E. ii IF we employ fto express the indetermined or variable intensity oſ the accelerating ſoree, and » to express the voriable velocity, and v its inerement uniformly acquired; then the reetangle CDKG will be expressed by ſv. We have seen that this is equal to v ? Thereſore, in every case where we can tell the aggregate oſ all the quantities ſ s, it is plain that ve will obtain halſ the difference between the squares oſ the velocities in B and E, on the supposition that the intensity of the foree was constunt along ench little space, and varied by startss. Then, hy increasing the number, and diminishing t magnitude, oſ those little portions oſ the space without end, it is evident that we terminate in the expression of the reul state oſ the case, ĩ e. oſ a ſorce varying continually; and that in this case the aggregate oſ these rectungles occupies the whole arean AEIF, and is equivalent to the ſluent oſ ſ⸗, or to the symbol Jſi used by the foreign mathematicians to express this ſluent, which they indeed conceive as an aggregate oſ small rectangles 7ſ. And we see that this area expresses halſ of the augmentation of the square oſf the velocity. Thereſore, : If the absclssa AE (ſig. 16.) of u line FGI is the paih olong which a body is urged hy any accelerating force, ami iſ ithe ordinates BF, CG, DH, &c. are proportional to the forces acting in the poinis B, C, D, &e. the intercepted oreas BCGF, BEIF, &c. are proportional to the uugmentutions of the square of the velocity.* Observe that the areas BCGF and DEIH are also proportionãl to the augmentations made on the squares oſ the velocities in B and in D. Observe also, that it is indiſſerent what may have been the original velocity. The action oſ the ſorces represented by the ordinates make always the same addition to its square; and this addition is halſ the square oſ the velocity which those forces would generate in the body by impelling it ſrom rest in the point A J  ———————— æ Sece Newton's Principia, i. 30. vOL. I. H l1l4 DYNAMICS. . 96. Lastly, on this head, observe, that we can state what constant or variable ſorce will make the same augmentation of the square oſ the velocity by impelling the body uniſormly along the same space BE; or along what space a given force must impel the body, in order to produce the same increase of the square of its velocity. In the first case, ve have only to make a rectangle BENV equal to the area BEIF, and then B ? is the intensity oſ the constant ſorce wanted. In the second case, in which the force EO is given, we must make the rectangle A æ OE equal to the area BEIF, and AE is the space required. 97. The converse of this proposition, viz. If the areas are as the increments of the square of the velocily, the ordinates are, as the forces, is easily demonstrated in the same way; for if the elementary areas CDKG and EIM e represent increments of the squares oſ the velocity, the accelerating ſorces are in the ratio compounded oſ the direcet ratio of these rectangles, and the inverse ratio oſ their altitudes, because these altitudes are the increments oſ the space No 85.) Now the hase CG oſ the rectangle CDKG, is to the base EI oſ the rectangle EIM e in the same compounded ratio; thereſore the force in C is to the force in E as CG to EI. 98. The line h k o (fig. 13.) was called by Dr Barrow, who fſirst introduced this extensive employment oſ motion into geometry), the scaLu of velocities; and the line FHL (ſig. 16.) was named hy him the scale of accelerations. Hermann, in his Phoronomia, calls it the scale of ſorcess. We shall retain this name, and we may call h  o of fig. 13. the scale of accelerations, when the areas represent the velocitiess Newton added another scale oſ very great use, viz. a scale of times. It is constructed as follow. 99. Tet ABE (fig. 16.) be the line along which a body is accelerated, and let FHI be the scale of ſorces, that is, having its ordinates FB, HD, IE, &e. proportional to the ſorceſtaeting at B, D, E, F, &e.; let ſh i be another line 1 related to ABE, that C g is to EV in the inverse subduplicate ratio oſ the area BFGC to the area BFIE; or, b express it more generally, let the squares oſ the ordimtes to the line ſg i be inversely, as the arens oſ the line FHI intereepted between these ordinates and the first ordinate drawn through B; then the times of the bodies moving from a state oſ rest in B are as the intercepted ueas oſ the curve ſęi. For let CD and E e be two very small portions oſ the mace deseribed equal times. They will he ultimately as the velocities in C and E. The area FBCG is to the area FBEI as the square oſ E i to the square oſ C ⸗ (by construetion); but the area FBCG is to FBEI as the square oſ the velocity at C to the square of the velocity at E (by the proposition;) thereſore the square oſ the velocity at C is to the square oſ the velocity at E as the square of E i to the square oſ C 4; therefore E i is to Cg as the velocity at C to the velocity at E, that is, as CD to E e: but since E i: C g/CD: E, ve have Ei x E e =C g x CD, and the elementary rectangles C  k D and E i m e are equal, and may represent the equal moments of time in which CD and Ee vere described. Thus the areas oſ the line ſę l will represent or express the times oſ deseribing the corresponding portions of the abscissa. We may express the nature oſ this scale more brieſly thus. Let B E he the spuce descrihed with any varied motion, and fg I a curve, such that its ordinates are inversely as the velocities in the different points of the abscissa, then the area will be as the times oſ describing the corresponding portions oſ the abscissa. 100. In all the cases where our mathematical knowledge enables us to assign the values oſ the ordinates oſ the figure 16, we ean obtain the law oſ action oſ the ſorces, or the nature oſ the force; and where we can assign the value oſ the areas ſrom our knowledge oſ the pro- portions oſ the ordinates or forces, ve can ascertain the velocities of the motion. We shall give an example or two, which will shew the way in which we avail ourselve; of the geometrical properties oſ figure in order to ascertain the effects of mechanical forces. Ist. Let the accelerating ſorce which impels the body along the line AB be constant, and let the body be previously at rest in B; the line which bounds the ordinates that represent the forces must he some line ? HN parallel to AB. The area BDH ? is to the area BEN 9 as the square of the velocity at D to the square oſ the velocity at E. These areas, having equal hases DH and EN; are as their altitudes BD and BE. That is, the spaces described are as the squares oſ the acquired velocitiess And we see that this characteristic mark oſ uniformly accelerated motion is included in this general proposition. 101. 2d. Let us suppose that the body is impelled ſfrom A (fig. 17.) towards the point C, by a ſorce proportional to its distance ſrom that point. This ſorce may be represented by the ordinates DA, EB, e b, &e. to the straight line DCC We may take any magnitude of these ordinates; that is, the line DC may make any angle with AC. It will simpliſy the investigation iſ we make the fſirst force AD=AC. About C describe the cirele AH a, cutting the ordinate EB in F; let eb be another ordinate, cutting the circle in f very near to F; draw CH perpendicular to AC, and make the arch HA pFF, and draw he parallel to HC; join FC and DH, and draw F g perpendicular to ſb. Let IMLK be another ordinate. The area DABE is to the ares DAKL as the square of the velocity at B to the square oſ the velocity at . But DABE is the excess of the triangle ADC above the triangle EBC, or it is half oſ the excess oſ the square oſf CA or CF above the square of CB, that is, halſ the square oſ BF. In like manner, the area DAKL is equal to half the square oſ KM:; but halves have the same ratio as the integers; thereſore the square oſ BF is to the square of EM as the square oſ the velocity at B to the square of the veloeity at ; thereſore the velocity at B is to the velocity at K as BF is to KM. The velocities are proportional to the sines oſ the arches of the quadrant AFH deserihed on AC. Cor. 1. The final velocity with which the body arrives at G, is to the velocity in any other point B as radius to the sine of the arch AF. Cor. 2. The final velocity is to the velocity which the body would acquire by the uniform action of the initial force at A as 1 to v2; ſor the rectangle DACH expresses the square oſ the velocity acquired by the uniform action oſ the force DA; and this is double oſ the triangle DAC; thereſore the squares of these velocities are as and 2, and the velocities are as Vl and Vẽ, or as l to Vẽ. Cor. S. The time oſ deseribing AB is to the time oſf describing AC as the arch AF to the quadrant AFH. 102. For when the arch Fſ is diminished continually, it is plain that the triangle ſiF is ultimately similar to CFB, by reason oſ the equal angles Cib (or CFB) and siF, and the right angles CBF and ſFi; thereſore the triangles ſę F and CBF are also similar. Moreover, B, is equal to Fę, Ff is equal to h H, which is ultimately equal to c C; thereſore since the triangles fF and CFB are similar, ve have F : F  /FB: FCæPFB: HC; thereſore Bb is to c C as FB to HC, that is, as the velocity at B to the velocity at C; thereſore B b and c C are deseribed in equal moments when indeſinitely small; consequently equal portions Fſ,  H, oſ the quadrant correspond 1o equal moments oſ the accelerated motion along the radius AC; and the arches AF, FM, MH, e. are proportional to the times of describing AB, BK, XC, e. Cor. 4. The time oſ describing AC with the unequally acce lerated motion, is to the time oſ describing it uniſormly with the final velocity, as the quadrantal arch is to the radius oſ a circle; for if a point move in the quad- cuous employment oſ the mathematieal method oſ proceeding that we hove seleeted it. Instead oſ giving any more perticular cases, ve may observe in general, that if the intensity of the ſoree he proportioual 1o any power whose index is nI oſ the distance, and if  bo the distance from the ſixed point at which the body begins to bæ aceelerated, and æ its distance ſrom that point in any part oſ the motion, the velocity will be vVœ2æ. This is very pluin, because the inerement CGH D oſ the area of fig. 16. which is also the increment of the square oſ the velocity, is % and the area is  æ; and the whole area, corresponding to the distance a, is ?2. Therefore the portion oſ the area lying beyond the distance æ is &æ. This is as the square of the velocity, and thereſore the velocity is as the square root V oſ this quantity. This proposition, ſ7 v ò, or ſ æ, is the 39th of L the first book of Newtons Principia, and is perhaps the most important in the whole doctrine oſ dynamics, whether employed ſor the investigation of forces or for the explanation oſ motions. It furnishes the most immediate data for buth purposes, but more especially ſor the last. By its help Newton was able to point out the numerous disturbances oſ the planetary motions, and to separate them from each other; thus unravelling, as ſt were, that most intricate motion in which all are blended together. He has given a most wonderſul specimen oſ its application in his Lunar Theory. We now are able to explain all the puzæling facts which were adduced by Leibnitz and his partisans in support of their measure of the forces oſf bodies in motionn. We see why ſour springs, equally bent, communicate but a double velocity, and nine springs hut a triple velocity; why a bullet moving twice as ſast will penetrate an earthen rampart to a quadruple depth, &e. &e. This theorem also gives a most perspicuous explanation oſ the famous doetrine called conservatio virium vivarum. When perſeetly elastic hodies act on each other, it is found that the sum oſ the masses multiplied by the squares oſ the velocities is always the sume. This has been substituted, with great encomiums, by the German philosophers in place of Des Cartes's principle, that the quantity oſf motion in the universe, estimated in one direction, remains always the suame. They are obliged, huwever, to acknowledge, that in the actions of perſectly hard bodies, there is always a loss of vis vica, and thereſore have denied the existence oſ such bodiess. But there is the same loss in the mutual actions oſ all soſt or duetilo or even imperſectly elastic bodies; and they are miserably puZæled how to explain the fact: but both the consertatio and the amissio are necessary consequences oſ this theorem. In the collision of elastic bodies, the whole change oſ motion is produced during the short time that the bodies are compressed, and while they regain their figuree When this is completed, the hodies are at the same distance ſrom each other as when the mutual action began. Thereſore the preceding body has been accelerated, and the following body has been retarded, along equal spaces; and in every point of this space the accelerating and the retarding force has heen equal. Consequently the same area oſf ſig. 17. expresses the change made on the square oſ the relocity of hotlr bodiess. Therefore, if V and U are the velocities beſore eollision, and o and u the velocities aſter collision, oſ the two bodies A and B, we must have AxVi—5 DBxwV:, and thereſore Ax V4 Bx Uix / A xv 4 B æu. But in the other class of bodies, which do not eompletely regain their figure, but remain compressed, they are nearer to each other when their mutual action is ended than when it began. The foremost hbody has been accelerated along a shorter space than that along which the other has been retardedlc. The mutual forces have, in every instant, been equal and opposite Therefore the area which expresses the diminution oſ the square of the velocity, must exceed the area expressing the augmentation by a quantity that is always the same when the permanent compression is the same; that is, when the relative motion is the same. Ax V57 must exceed B x u? —U7, and A x Vè 4B x U? must exceed A x 0  B xu?. This same theorem is oſ the most extensive use in allpractical questions in the mechanical arts; and without it mechanies can go no ſarther than the mere statement of equilibrium. Hermann, proſessor oſ mathematies at Pavia, one oſ the ornaments of the mathematical class oſ philosophers, has given a pretty demonstration oſ this valuable proposition in the Acta Eruditorum Lipsiæ ſor 1709; and says, that having searched the writings oſ the mathematicians with great care, he ſound himselſ warranted to say, that Newton vas the undoubted author, and boasts of his own as the first synthetical demonstration. The purpose oſ this assertion was not very apparent at the time: but long aſter, in 1746, when Hermanns papers, preserved in the town-house oſ Pavia, were examined, in order to determine a dispute bet ween Maupertuis and Koenig about the claim to the diseovery oſ the principle of leust action, letters oſf Leibnitæ's were found, requesting Hermann to search ſor any traces of this proposition in the writings oſ the mathematicians of Europe. Leibnitæ was by this time the envious detractor from Newton's reputation; and could not but perceive, that all his contorted arguments ſor his doctrine received a clear explanation by means oſ this proposition, in perſect conſormity to the usual measure of moving ſorces. Newton had discovered this theorem long beſore the publication oſ the Principia, and even heſore- the discovery oſ the chieſ proposition oſ that book in 1666: ſor in his Optical Lectures, the materials oſ which were in his possession in 1664, he makes ſrequent use oſ a proposition ſounded on this (see No. 42.0 We may here remark, that Hermanns demonstration is, in every step, the same with Dr Barrows demonstration oſ it as a theorem merely geometrical, without speaking of moving ſorces (see Leet. Geometr. xi. p. 85. edit. 16.), but giving it as an instance of the transſormation oſ curves, which he calls scaLEs of velocity, oſ time, oſ acceleration, Ee. The two fundamental theorems ſſ =D?, and ſ =v?ò, enable us to solve every question oſ motion accelerated or. retarded by the action oſ the mechanical powers oſ naturee But the employment of them may be greatly expedited and simplified by noticing two or three geneꝶ”' cases which occur very ſrequently. 104. These may be called similar instunts of time, and sinilar points of space which divide given portions of time, and of space in the sume ratioo. Thus the middle is a similar instant of an hour or of a day, and is the similarly situated point oſ a ſoot or oſ a yard. The beginning oſ the 2lst minute, and oſ the 9th hour, are similar instants oſ an hour and of a day The beginning of the 5th inch, and oſ the 2d ſoot, are similar points oſ a ſoot and of a yard. 105. Forces may be said to act similarly when their intensities in similar instunis of time, or in similar points of space, are in a constant ratioo. Thus in fig. 17. when one body is impelled towards C ſrom A, and another from K, each with a force proportional to the distance oſ every point oſ its motion ſrom C, these ſorces may be said to act similarly along the spaces AC and KC, or during the times represented by the quadrantal arches AFH, KNO. The ſollowing propositions on similar actions will be ſound very useſul on many occasions; but we must premise a geometrical lemma. 106. Iſ there be two lines EFGH (fig. 18), e fęh, so related to their abscisses AD, a d, that the ordinates IK, i k, drawn from similar points I and i of the abscisses, are in the constant ratio of AE to a e; then the area ADHE is to the area a d he as the rectangle of AD x AE to the rectangle a d x ae. For let each abscissa be divided into the same number oſ equal and very small parts, of which let CD and cd be one in each. Inscribe the rectangles CGID, ecgi d. Then because the number of parts in each axis is the same, the lengths of the portions CD and c d will be proportional to the whole abscisses AD and a d. And because C and c are similar points, Cõ is to c as AE is to a e. Thereſore CD x CG: c d xeg =/AD AE: a d xace. This is true of each pair of correspunding rectangles; and thereſore it is true oſ their sums. But when the number oſ these rectangles is increased, and their breadth diminished without end, it is evident that the ultimate ratio of the sum oſ all the rectangles, such as CDHG to the sum of all the rectangles c d h  is the same with that of the area ADHE to the area o d he, and the proposition is maniſest. 107. If two particles of matter are similarly impelled during given times, the changes of velocity are as the limes and as the sorces jointly Let the times be represented by the straight lines ABC (fig. 19.) and a be, and the forces by the ordinates AD, BE, CF, and a d, bc, cſf. Then iſ B and b are similar instants (suppose the middles) of the whole times, we have BE: be =AD: a d. Thereſore, by the lemma, the area ACFD is to a c ſd as AC x AD to uc x ad. But these ares are proportional to the velocities (No. 72.), and the proposition is demonstrated. For the same reason, the change oſ velocity during the time AB is to the change during ab as AB x AD to ab æad. Cor. l. Iſ the times and forces are reciprocally proportional, the changes of velocity are equal; and if the ſorces are inversely as the times, the changes oſ velocity are equal. 108. If to particles be similarly urged along given spoces, the changes mude on the squares of the velocities are us the forces and spaces joinily. For iſf AC (fig. 19.) and a c are the spaces along which the particles are impelled, and ſhe forces are as the ordinates AD and ad, the areas ACFD and acſd are as the changes on the squares of the velocitiess But these areas are as AC x AD, and ac x adl. Thereſore, &e. Cor. 2. Iſ the spaces are inversely as the ſorces, the changes of the squares oſ ſhe velocities are equal; and if these are equal, the spaces are inversely as the forces. Cor. 3. Iſ the spaces, along which the particles have been impelled ſrom a previous state oſ rest, are directly as the ſorces, the velocities are also as the forces. For, because the changes of the squares oſ the velocities are as the spaces and ſorces jointly, they are in this case as the squares oſ the ſorces or oſ the spaces; but the changes of the squares oſ the velocities are in this case the whole squares oſ the velocities; thereſore the squares oſ the velocities are as the squares oſ the ſorces, and the velocities are as the ſorces. N. B. This includes the motions represented in fig. 17. 109. If tuo particles be similarly impelled along given spaces, from a stale of rest, the squares of the times ure proportional io the spaces directly, und to the forces inversely. Let ABC (fig. 19.) a b c be the spaces descrihed, and AD, ad, the accelerating forces at A and a. Let V, B express the velocity at B, and æ, b the velocity at b. Let GHK and g h  be curves whose ordinates are inrersely as the velocities at the corresponding points oſ the abscissa. These curves are thereſore exponents oſ the times (No. 99.) Then, because the ſorces act similarly, we have, hy the last theorem, AC x AD: ao c x a d vVæ, B: v', b, =l b: HB?. Thereſfore HB: h b æ Vacæad: VACZAD, and thereſore in a constant ratio. Call this the ratio oſ m to n. But, since the ordinates oſ the lines GHE, gh are inversely as the velocities, the areas are as the times (No. 99.); and since these ordinates are in the constant ratio of m to n, the areas are in the ratio of AC x m to a c x n. Thereſore (calling the times oſ the motions T and t) we have T: t m AC: nac; and thereſore T: tt =m x AC: n xauc. But m: nmn=ac xad: AC x AD. Therefore T: ti=acx ad x AC: AC x AD x ac, . Or T?: tim ad xAC: ADxac. AC ac OrT: t=T2T 2 The attentive reader will observe, that these three propositions give a great extension to the theorems which were formerly deduced from the nature of uniformly accelerated motion, or oſ uniform action oſ the ſorces, and were aſterwards demonstrated to obtain in the momentary action oſ forces any how variable. The first oſ the three propositions, V: o=FxT: ſxt, is the extension oſ the theorem ſfx i =6. The second, Va: ' 2F x S: f xs, is the extension oſ the theorem : . j s J i ſ ns =v v. And the third, T: t = 3 is the extension of f ꝶ or of ſ x (y =s. These theorems hold true oſ all similar actions; and only for this reason, are true oſ uniſormly accelerated motions, or uniſorm actions. There remains one thing more to be said concerning the uction oſ accelerating forces Their magnitude is ascer- tained by their effectt. Thereſore that is to be considered as a double ſorce which produces a double quantity oſ motion. Consequently when a hody A contains twice the number oſ equal atoms oſ matter, and acquires the same velocity from the action of the ſoree F that another hody a, containing half the number oſ atoms, acquires from the action oſ a ſorce ſ, ve conceive F to be double oſ . That this is a legitimate inference appears clearly ſrom this, that we conceive the sensible weight oſ a hody, or that pressure which it exerts on its supports, as the aggregate of the equal pressure, oſ every atom, accumulated perhaps on one point; as when the hody hangs hy a thread, and, by its intervention, pulls at some machine. Without inquiring in what manner, or by what intervention, this accumulation of pressure is :brought about, we see clearly that it results from the equal accelerating ſorce of gravity acting immediately on each atomm When this weight is thus employed to move another hody by the intervention of the thread, which is attached to one point perhaps oſ that body, it puts the whole into motion, generating a certain velocity v in every atom, by acting uniformly during the time t. We conceive each atom io have sustained the action oſ an equal accelerating ſorce, whose measure is Without considering how this force is exerted on each atom, or by what it is immediately exerted, or how it is diffused through the body from the point to which the weight oſ the other hody is applied hy means of the thread; we still consider it as the aggregate oſ the action of gravity on each atom of that other body. Moreover, attending only to the motion produced hy it, and perhaps not knowing the weight oſ the impelling body, we measure it, as a moving ſorce, by considering it as the aggregate oſ the ſorces propagated to each atom oſ the impelled body, and measured by æ Iſ we know that the impelled hody contains the number m oſ atoms, the aggregate oſ ſorces is m Y or n. But since we measure forces by the quantity of motion which they produce, ve must conceive, that when the same ſorce is applied to a body which consists of n particles, and produces the velocity u, by acting uniſormly during the same time ?, the foree n i equal to the v forcem T 110. Newton found it absolutely necessary to keep this circumstance of àcceleration clear of all notions of quantity oſ matter, or other considerations, and to contemplate the aſſections oſ motion only. He thereſore considered 7 as the true original measure of accelerating ſorce, and m 7 as an aggregatee. He thereſore calls the aggregate a vis motrix, a moving force, measured by the quantity of motion that it generatess. And he confines the term accelerating ſorce to the quantity measured by the acceleration or velocity only. It would be convenient, thereſore, also to confine the symbol ſtom . and to retãin the symbol a ſor expressing the accelerating force This appellation oſ motive ſorce is perſeetly just and simple; ſor we may conceive it as the same with the accelerating ſorce which produces the velocity m times » in one particle, by acting on it uniſormly during the time ſ. This motion of one particle having the velocity m », is the same with that of m particles having each the velocity æ. If therefore a motive foree ſ act on a body consisting oſ v m particles, the accelerating ſorce a is L m t Thereſore the three last propositions concerning the similar, the uniſorm, or the momentary actions of moving ſorees, when expressed in the most general terms, are, s  mr i  oroiæſ-. m m , ms t s5 s OF DEFLECYING FORCES. 11l. WuErS we ohserve the direction oſ a body to change, ve unavoidably inſer the agency of a foree which acts in a direction that does not coincide with that oſ the bodys motion; and we may distinguish this circumstance by calling it a nEvLECTING PORCEE. We have already shewn how to estimate and measure this deſlecting ſorce, by considering it as competent to the production oſ that motion vhich when compounded with the former motion, will produce the new motionn. No. 44. Now, as all changes oſ motion are really compositions oſ motions or ſorces, it ĩs erident that we shall explain the action of deſlecting ſorces when we shew this composition. We may almost venture to say a priori, that all, deſleetions must be continual, or exhihit curvilineal motions; for as no finite velocity, or change oſ velocity, can be produced in an instant by the action oſ an accelerating ſorce, nm polygonal or angular deſection can be produced: because this is the composiſion oſ a finite velocity produced in an instunt. Deſlective motions are all produced hy the composition oſ the ſormer motion, having a ſinite velocity, with a transversæ motion continually accelerated from a state of rest. OF this we can form a very distinet notion, by taking the simplest case of such aceelerated motion, namely, an uniſormly accelerated motion. voL. I. I 112. Let a body he moving in the direction AC (ſig. 20.) with any constant velocity, and when it comes to A, let it be exposed to the action oſ an accelerating ſorce, acting uniſormly in any other direction AE. This alone would cause the body to deseribe AE with a uniformly accelerated motion, so that the spaces AD, AE would be as the squares oſ the times in which they are deseribed. Thereſore, i AB be the space which it would have deseribed uniformly in the time that it describes AD by the action of the accelerating ſorce, and AC the space which it would have described uniformly while it deseribes AE by the action of the accelerating foreenothing more is wanted ſor ascertaining the real motion oſ the body hut to compound the uniform motion in the direction AC with the uniſormly accelerated motion in the direction AE. AD is to AE as the square oſ the time oſ describing AD to the 3quare of the time of describing AE; that is, as the square of the time oſ describing AB to the square of the time of deseribing AC; that is, as AB? to AC? (by reason oſ the uniform motion in AC). This composition is perſormed by taking the simultaneous points B, D, and the simultaneous points C, E, and completing the parallelograms ABFD, ACGE. The hody will be ſound in the points F and G in the instants in which it would have been found atB. and C by the uniform motion, or in D and E hy the accelerated motion. In the same manner may be ſound as many points of the real path as we please. It is plain that these points will be in a line AFG, so related to AE that AD: AE æ DF: EG'; or so related to the original motion AC, that AB?: AC' æ BF: CG, &. This line is thereſore a parabola oſ which AE is a diameter, DF and EG are ordinates, and which touches AC in A. Having thus ascertained the path of the body, we ean also ascertain the motion in that path; that is, the velocity in any point oſ it. We know that the velocity in the point G is to the velocity oſ the uniſorm motion in the direction AC as the tangent TG is to the ordinate EG; hecause this is the ultimate ratio oſ the momentary increment oſ the arch AFG to the momentary inerement oſ the ordinate EG. Thus is the velocity in every point of the curve determined. We have taken it for granted, that the line of projection touches the path, and that the direction in every point is that of the tangent. To suppose that the curve, in any portion of it, coincides with the tangent, is to suppose that the body is not deſlected; that is, is not acted on by a transverse accelerating ſorce: And to suppose that the tangent makes a finite angle with any part oſ the path, is to suppose that the deſection is not continual, but hy startsboth oſ which are contrary to the conditions oſ the case No straight line can be drawn between the direetion of the body and the succeeding portion oſ the path, otherwise ve must again suppose, that the deſlection is subsultory, and the motion angular. IIS. But while the investigation is so easy when the direction and intensity oſ the deſlecting ſorce in every point oſ the curve are known, the investigation oſ the deſlecting force ſrom the observed motion is by no means eassy. The observed curvilineal motion always arises from a eompo:ition oſ a uniſorm motion in the tangent vith somè transverse motion. But the same curvilineal motion may be produced by compounding the uniform motion in the tangent with an infinity of transverse motions; and the law oſ action will be difſerent in these transverse motions according as their directions diſſer. We must learn, not only the intensity oſ the deſleeting force, and the law oſ its variation, but also its direction in every point oſ the curve. It is not easy to find general rules for discovering the direction oſ the transverse ſorce; most commonly this is indicated by extrinsic circumstances. The deſlecting foree is ſrequently observed to reside in, or to accompany some other hody. It may be presumeq, thereſore, that it acts in the direction of the line drawn to or from that hody; yet even this is uncertain. The most generul rule for this investigation is to ohserve the place oſ the body at several intervals of time beſore and aſter its passing through the point of the curve, where we are interested to find its precise direetion. We then draw lines, joining those places with the places oſ the tangent where the hbody would have heen by the uniſorm motion only. We shall perhaps observe these lines of junction keep in purallel positions: we may be assured, that the direction oſ the transverse ſorce ĩs the same with that oſ any oſ these lines. This is the case in the example just now given oſ a parubolic motion. But when these lines change position, they will change it gradually; and their position in the point oſ contact is that to which their positions on both sides oſ it gradually approximate. But all this is destitute oſ the precision requisite in philosophical discussionn. We are indebted to Newton for a theorem whieh ascertains the direction of the transverse ſorce with all exactness, in the cases in which we most oſ all wish to attain mathematical accuracy, and which not only opened the access to those discoveries which have immortalised his name, but also pointed out to him the path he was to follow, and even marked his ſirst steps. Tt thereſore merits a very purticular treatment. 114. Iſ a body describes a eurve line ABCDEF (fig. 2l.) lying in one plane, and if there be a point S so situated in this plane that the line joining it with the body deseribes areas ASB, ASC, ASD, &e. proportional to the times in which the body deseribes the arches AB, AC, AD, &ec. the ſorce which deſlects the hody from rectilineal motion is continually directed to the fixed point S. Let us first suppose that the body describes the poly- gon ABCDEF, &e. ſormed oſ the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, &e. oſ this curve: and (for greater simplicity of argument) let us consider areas described in equal successive times; that is, let us suppose that the triangles ASB, BSC, CSD, &c. are equal, and described in equal times. Make B c  AB, and draw c S. Had the motion AB suffered no change in the point B, the body would have described Be in the equal moment succeeding the first: hut it deseribes BC The body has thereſore been deſlected by an external force: and BC is the diagonal oſ a purallelogram No. 45, 46.), oſ which B c is one side, and c C is another. The deſlecting ſorce will he discovered, both in respect oſ direction and intensity, by completing the parallelogram Be Cb. Bb is the space which the deſlecting force would have caused the body to describe in the time that it deseribes B c or BC. Beeause B c is equal to BA, the triangles BS c, BSA are equa. But (by the nature oſ the motion) BSA is equal to BSC. Thereſore the triangles BSC and BS c are equal. They are also on the same hase BS; therefore they lie between the same parallels, and Ce is parallel to SB. But c C is parallel to Bb. Thereſore B b coincides vith BS, and the deſlecting force at B is directed toward S. By the same argument, the deſlecting ſorce at the angles D, E, F, &e. is directed to S, Now, let the sides oſ the polygon be diminished, and their number increased without endc. The demonstration remains the same; and continues, when the polygon finally coalesces with the curve, and the deſlection is continual. When areas are described proportional to the times, equal areas are described in equal times; and thereſore the deſlection is always directed to S. Q. E. D. The point 58 may, with great propriety oſ language, be called the CcENTRE Oſ DEFLECTION, OF THE CENTRE OF roRCES; and forces which are thus continually directed to one fixed point, may be distinguished from other deflecting ſorces by the name CENTRAL FORCES. ſhe line joining the centre of forces with the body, and which may be conceived as a stiſſ line, carrying the hody round, is usually named the RADIUS VECTOR. 115. The converse oſ this proposition, via. that if the deſlecting forees be always directed to S, the motion is perſormed in one plane, in which S is situated, and areas are deseribed proportional to the timesis easily demonstrated by reversing the steps oſ this demonstration. The motion will be in the plane oſ the lines SB and Be; because the diagonal BC of the parallelogram of forces is in the plane oſ the sides. Areas are described proportional to the times; for Cc being parallel to SB, the triangles SCB and S c B are equal; and thereſore SCB and SAB are equal, &e. &e. 116. Cor. . When a bhody deseribes areas round S eopor liona to the times, or when it is continually deected toward S, or acted on by a transverse ſorce directed to S, the velocities in the difſerent points A and E of the curve are inversely proportional to the perpendiculars S r and S t, drawn ſrom the centre oſ ſorces to the tangents in those points; that is, to the perpendiculars ſrom the centre on the momentary directions oſ the motion: For since the triangles ASB, ESF are equal, their bases AB, EF are inversely as their altitudes S r, S I. But these bases, being described in equal times, are as the velocities; and they ultimately coincide with the tangents at A and E. 117. Cor. 2. If Bæ and F: be drawn perpendicular to SA and SE, we have SA x B. SE x F, and SA: SE =F.: B: For SA x B. is double oſ the triangle BSA, and SE x F, is double oſ the equal triangle SFE. 118. Cor. 8. The angular velocity round S, that is, the magnitude oſ the angle described in equal times by the radius vector, is inversely proportional to the square oſ ſhe distance ſrom S. For when the arches AB, EF are ſiminished continually, the perpendiculars B - and F. vill ultimately eoincide with arches deseribed round S vith the radii SB and SF. Now the magnitude oſ an mgle is proportional to ihe length oſ the arch which measures it directly, and to the radius of the arch inversely. Im any cirele, an arch oſ two inches long meaures twice as many degrees as an arch one inch long; mã an arch an inch long contains twice as many degrees oſ a cirele whose radius is twice as shortt. Thereſore, ultimately, the angle ASB is to the angle ESF as B - to F., and as SF to SB jointly; that is, as Bæ x SF to F:x SB. But Bæ: F:. =SE: SA (Cor. 2.). Thereſore ASB: ESF  SE x SF: SB x SA, æ ultimately SE?: SB®. This corollary gives us an ostensible mark, in many very important eases, oſ the action of a deſlecting force being always directed to a fixed pointt. We are oſten able to measure the angular motion when we cannot measure the real veloeities. Having thus discovered the chieſ circumstances which enable us to ascertain the direction of the deſlecting force, we proceed to investigate the quantity oſ this deſlective determination in the different points oſ a curvilineal motion. This is a more diſficult task. The momentary eſſect oſ the deſlecting ſorce is a small deviation from the tangent; and this deviation is made with an accelerated motion The law oſ this acceleration regulates the curvature of the path, and is to be determined by itt. We may be allowed to observe by the way, that it appears elearly from the form in which Newton has presented all his dynamical theorems, that we are indebted to these problems for the immense improvement which he has made in geometry by his invention of ſluxions. The purposes he had in view suggested to his penetrating mind the means ſor attaining them; and the connection between dynamics and goometry is so intimato, that the same theorems are in a manner common to both. This is purticularly the case in all that relates to curvature. We have seen how the curvature oſ a parabola is producœd by a ſorce acting uniformly. The momentary action oſ all ſinite ſorcos may be considered as uniſorm; and thereſore the curvature will he that oſ some portion of some purabola; but it will be diſicult to determine the precise degree without some ſarther help. We are best aoquainted with the properties oſ the cirole, and will have the elearest notions oſ the curvature of other curves by comparing them with cireles. The curvature oſ a circular arch of given length is so much groater as its radius is shorter; ſfor it will contain 50 many more degrees in the same length; and therefore the ęhange oſ direction oſ its extremities is so much greater. Curvatures may always be measured by the length oſ the arch directly and the radius inversely. 119. Suppose a thread made ſaust at one end oſ æ material eurve ABCD (ſig. 22) and applied io it in its whole length. Taking hold oſ it extremity Ih, unſold it gradually ſrom the curve DCBA; the extremity D will describe another ourve D c  . This geometrical operation is called the ævoLuTION of curves, and D c b a is called the EvoLuTE of DCBA, Which is called the invvoLvTE Of D c b . Perhaps this denomination has heen given from the genesis of the area or surface contained by the two lines, whioh is folded up and unſolded somewhat like a fan. When the describing point is in b, the thread b B is, undoubtedly, the momentary radius oſ a circle e b ſ, whose centre is B, the point of the involute which it is just going to quit. The momentary motion oſ b is the 30me, whether it is describing an arch of the evolute passing through b, or an arch of a circle round the centre B. The same line b ?, perpendicular to the thread b B, touches the circle e bſ and the eurve D b a in the point 5, This ile e  f must lie within the eurve D b  on the side of B toward u; hecause on this side the momentary radius contimually increasing For similar reasons, the circle b ſ lies without the curve on the other side oſ b BThereſore the circle e b ſ both touches and cuts the curvo Db a in the point 5 Moreover, hecause every portion oſ the curve between b and D is deseribed with radſli that are shorter than b B, it must bæe more incurvated than any portion of the eirele e b ſ, For similar reasons, every portion oſ the curve hetween b and a must he leas incurvated than this cirele; thereſore the circle has that precise degree oſ curvature that helongs to the curve in the point b; it is thereſore called the æQuICuRVE CIRCLE, OF the ci'ciE oF cURVATURE, and B is called the centre, and B b the RaADIUS OF CURVATURE. It is ęasy to perceive that no cirele can be described which shall touch the curvę in h, and come between it and the circle e b ſ: for its centre must be in some point ĩ of the radius b B. If i b be less than B b, it must ſall within the curve on both sides oſ b, and i i b is greater than B b, the circle must ſall without the curve on both sides of B hL. The cirele æ b ſ lies closer to the curve, has closer contact with it, than any other, and hns therefore goi the whimsieal name of oscuLaTING cincLE; and this sort oſ contact was called oscuLATION. This view oſ the genesis oſ ourve lines is oſ particular use in dynamieal discussions. It exhibits to the eye the perſect sameness of the momentary motion, ænd therefore of the momentary deſlection, in the curve and in the equicurve circle, and leaves the mind without a doult but that the ſorces which produce the one will produee the other. A gruat variety oſ curves may be deseribed in this way Iſ perpendiculars be drawn to the curve D ba in every point, they will interseet each other, each its immediate neighbour, in the circumſerence of ihe eurve DBA: and geometry teaches us how to find the curve DBA which shall produce the curve D b a by evolution. It is a matter worthy of remark, that the path of a body that is deſlected ſfrom reetilineal motion by a finite ſorce, varying according to any law whatever, may always be described by evolutionn. This includes almost every case oſ the action of deſlecting forces; none being excepted but when, by the opposite action oſ different forces, the body is in equilibrio in one single point oſ its path. Our task is now brought within a very narrow compass, namely, to measure the deſlection in the arch oſ a circle. Had the motion represented in fig. 2I. been polygonal, it is plain that the deſlecting ſorce in the point B is to that in the point E as the diagonal B b of the parallelogram ABC b to the diagonal E i of the parallelogram DEF i; thereſore let ABCZY be a circle passing through the points A, B, and C, and lel the radius vector BS cut the circumſerence in Z; drav AZ, CZ, and the diagonal AC, which neeessarily hisects and is hisected by the diagonal B b. The triangles b BC and CBZ are similar; ſor the angle C h B is equal to the alternate angle A Bb or ABZ, whieh is equal to ACZ, standing on the same chord AZ. And the angle CB b, or CBZ, is equal to CAZ, standing on the same chord CZ; thereſore the remaining angle b CB is equal to the remaining angle AZC; thereſore ZA is to AC as BC to Bb, and B6 u In like manner E i Duaæ : Nov let the points A and C continually approach, and ultimately coalesce with B; it is evident that the circle ABCZY is ultimately the equicurve or coinciding cirele at the point B, and that AS ultimately coalesces with, and is equal to, BS, and that ACXBC is ultimately 2BC?; therefore ultimately 2BC? EF: BC? EF: Bb: E i mJ/ |7 0= I8Z T5? Now BC and EF, heing described in equal times, are ithe velocĩties. B b and E ĩ are the measures oſ the dlocities which the deſlective ſorces at B and E would generate im the time that the body deseribes BC or EF, ud are thereſore the measures oſ those forcess. They are us the squares of the velocities directly, and inversely as those chords of the equicurve circles which have the directions of the deflection. Observe, that Bb or Eĩ is the third proportional to halſ of the chord and the arch described; ſor BS: BC =NBC: B2. It is evident, that as the arches AB, BC, continually diminish, AC is ultimately parallel to the tangent B r, and BO is equal to the actual deſlection ſrom the tangent. The triangles BOC and AOZ are similar, and BO  o ultimately BCWe may measure YAii Z the ſorces by the actual deſlections, because they are the halves of the measures oſ the generated velocities; and we may say that 120. The actuul momentary deflection from the tungent is third proportional to the deflective chord of the equicurve cirele and the arch described during the moment. Either oſ these measures may be taken, but we must take care not to confound them. The first is the most proper, because the change produced on the body (which is the immediate eſſect and measure oſ the ſorce) is the determmation, leſt inherent in ĩt, to move with a certain velocity. This is the measure also which we obtain by means oſ the differential or ſluxionary calculus; but the other measure must be obtained when our immediate objeet is to mark the actual path of the body. Thus have we obtained a measure of deſlecting force, and, in the most important cases, a method of discovering its direction. It only remains to point out the relation between the intensity oſ the force, the curvature oſ the path, and the velocity oſ the motionn. These three circumstanees have a necessary connection; fſor we see that the intensity is expressed by certain values oſ the other in the ſ la ſ æ Arch- U2BC Th two in the formule ſ  CE Chor,  / J3 . The deſlective velocity Bb is acquired in the time that the body descrihes BC; thereſore the deſlective velocity is to the velocity in the curve as B b to BC. The velocity B b is acquired by an accelerated motion along BO; for while, by progressive motion, the body describes BC, it deſlects ſrom the tangent through a space equal to the halſ of B b, hecause the momentary action oſ the deflecting force may be considered as uniform. The progressive velocity BC may be generated by the same ſorce, uniformly acting through a space greater than BC; call this space x. The spaces along which a body must be uniſormly impelled in order to acquire diſſerent velocities, are as the squares oſ those velocities; thereſore B &: BC B o: æ3 but Bb: BC=BC:  BZ; therefore Bb: BC' DBb: j BZ, and Bb: 4, BZ  Bo: x, and Bb: Bo à BZ: æ; but Bo is ; oſf Bb; thereſore æ is  of BZ: that is, I2l. The velocily in any point of a curvilineal paih, is that uhich the deflecting forces in that point would generate in the body by impelling it uniformly along one fourth part of ihe deſiective chord of the equicurve circlee Iſ the velocity increase, the chord oſ the equicurve circle must increase; that is, the puth becomes less incurvated. If the force be increased, the curvature will also increase, for the cho”d oſ curvature will he less. There is another general observation to he made on the velocity of a curvilineal motion, which greatly assists us in our investigations. 122. If a body describes a curve by the uction of a foree uliays directed to u fixed point, ond vurying according to any proportion whatever of the distances from that point, and if umother body, acted on by the same centripetul force, move touord the centre in a straight line, and if in any one case of equol distances from the centre of force the tio bodies have equal relocilies, they will huve equal velocities in every other case of equal distances from the centre. Let one hody be impelled from A (fig. 23.) toward C along the straight line AVDEC, and let another be deflected along the curve line VIKæAbout the centre C deseribe concentric arches ID, KE, very near to each other, and cutting the curve in I and K, and the line AC in D and E: drav IC, cutting KE in N, and draw NT perpendicular to the arch IK of the eurve, and complete the parallelogram ITNO. Let the hodies be supposed to have equal velocities at I and at D. Then, because the centripetal forces are supposed to he the same for hboth hodies when they ure at equul distances, the accelerating forees at D and I may be represented by the equal lines DE and IN; but the foree IN ĩs not wholly employed in accelerating the hody along the arch IE, but, acting transversely, it is partly employed in incurvating the path. It is equivalent to the two ſorces IO and IT oſ which only IT accelerates the body. Now IEN is a right-angled triangle, as is also the triangle INT; and they are similar; therefore IN: IT æ IK: IN, or DE: ITIK: DE: that is, the ſorce which accelerates the body along DE is to the ſorce which accelerates the body along IX as the space TX is to the space DE; thereſore No. 86.) the inerement oſ the square oſ the velocity acquired along DE is equal to the increment of the squnre oſ the velocity acquired along IX. But the velocities at D and I were equal, and consequently their squares were equal; and these having received equal increments, there- fore the squares oſ the velocities at E and X are equal, and the velocities themselves are equal. And since this is the case in all the corresponding points of the line AC and the curve VIE, the velocities at all equal distances from C will be equal. It is evident that the conclusion will be the same, iſ the bodies, instead of heing accelerated by approaching the centre in the straight line AC, and in the curve VIK, are moving in the opposite directions from E to A, or ſrom I to V, and are thereſore retarded by the centripetal force. 123. Cor. Hence it ſollos, that iſ a body be projeeted from any point, such as V, oſ the curve, in a line tending straight ſfrom the centre, with the velocity whieh it had in that point of the eurve, it would go to a distance VA, such, that iſ it were impelled along AV by the tentripetal ſorce, it would acquire its former velocity in the point V; also in any point hetween V and A it will have the same velocity in its recess from the centre that it has there in its approach to the centre: The line BLFG, whose ordinates are as the intensities oſ the centripetal ſorce in A, V, D, E, or in 4,V, I, X, may be called the scaLE Or EXPONENT Of ſorce; the areas bounded by the ordinates AB, VL, DF, EG, &e. drawn ſrom any two points oſ the axis, are as the squares oſ the velocity acquired by acceleration along the intercepted part oſ the axis, or in any curvilineal path, while the body approaches the centre, or which are lost while the body retires ſrom it. When we can compute these areas we obtain the velocities (see No. 102.) We are now in a condition to solve the chief problem in the science oſ dynamices, to which the whole oſ it is, in a great measure, subservient. The problem is this. Let a body be projected with a known velocity ſrom a given point and in a given direction, and let it be under the inſluence of a mechanieal ſorce, whose direction, intensity, and variation, are all known: it is required to determine its path, and its motion in this path, for any given time ? 124. This problem is susceptible oſ three distinot classes oſ conditions, which require a different investigation. I. The force may act in one constant direction; that is, in parallel lines. 2. The ſorce may he always directed to a ſixed point. 3. It may be directed to a point which is continually changing its place. lst, When the ſorce acts in parallel lines, the problem is slved by compounding the rectilineal accelerated motion which the ſorce would produce in its own direction with the uniform motion which the projection alone would have producedl. The motion must be curvilineal, when the accelerating force is transverse, in any degree whatever, to the projectile motion; and the eurvilineal path must be concave on that side to which the deſlecting force tends; for the force is supposed to act incessantly. The place of the body will he had ſor any time, by finding vwhere the body would have been at the end of that time by each force acting alone, and by completing the paralleſogram. Thus, suppose a body projected along AB (fig. 20.) while it is continually acted on by a force whose direction is AD. Let D and B be the places where the body would be at the end of a given time. Then the hody will, at the end of that time, be in F, the opposite angle oſ the parallelogram ABFD. But it has not described the diagonal AF, hecause its motion has heen curvilineal, as we shall find by determining its place at other instants oſ this time. The velocity in any point F is ſound by first determining the velocity at D, and making DT to DF as the velocity at D to the velocity at B (that is, the velocity oſ projeetion, because the motion along AB is uniſorm.) Then drawv TF. Then AB is to TF as the constant velocity of projection to the velocity at  We have seen nlready (No. 112I19.) that TF is a tangent to the curve in F. Hence we may determine the velocity at F in another vay. Having determined the form of the path in the way already described, by finding its different points, draw the tangent F d, cutting the line DA in d. Then the velocity at A is to that at F as AB to d F. Henee also we see, that the velocities in every point of the curve are proportional to the portion of the tangents at those points which are intercepted between any two lines parallel to AD. Either oſ these methods ſor ascertaining the velocity, in this ense oſ parallel deſlections, will in general be easier than the general method in No. I2l. by the equicurve circle: It was thus that Galileo distovered the parabolic motion of heavy bodies. 2d. We must consider the motions oſ hodies aſfected by centripetal or centrifugal ſorces, always tending to one fixed point. This is the celebrated inverse problem of centripetul forces, and is the 42d proposition of the first hook of Newton's Principiu. We shall give the solution aſter the manner oſ its illustrious author; because it is elementary, in the purest sense oſ the word, keeping in view the two leading circumstantes, and these only, namely, the motion oſ approach and recess from the centre, and the motion of revolution. By this judicious process, it becomes a pattern by which more refined, and, in some respects, better solutions should be modelled. At the same time we shull supply some steps of the investigation which his elegant conciseness has made him omit. 125. Let a body, which tends to C (fig. 24) with a force proportional to the ordinates oſ the exponent BLFG, having the axis CA, be projected from Vin the direction VQ, uith the velocity which the centripetal ſoree woulil generate in ĩt by accelerating it along AV. It b roquired to determine the path or orbit VIE oſ the hody, and ita place I in this orhit, at the end oſ the asigned lime T? Supposæ the thing dono, and that I ia the place oſ the hody. About the centre C, with the distancoa OV and CI, describe the cireles YV and ID. Draw CIX to the] circumſerence, and draw the ordinate DF oſ the exponent oſ forces, producing it toward æ, and produce the ordinate VL toward . Let Vi be the distance to which the body would go along the tangent VQ in the timo T, and joim tC Let this be supposed dono ſor every point of the curve. Let a i h and a x5 he two curves so relatod to the curve VIK, that the ordinate DF euts oſſ an area Va i D equal to the orbital seetor VCI, and an area VaxD qual to the eireular sector VOX. Then, hecause the velocity oſ projection is given, the distance V? is known, ani the avea oſ the triangle VC. But this is equal to the area VCI, hy the laws oſ eentrol ſorces (No. 11.) Thereſuro the area Va i D ia given Alsa, because the aręa VCI inereases in the proportion of the time, the area Va i D inereass at the samo ratę. Thereſore, haviug these subsidiary curv⸗ a i k, a æ the problem is solved as ſollos: Draw an ordinate D i, culting off an area Vai h proportional to the time, and deserihe a cireloe DIR. Thon draw a line CX, cutting oſſ a sectar VCX, equal to the urea Va x D cut off hy the ordinate Dix. This line will eut the circle DR in the point I, whioh is the point of the orbit that was demanded. Rut the ehieſ diſſioulty of the problem eonsists in tha deseription of the two subsidiary curves ę i b and a æy, into which the lines VIK and VXY are transſormei. We attain this construetion hy resolving the motion in thę uch oſ the orbit into two motions, one of which is in YOL. I. æ ; the direction of the transverse ſorce, or of the radius vector, and the other is in the direetion oſ revolution, or perpendicular to the radius. Let VE and IK be two very small arches deseribed in equal moments, and therefore ultimately in the ratio oſ the velocities in V and IT (No. 73.) Describe the circle KE, cutting IC in N. Draw EC and  C, and  n perpendicular to VC. IC x KN The element ICK oſ the orbit is 2 3IC x KN. This is equal to the element D i ſ E of the area Va i D, or to Di x DE, or to D i x IN. Thereſore IN: KN æ3 IC: D, or IN: ENZ IC: D, IC EN and Di 03 ĩi Now let Alfę be the exponent of the velocities, that is (N 856.), let VI! be to Dſ as ABLV to ABFD, or VI: Df =VABLV: VABFD. Make Vo and IV in the tangents respectively equal to VIand Dſ. Draw v u and iĩ o perpendicular to VC and IC, and v m perpendicular to EV produced. Let m ræ be an equilateral hyperbola, having VC, ZC, for its asymptotes, and cutting FD produced in . Then the ordinates Vm, Dr, are inversely proportional to CV, CD, or Vm: Dr æ CD: CV, æ CI: CV. But because the momentary sectors VC  and ICK are equal, kn: KN æ CI:: CV. Therefore, Vm: Dr=in: N , or to but Vo:VmæV: n and Ii (orDſ): Vo æIK: VE therefore Ii: Dr IK: KN but Ii: io= IK: EN, by similar triangles. Thereſore D r æ i o, and i o: Vm æ VC: CI. Also, hy similarity oſ triangles, Io: io = IN: EN, and 2 Io: io=2IN: KN. Now it was shewn, that in order that the space DibE may be equal to the space ICK, we must have REMARE. We have hitherto supposeũ that the velocity oſ projection is acquired by acceleration along AV. But this was merely for greater simplicity oſ argument, and that the final values of D i and D æ might be easier conceived. In whatever way the velocity is acquired, it will still be true, that when in any point Vwe make VI to Vm as the momentary increment VE of the arch is to the perpendicular n on the radius vector, we shall have in every other point, such as I, the line D to the line D as the increment IK of the arch tu KN. And in the final equation D f will still be expressed by Va t ſu x 126. Cor. 1. The angle which the path oſ the projectile makes with the radius vector is determined by this solution; ſor Ii is to io as radius to the sine oſ this angle; which sine is thereſore vr; 127. Cor. 2. When the magnitude æ is equal to vabl ſv I, the path is perpendiculur to the radius veetor, and the body is a tone of the apsides oſ its orbit, and begins to recede ſrom the centre aſter having approached to it, or begins to approach aſter having receded. 128. Cor. 8. The curvature of the orbit VIK is also determined in every point; ſor the curvature oſ any line is inversely as the radius of the equicurve cirele, and this is to the chord which passes through C as radius to the sine oſ the angle CIi. Because the velocity in any point Iis=VABPFD, und is equal to what the centripetal foree at I would produee, by impelling the hody along ; th oſ the deſlective chord oſ the equicurve circle, ve have this chord =4 An. Or we obtain it by taking a third proportional o the momentary deſlection and the momentary arch oſ the curve, or by other processes oſ the higher geometry, all proceeding on the quantities furnished in this investigation. 129. Such is the solution oſ this eelebrated problem given by Newton, who may justly be called the inventor of the seience oſ which it is the ehieſ result, as well as of the geometry, by help oſ which it is proseeutedl. We tannot give this glory to Galileo: ſor his simple problem oſ the motion oſ bodies afſected by uniſorm and parallel gravity, however just and elegant his solution may he, vas peculiar; and the same must be said oſ Huyghenss doetrine oſ eentriſugal ſorces. Besides, these theorems had been investigated by Newton several years beſore, as corollaries whieh he could not pass unnoticed, ſrom his general method This is proved by letters from Huyghens. 130. Whether we consider this problem as a piece ofſ mere mathematical speculation, or attend to its consequences, which include the whole oſ the celestial motions in all their extent and complication, we must allow it to be highly interesting, and likely to engage much attention in the period of ardent inquiry which closed the last eentury. Aceordingly, it was no sooner known, by the publieation oſ the Mathematical Principles of Nutural Philosophy in 1686, thun it occupied the talents oſ the most eminent mathematicians; and many solutions were published, someæ ol whieh diſffer considerably from Newton's; some are more expeditious, and better fitted ſor computation. O these, the most remarkahle ſor originality and ingenuity ure those of de Moĩivre, Hermann, Keill, aoud Stewart. The last diſſers most ſfrom the methods pursued by othere. M: Laurins propositions on this subject, and in that part oſ his ſluxions which treats oſ eurvature, are highly valuahle, classing the ehieſ aſfeetions oſ curvilineal motions geometrically, as they are suggested by the ſluxionary method; and then shewing, in a very instructive manner, the conneetion hetween these mathematical afſections of motion and the powers oſ nature which produce them. This part oſ his excellent work is a fine example oſ the real nature of all inquiries in dynamies; shewing that it difſers ſfrom geometry little more than in the language, in which the word force is substituted ſor aeceleration, retardation, or deſlection. We recommend the careful perusal oſ these propositions to all who wish to have clear conceptions oſ the subject. Dr John Keill and Dr Horsley (bishop oſ Rochester) have given particular treatises on the motions of bodies deſlected hy centripetal forces inversely proportional to the cubes oſ the distances: induced by the singular motions which result from this law oſ action, and ihe multitude oſ heautiſul propositions which they suggest to the mathematician. Newton, indeed, first perceived both oſ these peculiarities, and has begun this branch oſ the general problem. He fſirst demonstrated the description oſ the logarithmic and hyperbolic spirals, and indicated æ variety oſ curious recurring elliptical spirals, which would be deseribed by means oſ this ſorce, and shewing that they are all suseeptible oſ aceurate quadrature. Several of those authors aſſect to consider their solutions as more perſect than Newtons, and as more immediately indicating the remarkable properties oſ such motions; and also aſſeet to have deduced them from difſerent and original principles. But we cannot help saying, that their claims to superiority are very ill ſounded; there is not a principle made use oſ in their solutions which was not pointer out by Newton, and employed by him. The appearance of originality arises ſrom their having taken a more particular concern in some general property oſ curvilineal motions; such as the curvature, the centrifugal force, &e. and the making that the leading step oſ their process. But Newtons is still the best; because it is strictly elementary, aiming at the two leading circumstances, the motion to or ſrom the centre, and the motiòn of revolution round that centre. To these two purposes he adapted his two subsidiary curves. 131. Is it not surprising, that 25 years aſter the publicalion o Newton's Principia, a mathematician on the continent should publish a solution in the Memoirs oſ the French Academy, and boast that he had given the first demonstration of it? Yet John Bernoulli did this in 1710. Is it not more remarkable that this should be precisely the solution given by Newton, beginning from the same theorem, the 40th. I. Prin. following Newton in every step, and using the same subsidiary lines? Yet so it is. Bernoulli actually reduces the whole to two ſunetions; namely, / and a'c ll ab  ſe xæqc'æ j Q x CXæ same with Newton's x ABDVCZ2° Q. ton 3N ?is the same with  and Neto s AV ABFD2⸗ ; which last is plainly the because Newis the same with -ſ a bſo xa* c?, which Bernoulx⸗ li has changed into abx ſe xt  aè c? æ⸗. Bernoullis chieſ boast in this dissertation is, that no philosophers may he assured that the planets will always deseribe conie seetions; a truth oſf which they had not as yet received any prooſ; because, says he, Newton's argument ſor ĩt in the corollary oſ the 13th proposition is inconclusive, and because he had not heen able to accommodate his demonstration of the 4lst and 42d proposition to the particular case of the planetary gravitation. Newton's demonstration in the corollary oſ the 13th proposition is just, fourded on the principle on which the very demonstration of the 42d, adopted by Bernoulli, proceeds, and without which that demonstration is oſ no ſurcœ; namely, that a body, in given circumstances oſ situation, velocity, direction, imd centripetal iorbe, tan describe no other figure than what it really describes Newton did not accommodate the de monstration of the 42d propontion to the planetary motions, because he had already demonsrntod the natire oſ their orbits but mentions the case oſ a foreæ proportional to the reciprocal oſ the cubes of the distancè ; hot as a deduction ſrom the 42d, but because it wos mſ a deduction ſrom it, and admitted oſa very singular and beautiſul investigation by methods totally and essentially different. IS2. It cannot be expected that we can proceed to consider the various departments of this eelebrated problem. We nre only giving the outſmes oſ the general doctrines of dynamics; and we have bestowed more time on those which are purely elementary than some readers muy thirk they deserve. We were anxious to gve just conceptions of the fundamental principles oſ dynamics; Because we emow ſhat nothing else can entitle ĩt to the name oſ a demonstrative science, and because we see niuth indistinotness and umeertainty, and a general mgeness or vant oſ precision, in several elementary works which are put into the hands oſ persons entering on the study. This leads to errors of mere consequence than a person is apt to think; bevatis they æſfect our leading thoughts oſ mechunism itself, am our notions oſ *æ imtimãte nature oſ the visible universe. 138. Many very general doctrines oſ dynamics remain untouched; ull, nemely, thut relute to the rotutive motion oſ rigid hodies, and all that relate to the mutual action oſ bodies on each ther in the way of impulse. These subjects will be resumed in another part of this worE. Notwithstunding these omissions, ve must observe that no new principle remuins to be considered. We have given all that are necessary ; ani there is no question that occurs in the cases omitted, which cunnot he completely answered by means oſ the propositions alrendy established. We have taught how to discover the existence and agency oſ a mechonicnl ſoroe, to meauæ amd characterise it, and then to slate what will he its various eſfects, according to the circumstances of the ease. 134. Proceeding by these principles, men have discorereil m universai ſaet, that every atron of oue body on another is uccompanied hy an equal azarTòN of that other on the ſirst, in the opposit duection; that is, to express it in the lan guage oſ dynamics,  all the phenomena which  make us infer that the boily A pomessa a force by  which it changes the motion oſ the body B, shew, at  the sume ſime, that B pomeses a force hy which it  makes un equul and oppusite alterution in the motion s of A This, however, is not a doctrine oſ ahstract dynamivs: it doæes not ſlow ſrom our iden of ſoroœ; theresore it was not included in our list of the Lavs or uonox. ĩt is n part of the mechunival history oſ nature, just as the law oſ universal gravitation ĩs; und it might bæ called the law of umvER M ”EMCTION. Newton has, in or 2ppræhension, devinted ſrom his accustomeĩ logical necuracy, when he ndmits, as a third aviom or law of motion, that reaction is alvays oqual and ntrary to action ;t is a physioal lum, in as ſar as ſt is vbocrvd to obtain through the whole exiunt oſ the solur system. But Newton himueiſ did not, in the subsequent part oſ his vork, treat ũt as a logiml axiom; that is, as u law oſ hummm tlought with respeet 10 moſion: for he lubours to prove, biy fuct uni phetroutũon, thut it roally obtains through ſhe vhile extent of the solar system; and ĩ is n this disoovery that his hieſ clim to unequallod penetration and discernment appæars. 135. Availing ourselves oſ this ſact, we, with very litte trouble, state all the laws of impulsion. The body A, for example, moving to the westward at the rate oſ eight ſeet per minute, overtakes the double hody B, moving at the rate of four feet per minute What must be the consequence oſ their mutual impenetrability, and of the equality and contrariety of action and reaction? Their motions must be such that both sustain equal and opposite changes. They must give, in some way or other, this indication of possessing equal and opposite forces This will be the case if, vhen the changes are completed, A and B move on in contact at the rate of four feet per minute: for here A has produced in each half of B a change oſ motion two; and thereſore a totality of change equal to four. This is the eſſect, the mark, the measure, of the impulsive force of A; for it is the whole impulsion. B has produced in A a change oſ motion ſour, equal to the former, and in the opposite direction. This is the efſect, mark, and measure, oſ the repulsive force of A; ſor it is the whole repulsion. And this is all that we observe in the collision oſ two lumps oſ clay; and the observation is one of the ſacts on which the reality of the physical law of equal action and reaction is ſounded: and we can make no. ſarther inference from this fact. But the event might have been very different. A and B may be two magnets ſloating on corks upon water, with their north poles ſronting ench other We know, by other means, that they really possess ſorces by which they equally repel each otherr. The dynamical principles already established tell us also what must happen in this case. That both conditions of equal reaction and sensible repulsion may be ſulſilledl, A must come to rest, and B must move ſorward at the rate oſ ſour ſeet per minute. The same thing must happen in the meeting of perfectly elastic bodies, such as billiard balls. Iſ elastics are known to be imperſect in any degree, our dynamical principles uill still state the efſect oſ their collision, in conſormity 1o the law oſ equal reaction. 136. In like manner, all the motions oſ rotation are explained or predicted by means of the same principles oſ dynamics applied to the foree oſ cohesion. This is considered as a moving force, because, when the attraction of a magnet acts on a bit of iron attached to one end of u long lath ſloating on water, the whole lath is moved, although the magnet does not act on it at all: some other ſorce acts on it; it is its cohesion; which is thereſore a moving ſoree, and the subject of dynamical discussion. 137. And thus it appears that these subjeets do not come necessarily, nor, perhaps, with scientiſio propriety, under the eategory oſ dynamies, but are parts of the mechanical history of naturee Yet, did a work like ours give room in this place, the study oſ mechanical nature might be considerahly improved, by giving a system of such general doctrines as involve nò other notions hut those oſ ſoree and its measures, and the hypothesis oſ equal reaction. Some very general, nay universal, consequences of this comhination might be estahlished, which would greatly assist the mechanician in the solution of diſficult and complicated problems. Such is the proposition, that ihe mutual actims of bodies depend on their relative molions only, and require no knouledge of their real molions. This principle simpliſies in a onderſul manner the most diſſicult and the most ſrequent cases oſ action which nature presents to our view; hut at the same time gives a severe blow to human vanity, by ſorcing us to acknowledge that ve know nothing of the real motion of any thing in the universe, and never shall know any thing of it, till our intellectual constitution, or our opportunities of observation, are completely changed. 135. M. D'Alembert has made this principle still more serviceable ſor extricating ourselves ſrom the immense complication oſ actions thãt occurs in all the spontaneous phenomena of nature, by presenting it to us in a diſſerent form, which more distinetly expresses what may he culled the elements oſ the actions of bodies on each other. His proposition is as ſollows (sœœ his Dynamique, p. 7S.) :  In whatever manner a number of bodies change their motions, iſ we suppose that the motion which each hody vould have in the ſollowing moment, if it were perfectly free, is decomposed into two others, one of which is the motion which it really tukes in consequence oſ their mutual actions, the other will be such, that if each body were impressd by this ſoroe alone (that is, by the ſoroe which would produce this motion) the whole system of bodies would he ĩn equilibrio. This is almost slſ evident: ſor iſ these second constituent forces be not such as would put the system in equilibrio, the other constituent motions uld not be those which the bodies really take by the mutul nction, but would he changed by the ſirst. For example, let there be three bodies P, Q, R, and ſet the forces A, B, C, act on them, such as would give them the velocities y, ꝗ, r, in any directions whatever, producing the momenta, or quantities oſ motion, P æꝑ, Qx q, R xr, which we may call A, B, C, because they are the proper measures of the moving ſorce. Let us moreover suppose, that, hy striking each other, or by being any how connected with each other, they cannot tuke these motions A, B, and C, but reully take the motions a, b, and e. It is plain that we may conceive the motion A impressed on the body P, to be cumposed oſ ZThe motion a, vhich ĩt really takes, and oſ another motion . In like manner, B may be resolved into b, which it takes, and another à; and C into c and . The motions will be the same, whether. ve anet on P with the force A, or with the two ſorces o and ; whether we act on QQ vith the ſorce B, or with 4 and 4; and on R with the ſorce C, or with c and 2. Now by the supposition, ihe bodies actually take the motions a, b, and c; thereſore the motions æ, . and . must be such as will not derange the motions , b, and c; that is o say, that iſ the bodies had only the motions ., i, and  impressed on them, they would destroy each other, and the system would remain at rest. Mr D'Alembert has applied this proposition with great address and success to the very diſſicult questions that occur in the motions and actions oſ ſluids, and many other most difficult problems, such as the precession oſ the equinoxes, &c. The cause oſ its utility is, that in most cases it is not diſicult to find what ſorces will put a system in equilibrio; and combining these with the known extraneous ſorces whose effects we are interested to discover, we obtain the motions which really ſollow the mutual action of the bodies. This is not, properly speaking, a principle: it is a form in which a general ſact may be conceivedl. In the same way the celebrated mathematician De la Grange observed, that a system oſ bodies, acting on each other in any way, is in equilibrio, if there be impressed on its parts forces in the inverse proportion oſ the velocities which each body takes in consequence of their action or comnection; and he expresses this universal ſact by a very simple ſormula; and, calling this also a principle, he solves every question with ease and neatness, by reducing it to the investigation of those velocities In this way he has written a complete system oſ dynamics, to vhich he gives the title oſf Mechanique Analytique, ſull oſ the most ingenious and elegant solutions oſ very interesting and diſficult problems; and all this without drawing a line or figure, but accomplishing the whole by algebraic operations. i 139. But this is not teaching mechanical philosophy; it is merely employing the reader in algebraic operations, each oſ which he perſectly understands in its quality oſ an al gebraic or arithmetical operation, and where he may have the ſullest convietion of the justness oſ his procedure. But all this may be (and, in the hands oſ an expert alge braist, it generally is,) without any notions, distinet or indistinet, oſ the things, or the processes of reasoning that are represented by the symbols made use of. OF PROJECTILES, oR THE 5 MOTION OF SUELUNARY BODIES IN FREE SPACE. 140. In the process oſ our examination oſ the motions in the solar system, it appears that terrestrial gravity, or the heaviness oſ common sublunary hodies, is only a particular case of the mutual tendency oſ all matter towards all matter. It further appears, that a body on the surſace oſ our globe gravitates in a line that is directed very nearly to the centre oſ the earth; and that the intensity of this gravitation is inversely proportional to the square oſ its r ſrom this centre. Bodies let fall, or projected in any direetion on the surſace oſ this earth, move under the inſluence of this foree, and their motions may be computed from the general doctrines oſ dynamics in the same manner as we computed the motions oſ the planetss. They will either fall in the direetion of gravity, or will rise in the opposite direction, or will describe a curve line eoncave toward the earth, which will be an ellipsis, paraholie, hyperbolie, or a circle, aecording as the velocity and direetion oſ the projection may have been combined. But, in the greatest projections that we can make, the force oſ gravity is so nearly the same in every point of the path, that we may suppose it to be accurately so, without any sensible error, were it ten times greater than it is. Thereſore in all disquisitions about projectiles, it would be useless affectation to embarrass ourselves with the variations. None oſ our prqjectiles rise a mile in the air, which is about, ,55 oſ the mean radius oſ the earth, und will occasion a diminutivn oſ gravity nearly equal to 1v553: à quantity altogether insignificant: For the same reasons, although the directions oſ gravity in the diſſerent points of the projectile's Night, are lines converging nearly to the centre oſ the earth, we may consider them as all parallel, because none of our projectiles fly ſour miles, which produces a convergency oſ nearly four minutes,; a deviation ſrom parallelism which needs not be regarded. In general, thereſore, we may consiter ll such projetiles as under the inſluence oſ equal gravity acting in lines purallel to the vertical or plumh- line drawn through the place oſ projection. This reduces the theory oſ projectiles to a great degree oſ simpilicity. Accordingly, this is the first department oſ mechanical philosophy which first received improvement hy the application oſf mathematical knowledge. We are indebted ſor this ſortunate introduction oſ mathematics into the doętrines oſ motion, to the celebrated Florentine Galileo Galilei. This excellent philosopher read his discourses on local motion, ahout the beginning of the 17th cantury. Those lectures contain the whole of this doctrine, nearly in the state in which it continued till about the middle oſ lust century. Ihere is no branch oſ natural philosophy that has met with 50 much assistance and encouragement, it having been considered in all nations as the ſoundation of the art oſ gunnery; an art unſortunately too much connected with the security of every nation. It has theræ ſore heèn patronised by princes and magistratesmost costly establishments have heen made ſor its eultivation; the mathematicians have occupied themselves with its problems, and more numerous and expensive volumes have been published on this tham on any other part of mechanical philosophy. Yet there is none in which so little im provement has been made: Galileo's lessons contãin every thing that has heen done in a slentific way, till M. Robins in 1746 gave it a ſorm altogether new. I4l. We shall first consider the perpendieular aseents mi deseents of heavy bodies; and in ſhe next place their curvilineal motion when projected in direetions deviating from the vertical I4ã. The motion oſ a ſalling body is uniſormly accelemted, and that oſ a hody thrown straight upward, is uniformly retarded. For the accelerating or retarding ſorce is constant, and therefore the motions are such as were considered in urticles 50, &e. lI4ã. All the characteristic phenomena oſ ſhese motions having already heen sufficiently considered, all that is wanted for the application to this class of mechanical phenomena is merely one experimental determination oſ the accelerative power of gravity, that is, the velocity, or inerement of velocity whieh gravity will generate in a body by acting on it uniſormly during some given time. Galileo, who first demonstrated that an invariable gravity must produce a uniformly aecelerated motion, was also among the first who appealed to experiment in all inquiries We now think lightly of this, and wonder that a man shall think oſ another argument who has this in his power. But when Galileo began to communicate his know ledge to the world, this was the last support that a philosopher would think of. They had received a parcel oſ iopies ſfrom their master, whieh had been handed down in ihe shools during many ages; and ſrom these was every VOL. I. L thing accounted ſor or explained. Aristotle, or his immediate pupils, had said that the velocities of ſalling bodies increased with their weights; Galileos doctrine was incompatible with this, and he thought himself obliged to use orguments in his supportt. He said that if Aristotles doctrine be true, to crown pieces must ſall ſaster when sticking together than when unconnected, which, said he, is contrary to common experience Not doubting that he had convinced his audience, he deseribed the experiments which he was to exhibit next day, shewing that in a double time, a body would ſall four times as far, &e. The experiments were perſormed in the dome oſ the great church, beſore a vast concourse oſ people, and succeeded most perfectly. Yet s little were the philosophers moved hy this kind oſ argument, that they represented Galileo as a dangerous person, unſriendly to the state, and he was obliged to leave his native city in a few days, and take shelter in Padua. It is very remarkable that Baliani, one oſ the first geometers and mathematicians of that age, and who perſectly understood Galileo's speculations on this subject, should teach another doctrine, reviving, or supporting an old scholastic assertion that the velocity oſ a ſalling body might be as the space ſallen through, calling this motion also a uniformly accelerated motion. I44. Galileo found more diſficulty than one should expect in his endeavours to obtain an exact measure oſ the power oſ gravity, and indeed could not obtain one that was satisſactory. But the diſficulty oſ the task, and his struggle to accomplish it, were big with advantages to science. A body ſalls so ſast, that a considerable error in the conclusion arises ſfrom a very small error in estimating the time; and the great diſficulty was how to estimate the time. It was in this casting about for a measure oſ a small portion oſ time that Galileo first thought of the pendulum. His penetrating and sagacious mind enabled him to see that there must be a fixed proportion between the time oſ a vibration and that oſ ſalling through iĩts length, although his mathematical knowledge did not yet enable him to find it out; he sav an immediate consequence of this i true, namely, that the vibrations of two pendulums should be in the subduplicate ratio of the lengths, hecause this must be the proportions oſ the times oſ ſalling through those lengths (65.) This he would try; and he ſfound that it wàs so. Delighted vith this success, he immediately compared the time of ſalling frrom the top oſ the great dome with that oſ a pendulous vibration, by making a pendulum of such æ length that it peſormed precisely one vibration in the time of the fall. In this time, the body, moving with the final relocity, would describe a space double oſ that ſallen through. He then counted with patience the number oſ vibrations made by his pendulum in an interval of time, measured by the transit of two starss. Thus he obtained the time, and the velocity generated in that time by the uniform action oſ gravity. Galileo made this to he about 8l ſeet of our measure in a second, and said that it was tertainly somewhat more; beeause his experiments on ſalling bodies convinced him that their motion is retarded by the air. These efforts and resources of an ingenious mind are worthy oſ record, and are instructive to others. But Galileo did not attain the accuracy in this measure that we now possess. The honour of the accurate statement of the time oſ a pendulous oscillation, and that of the ſall through its length, was reserved ſor Mr Huyghens. This proportion was determined by him hy a most ingenious and elegant physico- mathematical process. He ulso gave us the pendulum clock, by which time can be measured with as much accuracy as a line can be divided. Aided by these inventions, ve have now obtained the most precise measure oſ the accelerating powers oſ gra- vity; and wè cin now say that its intensity is such in the latitude of London, that by acting uniſormly on a body ſor one second oſ time, it generates in it the velocity oſ 32 ſeet two inches per second, and a heavy body ſalls 16 ſeet one inch in that time. These are standard numbers, oſ continuãl use in all mechanical discussions, and should be careſully kept in remembrance Not only so, but we should acquire distinet notions of them in this respect, viæ. as standard numhers. Gravity is known to us in two ways; our most ſamiliar acquaintance ith it is as a pressure, which we ſeel when we carry a heavy hody. With this we ean compare the pressure oſ a spring, the exertion oſ an animal, the pressure oſf a stream of water or wind, the intensity oſ an attraction, &e. by setting them in opposition and equilibrium. The philosopher, and especially the physical astronomer, and cultivator oſ the Newtonian philosophy, is well acquainted with gravity as an accelerating and a moving ſorce, capable oſ accelerating, retarding, or deſlecting the body in which it inheres, or on whose intimate particles it aets without intermedium. He can compare the gravity oſ a stone with that oſ the moon, or of Jupiter, or with the ſoree that produces the precession oſ the equinoxes. The general mechanician, observing that all other pressures, such as that oſ a spring, oſ an animal, &e. are also moving ſorces, by combining those two aspects of gravity, makes a most important use of it by eomparing other forces with weights, and thence inſerring the motions which those ſorees will produce. Thus, knowing that an arrow ĩ oz. weight, by ſalling 18 inches acquires the velocity oſ 104 ſeet per second, he inſers, that when drawn to the head by a bow of 62 pounds, it will be discharged with the velocity of 233 ſeet per second. We shall thereſore, in ſuture, ecompare every ſorce with gravity, and express the accelerative power oſ this stan- dard by 39, meaning that by acting on every partiele oſ a body for a second, it will generate the velocity oſ 32 ſeet per seeond, and eause the hody to describe I6 ſeet vith a motion uniſormly acceleratedl We may find it convenient, on some occasions, to use the numbers 386, and 193, which are the inches in 327, and 16, ſeet. I4õ. The questions that interest us at present are those concerning the relations between the time, i, of any ſall, the height, h, oſ that ſall, and the velocity, , that is uniformly acquired in ſalling; so that when any one of those things is given, the others may he ſfound out. I. Since the variations oſ velocity are proportional to the times in which they are produced, we have I:  =æ232gQ: 3]:\ and v 3S2t v EEN N. B. The time ? is always supposed to be a number of seconds, and the height h a number oſ feet, and the velocity æ a numher of feet uniformly moved over in one second. : A fſalling body thereſore acquires an inerement oſ 32 ſeet per second in every second oſ its ſall, and an ascending body has its velocity lessened as much during every second of its ris. A hody falling during ſour seeonds acquires the velocity oſ 128 ſeet per second. But if the body has been projected downward, with the velocity of I00 ſeet per second, then, at the end of 4, it is moving at the rate of 228 feet per second. A body projected straight upwards with the veloeity oſ 160 ſeet per second, will at the end oſ the first second of its rise, have the velocity 128. At the end of  it will be moving at the rate oſ 96 feet per second. Its velocity at the end oſ the third second will he 64. At the end oſ the fourth seeond it will be 32, and at the end oſ five seconds it will stop, and hegin to ſall. and The times oſ the rise and the subsequent ſall are equal. 146. II. Since the heights are as the squares of the times oſ the ſall or ascent, we have l: t æ16: 1610 and h  I6t and vh 4ti also ? E and t = vA heavy body, falling during ſour seconds, ſalls 256 ſeet. A body rising straight upwards 144 ſeet employs S seconds in its ascent. 147. III. Because the heights ſallen through are also proportional to the squares oſ the velocities acquired at the end oſ the ſall, we have 320: v =I6: h 16 4 v and  æ 55 V, and Vi =g  mF and, conversely, o =8 Vh, and v?  G4 h. 148. All questions concerning the perpendiculer ascents and descents oſ heavy hodies may be solved by means of the two equations v=Dt=qu™t hæ 1615,  igte An easy mode oſ extempore computations is had, by remarking that since a heavy body ſalls 16 ſeet in a second, and acquires the velocity 32, it ſalls I foot in ,th of a second, and acquires the velocity D. In every second oſ the ſall, the velocity is increased by 32and in every ſoot oſ the ſall, the square oſ the velocity is increased by 64. In many questions, particularly in hydraulies, it is convenient to have the measures in inches. 149. Now, V 703: vV Tæ 386: 21,785. Thereſore a heavy hody by fſalling one inch acquires the velocity 27,755 inches, or nearly 273 inches per second. 150. Did gravity impel a body uniſormly along a space tqual to the radius oſ the earth, it would generate the relocity, which would enable the hody to deseribe a parabola, having the centre of the earth ſor its focus. If projected straight upwards with this velocity, it would never return. 15. Now V76: / Earii's rad. = 32: 36, 680 ſeet. This is the velocity now spoken oſf. Suppose the earth uniſormly dense, and a pit to the centree A heavy body vould acquire, by falling down this pit the velocity 25,866. Greater velocities than either oſ these ean be produeed by forces which we know. Aurum fulminans expands with the velocity oſ at least 42 miles per second. It does not seem necessary to insist further on the rectilineal ascents and descents of heavy hodies, and thereſore we proceed to consider their eurvilineal motions, vhen projected in any direction that deviates ſrom the perpendieular. These are the motions which are understood to form what is called PrROIECTILES. 152. These motions are not only interesting to the philosophical mechanist, as examples oſ a constant deſlecting ſorce, and a uniſorm deſlection in parallel lines, but also to the artillerist; because the motion oſ shot and shells are cases oſ this question, which comprehend the vhole oſ his artt It has thereſore been very much cultivated; and there is no branch of mechanical philosophy on which 50 much has been written, or so many experiments made ſor its improvement. The experimental cultivation of this branch could searcely be prosecuted by private persons; but, in all the states of Europe, there are public establishments ſor this purpose, and no expence has been spared for bringing to perſection an art in which the ſate of nations has unfortunately much dependence. But, notwithstanding this liberal encouragement, and the numberless volumes which have been published on the ubject, it cannot be said to have improved much as a science since it came out oſ the hands oſ its inventor, and his immediate pupil Tartaglia; and we shall be greatly disappointed iſf we look ſor that nice agreement between the results of the most approved theory and what we observe in the ſlight oſ great shot and shells The theory, however, is unexceptionable; and the enormous deviations that we see in the actual perſormance of artillery, is owing to the resistance oſ the air. This was long considered as insigniſicant, even aſter Newton had given us sufficient inſormation to the contrary. But the gentlemen of the proſession made little aceount of the speculations of a private philosopher, and continued to regulate their theories by notions of their ovn. They have been ab last convinoed oſ their mistake by the curious experiments and diseoveries of Mr Rohins, and are improving their practice in some measure But we now find, that the theory oſ the motion of heavy hodies through a resisting ſluid, is one of the most abstruse and diſficult tasks that the mechanician ean take in hand. At present, we are about to consider this subject morely as a particular case of motions regulated by gravitation, reserving the particular eonsideration of the modifications oſ these motions by the resistance oſ the air, till we shall have made ourselves acquainted with the general laws of such resistance. 153. Let a hody (Plate II. fig. 1.) be projected in any direetion AB, which deviates from the vertical AW. Then it would move on in this direction, and in equal sueceeding moments would deseribe the equal spaces A, BH, HI, IK, KL, &. But suppose, ſhat when the hody is at B it receives an instantaneous impulse in the direetion oſ the vertical B, such that by this impulse it would describe the line B b uniformly in the same time that it would have continued its motion along BH. Or, to speak more accurately, let the motion or velocity Bò be compounded with the motion BE. The hbody must describe the dia- gonal BC oſ a parallelogram BS CH, and, at the end of this seeond moment, it must be in C, ĩn the vertieal Iine HCC, and moving with the velocity BC. Thereſore, in the third moment it would deseribe CN, equal to BC. But let another impulse in the direction oſ the vertieal CC generate the velocity Co, equal to B5. By the composition of this with the motion ON, the body will deseribe the diagonal OD oſ the parallelogram C o DN, and at the end oſ the third moment must be in D, moving in ihe direction and with the velocity CD. It would deseribe BO equal to CD in the ſfourth moment. Another impulsæ of gravity D d, in the vertical, and equal to either oſ the ſormer impulses, will make the body describe DE; and an equal impulse E e will deſleet the hody into EF; and another impulse F f will deſlect it into FG, &e. Thus it is plain that the body, hy the composition of these equal and parallel impulses, will describe the polygonal figure ABCDEFG, all in one vertieal plane, and in every instant or point, such as E, will be found in the vertical line KE, drawn ſfrom the point at which it would have arrved in that instant by the primitive proon. Now, let the interval hetween these impulses be diminished, and their number be increased, without end. It is evident that this polygonal motion will ultimately coincide with the motion in a path of continued eurvation, by the eontinual and unvaried action of gravity. The line described by the body has evidently the ſollowing properties. 154. Ist H a number oſ equidistant vertical lines BR, HCC, IDIY, KEE, &c. be drawn, cutting the curve in B, C, D, E, &c.; and if the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, &e. drawn through the points oſ intersection, be produeed till they cut the verticals in H, N, O, P, &e. the intercepted portions HC, ND, OE, PF, &e. are all equal. 155. %d. The curve is a parabola, in which the vertieals BB, CC, &e. are diameterss The property mentioned in the last paragraph belongs exclusively to the parabola. As the circle is the curve oſ uniſorm deſlection in the direction of the radius, so the parabola is the curve oſ uniform deſlection in the direction of the diameter. Thatthe curve in which the chords drawn through the intersection of equidistant verticals cut off equal portions of these vertioals is a parahola, is easily proved in a variety oſ vays. Since Bb, Cc, D d, Ee, are all equal, and the verticals are equidistant, B c d E must be a straight line. So must Cde F; BE must be parallel to CD, and CF ſo DE. Thereſore BF and CE are parallel, and are bisected in m and o by the vertical DY. Also, if FC be produced till it meet the next vertical in i, i B is equal to Dm. All this is very plain. Hence iB, or Dm: dnmæ BF: m F, =/ m F: oE; but dm: Do mF: oE; thereſore Im: Do mF?: oE?; and D, E, F, are in a parabola, of which Dm is a diameter, and o E, m F are-semiordinatess. We should prove, in the same manner, that BG is parallel to CF, and AG to BF, and D m: DIV =mnF: D'G2 and the points D, F, G, in the same parabola. 156. Thus we have demonstrated, that the equal and purallel impulse of gravity produces a motion in a parabola whose diameters are perpendicular to the horizon. This was the great discovery oſ Galileo, and the finest example oſ his geniuss. Hĩs discoveries in the heavens have indeed attracted more notice, and he is oſtener spoEen of as the firat person who shewed the mountains in the moon, the phases of Venus, the satellites oſ Jupiter, &c. But in all these he was obliged to his telescope; and another person who had common curiosity would have seen the same things. But, in the present discovery, every step was an effſort oſ judgment and reasoning, and the whole investigation was altogether novel. No attempt had been made, since the first dawn oſ mechanical science, to explain a curvilineal motion oſ any kind: and even the law of the composition of motion, though ſaintly seen by the ancients, had never been applied to any use (except by Stevinus) till this sagacious philosopher saw ils immense importance, and brought it into constant service. 157. The process employed by Galileo in this investigation, and which has been copied by almost all the writers on the subject, ĩs considerably difſerent ſfrom the one now gone through. Galileo supposes the heavy hody to fall in the vertical BB with a uniformly accelerated motion, desribing spaces as the squares of the times. He supposes this motion to be compounded with the uniform motion in the direction oſ the tangent BRD Then, supposing that B ? and BT are ſallen through while Br and BR are deseribed by the motion oſ projection, it follos, that because B7 is 1o BR as the time of deseribing Br to the time of describing BR, we shall have Bt: BTEBE: BR®. Thereſore, completing the parallelograms B: Cr, BTSR, ve have Bt: BT 1t C: TS, and the points B, C, S, ue in a parabola, whose diameter is BT, and has BR a langent in B. No doubt, the result oſf these suppositions agrees perſectly with the phenomena, and gives a very easy and elegant solution oſ the question. But, in the first place, it is more difficult, or takes more discourse, to prove this continued composition of motion (almost peculiar to the case) than to demonstrate the parabolic figure: and, secondly, it ĩs not a just narration oſ the fact of the procedure of naturee. There is no composition of such motions as are here supposedlc. When the hody is at C, there is not a motion in the direction parallel to B7, compounding itselſ with a motion in the vertical, having the velocity which the ſalling body would have as it passes through the point t. The body is really mòving in the direction CS oſ the tangent to the parahola, and it there receives the same infinitesimal impulse oſ gravity that it received at B. Its deſlection, thereſore, ſfrom the line oſf its motion, does not make any ſinite angle with that motion. Therefore, although Galileo's demonstration does very well for a mere mathematical process, like the navigators calculation oſ the ship's place hy tables oſ difference oſ latitude and departure, it by no means answers the purpose oſ the philosophical investigation oſ a natural phenomenon. The method we have followed is a bare narration of the factsconsidering the motion oſ the body in every instant as it really is, and stating the force then really aſfeeting its motion. We have not scrupled to make use o? the method employed by Newton in the demonstration oſ his ſundamental proposition on curvilineal motions, first conceiving the action oſ gravity to be subsultory, and the motion to be polygonal, and then inſerring a similar result from the uninterrupted action oſ gravity. But iſ any person is so ſastidious as to ohjeet to this, (as John Bernoulli has done to Newtons method,) he may remark, that the motion B b which we compared with BH, in order to produce the motion BC, is just double of the space B, through which the hody ſalls during the motion along BH. Thereſore the ſigure will be such that the curvilineal deflection will be one half oſf B b, or of HC, and the tangent to the curve, whatever it is, will bisect HC. Then, during the next moment, sinee the deſlective action of gravity is supposed the same, the body will be as much deſlected from its path in C, that is, from the new tangent CS, whatever direction that tangent may have, as it was in the preceding moment. This gives us  D equal to r C, and this obtains throughoutt. Without entering on any discussion on the progress oſ the deſleetion in the difſerent points of the areh BC or CD, it is enough for our purpose to shew that the curve deseribed is such that when equidistant verticals are drawn, and tangents drawn through their intersections with the curve, the portions of the verticals cut oſf by the tangents are ererywhere equal. This also is a property of the parabola extlusively. That BCD is a parabola, of which BT is a diameter, and BR a tangent, is easily seenn For, drawing D u parallel to BR, it is plain that  N2°rC, and ND æ/22..:D, 2r C. Thereſore v DæA4*~P rC, and Bu ~ B, and Bt: Bu 1t6 C?: u D?. And we should prove, in the same manner, that v E9 r C, &e. Having thus ascertained the general nature oſ the path oſ a projectile, ve must now examine its motion in this path, determining its velocity in the difſerent points, and the time employed in the description oſ the archess. For this purpose we must ſirst ascertain the precise parahola described under the conditions oſ the projection, that is, depending on its direetion and velocity. To do this in a way naturally eonnected with the acting forces, we shall consider the velocity oſ projection as having been generated by ſalling through some determinate height. 155. Let us thereſore suppose that the hody is projeeted ſrom B, in the direction BR, with the velocity nequired by ſalling through the vertieal VB. Make BT equal to VB, and BR equal to VT or 2 VB, and, lastly, draw TS parallel to BR, meeting the parabola in S. It is plain that BR is the space whieh would be uniſormly deseribed with the velocity oſ projection in the time oſf ſalling through VB. Also Br is the space that would be uniſormly described, with the same velocity, in the time oſ ſalling through Bt. Thereſore BR is 1o Br as the time oſ ſalling through VB to that of ſalling through Bt. But, since BT is equal 1o VB, Br is to BR as the time oſ falling through Bſ to the ume oſ ſalling through BT. Thereſore BR is to B æ as the time oſ ſalling through VB to that of ſalling through B. But, since BT is equal to VB, Br is to BR as the time oſ ſalling through B? to the time oſ ſalling through BT. Therefore ve have Bt: BTDBr?: B*. But. in the purabola, we have Bi: BT æt C*: TS?, æBr?: TS⸗. Therefore TS is equal to BR or to twice VB or BT. Thereſore TS? æ 4 BT?, 4 BT x BV, æBT x4 BV. But, in a parabola, the square of any ordinate TS is equal to the rectangle of the absciss BT and the parameter oſ that diameter. Thereſore 4 VB is the parameter oſ the diameter BT, and VB is the ſourth part oſ that parameter. If, thereſore, the horizontal lin VZ he drawn, it is the directrix oſ the parabola deseribed by a hody projected ſfrom B in any direction; with the velocity acquired by ſalling ſrom V. 159. Cor. I. As this is true ſor any other point, C, D; &e. it ſollows that the velocity in any point of the path is that which a heavy body would acquire by ſalling from the directrix to that point —N. B. This agrees with the determination given in Art. 121. in the most general terms, ſor curvilineal motions of every kind. For it is well known that the equicurve cirele passing through the vertex of any diameter of a parabola, cuts off a chord equal to its parameter. Now this is evidently the deflective chord in the present case, because the diameters ure all vertical lines, in the direction of gravity. It agrees equally with the determination given in Art. 122. 160. Cor. 2. Hence also we learn that the velocities in any two points, such as B and D, are proportional to the portions v 5 and Dt oſ the tangents through those points which are intercepted by the same diameters Thus, vy is a portion oſ the tangent B4, intercepted by the diameters DDV and EE,, which also intercept a portion oſ the tangent Dt. For these portions oſ tangenis are in the subduplicate ratio of the lines VB and ZD:. Now the velocities acquired by ſalling through VB and ZD are in this subduplicate ratio oſ the spaces ſallen through. I6. Such is the Galilean Theory oſf the parabolic motion oſ projectiles, a doctrine valuable ſor its intrinsic excellence, and which will always be respectable among philosophers, as the first example oſf a problem in the higher department of Mechanical Philosophy. We are now to consider it as the ſfoundation of the art oſf gunnery. But it may be affirmed, at setting out; that the theory is oſ very little use for directing the practice of cannonading. Here it is necessary to approach as near as possible to the object, and the hurry of service allows no time for geometrical methods of pointing the piece aſter each discharg. When the gun is within 300 yards oſ the object, the gunner points it straight on it, or rather a little above, to compensate for the small deſlection which obtains, even at this small distance. Sometimes the piece is elevated at a small angle, and the shot, discharged with a very moderate velocity, drops on the ground, and bounds along, destroying the enemy's troops. But, in all these eases, the gunner is directed entirely hy practice, and it cannot be said that the parabolic theory is oſ any service to him. Its principal use is ſor directing the bombardier in the throwing oſ shells With these it is proposed to destroy buildings, to break through the rooſs oſ magazines, to destroy troops, by bursting among them, &e. Such objects, being generally under cover of the works oſ a place, cannot be hit by a direct shot, and thereſore the shells are thrown with such elevated directions that they get over the works, and produce their efſect. These shells are oſ great weight, sometimes exceeding 200 Ib. The mortar ſfrom which they are discharged must be exceedingly strong, that it may resist the explosion of the powder able to impel this vast mass to a great distancee They are thereſore most unwieldy, and it is found most convenient to have them almost solid, and unchangeable in their positlion. The shell is thrown to the intended distance by em- ploying a proper quantity oſ powder. This is found incomparahly easier than to vary the elevation oſ the mortar. We shall also find, that when a proper elevation has been selected, a small deviation ſrom it, unavoidable in such service, is much less detrimental than iſ another elevaſion had heen chosen. Mortars, thereſore, are ſrequently cast in one piece with their bed or carriage, having an elevation that is not ſar ſrom being the best on all ordinary occasions, and the rest is done by repested trials with difſerent charges of powder. Still, however, in this practice, the parabolic motion must be understood, that the bombardier may: avail himselſ of any occasional circumstance that may he oſ advantage to himm. We shall thereſore eonsider the ehief problems that the artillerist has to resolve, hut with the utmost brevity; and the reader will s00n see, that more minute discussion would be oſ very little service. 162. The velocity oſ projection is measured by the ſall that is necessary ſor acquiring it. It has generally been called the force, or irETUS; We shall distinguish it by the symbol ſ. Thus, in Plate II fig. 2, S3, 4, FA is the height through which the body is supposed to ſall, in order to acquire the velocity with which it is projected ſrom A. The distance AB between the piece of ordnance and the object, is called the AupLITUDE, and also the range r. Let the angle EAB contained between the vertical and the direction of the object be ealled the avoLæ OF POsoNn, /). And let the angle DAB contained between that direction and the axis of the piece, be called the direetion of the mortar =d, and let 2 express the zenith distance or angle EAD, contained between the axis oſ the mortar and the vertical line AE. : The leading problem, ſrom which almost all the others may he derived, is the ſollowing. 168. Let a shell be thrown ſrom A (fig. 3S, 4), with the relocity required by ſulling through the vertical FA so as to hit an ohject B. Required the direction AD oſ the projection. Let AH be a horizontal line, and AB the line oſ position oſ the object. In the vertical AF, take AE æ4 AF, md on EA describe an arch oſ a cirele ED d A, whieh shall touch the line of position AB. Draw through the object the vertical line BD, cutting the circle in D and d, and join AD and Ad. I say that AD or Ad are the directions required. Join ED and E d. For, because AB touches the cirele in A, the angle ADE is equal to the exterior angle EA a, or DBA, and the alternate angles EAD, ADB are equal. The triangles ADB iid EAD are thereſore similur, and DB: DA æ DA: AE, ui DA? =DB xX EA. Phereſore B is in a parabola, of whicli the vertical AT is a diameter, AD a tangent in A, and AE the parameter oſ that diameter. If, thereſore; the hody be projected ſrom A in the diretion AD, with the velotity acquired by ſalling through FA, the fourth pert oſ this parameter, it will deseribe a parabola AVB which passes through B. By the same reasoning, it is demonstrated that the body will hit the mark B, iſ projected in the direction Ad with the same velocity, describing the parubola A v B. From this very simple construetion, ve may draw several very instructive corollaries. 164. Cor. 1. When the vertical line passing through B cuts the circle EDA, it always cuts it in two points D and i, giving two directions AD and A d, either oſ which will solve the problem. Cor. 2 But iſ the vertical through b only toueh the tirele, as it touches it in one point only, it gives hut one direetion, along which the body must be projected to hit the mark b This direction is AG. 165. Cor. 3. The direction AG evidently bisects the von. I. M angle EAB, and the directions AD and A d are equidistant ſrom the middle direction AG. 166. Cor. 4. If the vertical passing through B do not meet the circle described on AE, according to the conditions specified, the ohject is too remote to be struck by a body projected from A with the velocity acquired by ſalling ſrom F. There is no direction that will enable it to go s0 far on the line AB. The distance Ab is the greatest possible with this velocity, and it is attained by taking the elevation AG which bisects the angle EAB. We may thereſore call Ab the maximum range on the line AB, and AG the middle direction. 167. Cor. 5. The distances on a givęn line oſ position to which a body will be projected in a given direction AD, are proportional to the squares oſ the velocities oſ projection. For the figure being similar, the range AB has the same proportion to AF, the ſall necessary ſor acquiring the velocity. Now the ſalls are in the duplicate ratio of the velocities required by falling. Therefore, &e. The converse of this problem is solved with the same ſacility of construction. 168. Let a body be projected in the direction AD, with the velocity acquired by ſalling through FA, it is required to find to what distance it will reach on the line AB. Describe, as beſore, on AE, æ 4 AF, the circle EDA, touching AB, and cutting AD in D. Through D draw the vertical DB, cutting AB in B. Then B is the point to which the projectile will reach. The prooſ is too evident to need discussion. . Lastly, suppose the object B to be given, and also the line oſ direction AD (Which is a very common case, seeing that our mortars are oſten so fixed in their beds that their elevation can be very little altered) it is required to determine the velocity that must be given to the projectile. Draw through the object the vertical BD, meeting the direction in D. Drav the vertical AE, and make it a third proportional to DB and DA, that is, make AE DAand take PA =EAmien FA is the ſall which DB 1 vill generate the velocity required ſor the projection. The demonstration of this is also very evident. 169. Notwithstanding the great simplicity of the construetion of these problems, we cannot obtain numerical solutions for practiee with equal simplicity, exeept when the line oſ position is horizontal, as in fig. 2. This indeed is the most general case; and there are fe situations so abrupt as to deviate very far ſrom this case, the greatest height oſ a fortress commonly bearing but a small proportion to the distance oſ the mortar. When AB is a horizontal plane, as in fig. 2. the arch EDA is a semicircle. In this cnse the maximum range Ab is equal to AC, the radius oſ the cirele, and equal to twice the height FA necessary for acquiring the velocity oſ the projection. This greatest range is obtained by elevating the mortar 45 degrees ſrom the horizon. 170. The ranges, vwith difſerent directions, are proportional to the sines oſ twice the angles oſ elevation For, draving GC, DL, d l, perpendicular to EA, and drawing the radii CD and C d, we have CG equal to the range Ab and I d, equal to the range AB. Now CG is the sine of the angle ACG, which is double of GAB, and ld is the sine of AC d, which is double of AE d, which is equal to the elevation d AB; and the same is true oſ all other elevations. We may always employ this analogy as radius to the sine of twice the angle oſ elevation, so is twice the height necessary ſor acquiring the velocity to the range oſ the projeclion on a horizontal plane. I7. The height to which the projectile rises above the horizontal plane is as the square oſ the sine oſ elevation. For OV the axis oſ the parabola is ;th of DB or LA; and FA, the height to which the projectile would rise straight upward, is ;th of EAA Now EA: LAæEA?: AD? ærad.è: sin. AED, /rad.?: sin.? elevation. Therefore FA: VO æ rad.*: sin.? elevation,also VO: vOæ 5in.? DAB: sin.9, d AB, &o. 172. The times oſ the ſlights are as the sines oſ the elevationn. For the velocities in the directions AD, A d, being the same, the times of describing AD and Ad uniformly will be as AD and Ad. Now AD and A d are as the sines of the angles AED and AE d, which are equal to the angles DAB and d AB. Now the times of describing AD and Ad uniſormly with the velocity oſ projection are the same with the times oſ describing the parabolas AVB and A o B. 173. When the objeet to be struck is on an inclined plane AB, ascending, as in fig. 3. the arch EDA is less than a semicirele; and when it is on a descending plane, as in fig. 4. EDA is greater than a semicirclee. This considerably embarrasses the process ſor obtaining the direction, when the impetus and the objeet are given, or conversely. It has been much osuvassed by the many authors who deliver theories oſ gunnery, and the parabola affords many very pretty methods of solving the problem. Dr Halleys, in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 179. is peculiarly elegant. Mr Thomas Simpson's also, in No. 486. is extremely ingenious and comprehensive, and has been reduced to a very elegant simplicity by Frisius in his Cosmographia. But neither oſ these methòds shew so distinctly the connection between the different circumstances of the motions, or keep the general principle so mueh in view, as the one here given; and all the arithmetical operations which finally result ſrom them, are precisely similar to those deduced ſrom our construction. same velocity, and on the same declivity, are as the products of the sines oſ d and of æ. 178. But these formula do not afford so ready an answer, when d is the thing wanted, as one would expect ſfrom their simplicity. When d is unknown, æ is also unknown. In this case we must remark, that S, æ x S, d is equal to 2nd—eos? +d  d—eos : 7d and that ? +d p. This changes our formula into r x sin.. 4 ſ x cos. æ - Lo.L Jæ z a =2— ſx cos. 2. dcos. p, =2 fx cos. ?  d2ſ x cos. ꝑ. Thereſore we have r xsin p+ 2 fx cos.  =2ſ x cos. æ - d. Having obtained the arch ? - d, and having ? +d =p, we easily obtain d, it being P?reæ3 The process is much expedited by the help oſ a table oſ natural sines. We must remember that when the projection is made on an ascending plane, the quantity 2 ſ x cos. ꝑ, is to be added to r x sin.? ꝓ; but that it is to be subtracted ſrom it iſ the projection is made on a declivity. 179. But a plainer method may be taken, although not 50 ohviously deduced ſrom the general principle The position oſ the object B being known, its horizontal distance AK is known. Call this  The middle direction Aũ is also known. The line ſ A is also known, heing =27 Now fſ C æ 2ſx tan. FAC, æ2f x cotan. ꝓ.

This is, in fact, the process to which we are ultimately led by every method that is taken for the solution oſ this case oſ the problem. The construction suggests another process, which may he more acceptable to some readers. The angle FAG is 3 EAB. Thereſore f G æ2 ſ x tan.  ꝑ, and 2 f x tan.  ) AK æg G, = the versed sine of 7 - d, CA, or 25 being radius. sID. y There are two questions more that must he solved hefore the artillerist can have all the inſormation he requires. In the throwing of shells, it is oſ peculiar importance that the fuse oſ the shell burn during the whole time oſ the ſlight, but no longer; and it would he best of all were it ended when the shell is about six ſeet ſrom the ground. This requires an exact knowledge oſ the time oſ the ſlight. 150. The time oſ the ſlight is the same with that oſ ſalling through DB. We must thereſore caleulate DB in ſeet. VDB,, DB PD Xsin. d Then (I46) t ES F T6 sinæ From the sum oſ the logarithms of the range (measured in ſeet) and the sine oſ the direction, take the sum of the logarithm of 16 and the sine oſ the zenith distance, and half the remainder is the time oſ the ſlight, measured in seconds. Iſ the best or middle direction had been chosen, which is generally not ſar ſrom being the case, DB is equal to BA or 7r. Therefore in this case we have t v : Lastly, with respect to the velocity and momentum with which the projectile makes its stroke, this is easily deduced from the property oſ the parabolic motionn. We Enow the velocity oſ projection, or the velocity at A, namely, that which is acquired by falling through FA. In like manner, the velocity at B is that acquired by ſall- ing through F ., (B æ heing drawn parallel to the horizon.) Thereſore, v FX: vF. = velocity at A: velocity at B. I81. Such are the practical problems with their morè useſul corollaries which have been deduced from the Galilean theory of projectiles, and it only remains io compure the results oſ this theory with observation. As this is the simplest case oſ the curvilineal motion oſ hodies in free space, and we have seen such exquisite coincidence in the celestial motions, in which the complication is incomparably greater, we are led to expect an equal coincidence in the case of terrestrial projectiless But ĩt is not easy to institute the comparisonn. The planets describing orbits which return through the same points from which they set out, their revolutions are repeated, and we can easily state the moment of their being in any given point of their orbits. But in our projections the whole ſlight is over in a very short time, and every time we see them they are new motions, independent on, and unconnected with any prior or posterior projection. There is, however, one case, in which the comparison seems even preſerable to any we can make in the case oſ the planetary motions, namely, the motion of a jet of water or other ſluid issuing through a small orificehere, as every drop ſollows the same path, we have the whole path exhibited to us at once. We see, in one moment, a particle in every point oſ the pathh. We can measure this path, and state its accurate form. The only other example that aſſords an opportunity for examination is the ſlight oſ a bomb-shell in the night time. We see this by the light oſ its ſuse; but the appearance is too transitory to give us any accurate inſormation. When the jet oſ water is very moderate, as when it issues with a velocity not exceeeding 20 or S0 ſeet per second, the curve formed by the jet is found to coincide vith a parabola. And when experiments are made with jets so ſimited, especially if the run oſ water is not too small, the correspondence with the theory is as exact as we can wish. The furthest jet is made on a horiontal plane with the elevation oſ 45and the elevations which give the smaller ranges are ohserved to have the due proportion, viz. that oſ the sines oſ twice the angles oſ elevation. But when the velocity oſ efſlux is so great that the water is seen to spread as it issues, and soon divided into spray, we then observe a great deviationn. When the jet is very oblique, rising in an angle oſ 45° ſor example, 7e con plainly see that the curve deviates greatly from a parabola with its axis perperdicular to the horizon. The remote branch oſ the curve ĩs seen to be much less sloping than the rising branch,and in the very great jets which are to be seen in some great water-works, the ſalling branch is almost perpendicular at its remote extremity; and the highest point oſ the curve is ſar from being in the middle between the spout and the place where the water ſalls This unequal division of the curve by its highest point may also be observed in the ſlight oſ a bomb-shell, and oſ an arrow. The time of rising to the top oſ the curve should be equal to the time oſ its descent on the other sidee But it is sensibly greater when the elevations are small, and sensibly less when the projection is made with a great elevation. The greatest horizontal range should be made when the elevation is 45; and this is generally understood to be the casee But in every experiment that has been made with considerable velocities, the elevation which gives the greatest range is considerably below that oſ 45 degreess. A strong bow will send the arrow much ſarther with an elevation oſ 36° or 35, than with 45; and a piece oſ ordnance does the same. 1582. The horiZontal ranges should be equal that are made with elevations equidistant from 45. The ſolloing experiments were made at La Fere by the Chevalier Borda, with a 24- pounder brass cannon, with the same charge oſ powder in each experiment. Three discharges were made with each elevation, and the medium range is here set down: Elevation. Range. 15 : . 1950 45 : ; 2108 60 : ; 1700 5 : . 950 Here it appears that the range at 75, which should have been the same with that at 15, wanted 25 oſ being one half oſ it. The range at 60 is but Jths oſ the range at 30. And the range at 45 ſalls considerably short oſ that at 30. The same gentleman made a similar experiment with a brass field six-pounder, with two pounds of powder. It ranged 1590 yards when elevated 45, and 1700 when elevated 30°. A I2-pounder ranged at 19 672 10 495 It should have ranged 362 Another piece at 8 690 at 4 600 It should have ranged 350 The range with an elevation of 45 should be twice the height through which a body must ſall in order to acquire the velocity oſ the projection. This comparison, which is oſ main importance, can be pretty well made with jets oſf water, because the velocity of eſſlux can be deduced ſrom the quantity which issues in a given time. In these experiments a deſalcation may be observed, even when the velocity is very moderate; and when it is considerable, the deſaleation is very greot indeed. I63. It is not easy to institute such a comparison in the ease oſ the prodigious velocities oſ military projeetiles, and we were long ignorant in this matter and had notions 50 erroneous, that our conclusions misled us still farther from the truth. At last, however, a method was discovered oſ measuring these great velocitiess Notwithstanding the magniſicent establishments ſor the improvement oſ the art in all the governments oſ Europe, and the numberless experiments which have been made, no improvement has been made till very latelyy. The experiments are oſ a kind that proſessional men alone, aided by the establishment, can undertakeand they have not heen sparedbut have heen so injudicious that they did more harm than good. Yet they appear unexceptionable. Thus, ſrom a medium of IS discharges with the same quantity of powder, and only three degrees oſ elevation, that the ſlight might be almost a straight line; it was found that 510 yards were described in 2 seconds, from which it was inferred that the velocity was 204 yards per second or GI2 feet. Calculations being made for longer ſlights from this standard were found so discordant, and led to such inconsistencies, that it was plain that the ſirst principle was grroneous. 1584. At last. Mr Benjamin Robhins, a private person, but eminent for mathematical and philosophical knowledge, accomplished this diſſicult task, in a manner that gives complete satisſaction The third law of motion teaches us that when a hody A makes any change in the motion oſ another body B, it sustains an equal change in the opposite direction. Iſ, by striking B, it gives it a quantity oſ motion I, then it loses the same quantity oſ its own motion. Iſ thereſore A, moving with the velocity 604 ſeet per second, strike on a body B a hundred times bigger than itselſ, it will give it about the IVOth part of this velo- city, nearly 6 feet per second, which is very moderate. Mr Robins thereſore discharged musket balls against a block of wood hanging like a pendulum, and so construetæd that he could tell, with great exactness, what velocity it had acquired from the blow. We shall see in due time how this may he inferred, with great accuracy, from the vibration which it will cause this suspended block oſ timber to make. Proceeding in this vay, Mr Robins found that a musket ball, discharged with the ordinary service allotment oſ powder, issues ſfrom the muzæle oſ the piece with a velocity between 1600 and I700 feet in a second. A hody falling 4 ſeet acquires a velocity oſ 16 ſeet per second; thereſore, to give it the velocity oſ I600 feet requires a fall of 40,000 feet, or 18,333 yards, /7, miles. Such a musket, therefore, elevated 450, should send the ball almost 16 milesbut, when the trial is made, it is rarely found much to exceed ; a mile, deviating ſrom the theory S1 parts out of 32. A 24 pound shot, when discharged with the usual service oſ powder, has nearly the same velocity. Yet such a hall will very seldom go three miles, which is but ;th oſ what the theory requires. This is an enormous deviation from the theory It is not so great in more moderate velocitie Thus Mr Robins ſound that a musket ball with the velocity 400, ranged only 450 yards when elevated 200. We shall find that this velocity with this elevation, should have given a range oſ 1050 yards. The experiment gave but àths of this. Another, having the velocity 700 elevated,80, ranged 690 instead oſ 1400, which it should have ranged. 185. Thus it appears, that the actual motionsoſ those projectiles differ so monstrously ſrom the theory, that it becomes oſ no use ſor directing the practice, except perhaps in bombardment, where the velocities are vastly more moderate, and the ohserved deviations ſfrom theory are much smaller, and so regular that an equation can be adapted to them, whereas the deviations oſ cannon shot and oſ small urms seem unsusceptible oſ any such reductionn. I may almost venture to say, that the numerous and splendid volumes which have been written on the parabolic theory oſ projectiles, are little more than ingenious amusements ſor mathematicians, but deserve little attention ſrom the gunner or bombardier. All that can be done for his instruetion, is to make a collection oſ experiments, with every variety oſ gun, elevation, quantity of powder, and manner oſ disposing it in the piece. In this collection, no conclusion should be drawn except by a medium of several discharges in similar circumstances. By ſar the greatest part oſ the experiments already published have little value, being injudiciously madeand they diſſer more ſfrom one another than from any theoryranges with small elevations are of no use ſor establishing the theory, hecause the smallest deviation from the direction in the vertical produces a great difſerence in the range, insomueh that the ranges with 40 of elevation are frequently observed to exceed those made vithi the same powder and & of elevotion. Such deviations are unavoidable when the ball has much room in the piece. 186. Such being the state oſ this article of mechanical philosophy, it is our business to inquire into the cause of the deviation ſfrom results so simple, and which seem so firmly established on the first principles oſf mechaniess The cause is by no means abstruse to any person that recollects that this globe is surrounded by a material atmosphere. A body cannot move through this atmosphere without pushing the air out of its place, that is, without giving motion to a quantity of matter. It is a ſaet, without exception, that when a hody in motion displaces another, the moving body loses as much motion as the other hody acquires. Although we are ſar from knowing with precision what motion is thus communicated to the air, we can draw several conclusions ſrom the general ſact oſ its being put in motion, which must be very nearly true A ball displaces the air nearly in the same manner with whatever velocity it moves. Thereſore, the quantity oſ acrial motion which it generates, will be nearly proportioned to the quantity oſ matter thus put in motion, and the motion thus induced on each particle, that is, the velocity with which it is pushed asidee The produet oſ the quantity of air displaced, multiplied by the velocity of the removal, will express the quantity oſ motion generated in the air, and extinguished in the bal. The quantity displaced in a second must be proportional to the space passed over by the moving hal. And the motion given to the same parcel oſ air must also be proportional to the velocity oſ the bal. The product is proportional to the square oſ the velocity oſ the hall. Thereſore, the motion lost by the hall, or its momentary diminution of velocity, must be in this proportion. Suppose another hall, oſ the same weight, but having twice the diameter, moving with the same velocity. It must displace a greater quantity oſ air, and this in proportion as its surſace is greater, that is in proportion as ihe square oſ its diameter is greater. The momentary loss of motion, thereſore; will be as the square of the velocity, and as the square of the diameter jointly. Suppose a ball oſ equal diameter with the first, but oſ a greater density. I moving with the same velocity, it generates and loses the same quantity oſ motion; thereſore its momentary diminution oſ velocity must be so much the less, as its quantity of matter is greater. Thus should a hall of I0 pounds, and one of 20, having the same diameter, move with the same velocity 3, the quantities of motion are 30 and 60. Now should the first lose in any time the velocity I, it loses the quantity of motion 10. The other loses the quantity oſ motion 10, and its remaining quantity oſ motion is 50. Thereſore its velocity is 24, and it has lost the velocity 3. Thus it is that we see a soap bubble descend very slowly, while a cork ball oſ the same size ſalls much faster, and a leaden hall still ſaster. These things will he more particularly considered aſterwards, and are only mentioned just now, to help us to form a notion of the more remarkable circumstances oſ this retardationn. We see, in general, that a denser body sustains a smaller diminution of its velocity when it sustains the same diminution of its momentum, and that, vith respeet to hodies of the same density, the smaller will be most retarded, because their momenta are in a smaller proportion to the momenta of the larger bodies than their surſaces are, to which the retardations are (cæteris paribus) proportiona. In general, the momentary dimi. ⸗ ne a , where u is the velocity, and d the diameter. 157. Philosophers have allowed themselves to he misled by the great disproportion hetween the density oſ the air and that oſ an iron or leaden ball, which is ſrom 9,000 to 11,000 times heavier, and have thereſore thought that the retardation oceasioned by so rare a ſluid must be insignificant. They have heen confirmed in this by the result oſ chamber experiments, with a jet of water or mercury, in which there is a suſficient coincidence with experiment. Yet a little reſlection might have convinced them, that what impels our ships, and overturns buildings, breaks down trees, and produces other ravages, cannot be insignificant in such rapid motions. It is really surprising that so little has been learned in a busy period, and on an interesting subject, especially when we think on the immense establishments in most nations for the cultivation of this art. Or, while mere military men prosecuted this subject in their ovn way, vith their moderate stock of mathematical knowledge, it is very surprising that men oſ science have not improved the art, especially since the elements have been so plainly , that is to nution of velocity is proportional to a and distinetly laid down a century ago by Sir Isuac Newton. Newton was the ſirst who eonsidered ſhe mechunical action oſ ſluis in motion, and he has given us the elements oſ all the science we yet possess on this suliject. His theory of what is now called the resistance oſ ſluids proceeds on the acknowledged principles of meelianies, and has notliing in it that is not strietly demonstrated] except the assumption of the particular constĩtution of a ſluid. This he annountes us a hypolliesiss He gives two ſorms of this hypothesis, one oſ which corresponds to the only distinet notions we can ſorm oſ the mechanical aſfeetions of common ain He sliortly demunstrates, that the diminution of motion produced by it is the same with what would be produced by the weight of a column of this ſluid, having the resisted surſace ſor its base, and having ſor its height tlie height necessary for acquiring the velocity oſ the motionn. Thus, a square in its moving in water 32 ſeet per second, sustains a resistance equal to the weight oſ a prism oſ vater I6 feet long this will hie about seven pounds:. Air heing 540 times lighter, the resistance is but the 840th oſ this, or I3 ounces. Iſ the surface move 50 times ſaster than tlis, or I600 ſeet in a second, the resistance will be 50 x 50 x 13 ounces, nearly 21 pounds on every square inci. The resistance to a musket bull should be 72 times its veight, by Newtons principles. The inattention oſ artillerists to all this is still the more surprising, as Newton supported his theory by the most unexeeptionable experiments, made by him with the utmost caree One chieſ reason seems to have been the nature oſ the experiments. Newtons measures oſ the actual resistanee oſ the air were inferred ſrom observing the diminution which it eaused in the vibrations oſ pendulums. These inſerences required such a load of caleulation, that scarcely any person but Newton had patience to submit to it. And, as his observed resistances were very small, they were disregarded. Artillerists were also greatly mistaken in their notions of the initial velocities oſ cannon shot. They had inſerred these measures from the time a cannon hall ſlew a certain number oſ yards; not suspecting, that in a second of time the velocity is reduced to little more than one hal. A remarkable experiment was made at Leith in I783, which is very instruetive in this respect. A ball of 103 pounds was discharged by eleven pounds of powder, at an elevation oſ 15. A 24 pound ball was discharged with eight pounds oſ powder, with the same elevation. They were discharged almost at the same instant. They alighted within one-fourth oſ a second of each other, and not above sixty yards asunder. From such an experiment, a person might be led to think, that the two balls moved vith nearly the same velocity; yet the smallest reſlection must convince us, that this cannot be nearly the case. By the best judgment that can be formed oſ the action oſ gunpowder, and by comparing these discharges with such as have been measured, it appears that the initial velocity of the great ball was nearly 800 feet per second, and that of the 24 pound hall was 1450. In two seconds the 24 pound ball was reduced to the velocity 8507. In 55 seconds both were reduced to 520; the smaller hall having gone 4300 ſeet, and the large one 3500. In 22 ceconds the great ball had just passed the other, having gone 9500 ſeet, and still retaining the velocity 270. The 24 pounder had the velocity 210. It was necessary to calculate these motions for every tenth part oſ a second. We see, ſrom this experiment, how difſficult it is to learn the velocitiess. We are thereſore under great obligations to Mr Robins for his discovery oſ an unexeeplionahle method oſ acquiring this knowledge. He begins his examination of this question by first finding the reiistance to slow motionsthis he did in a way that wns vOL. I. y equally accurate and origina. The surſace, 6 whichi hæ examined the resistance, was made to move round an axis at the distance oſ six or ęight ſeet, at a certain determined rate, and the force requisite for this purpose was measured hy weights. In this manner, he found that a ball 44 inches diameter (which is the size oſf a 12 pound shot) moving 25 ſeet per second, sustained a resistance of O, 7ẽ ounce avoirdupoise; thereſore, if moving 2O4 feet per second, it sustains a resistance oſ one ounce, ſor he found the resistances aceurately proportional to the square oſ the velocity. Now, suppose this hall to move with the velocity with which it is discharged with ſour pounds of powder, that is, 1600 feet per second. The resistance would he 64 3x 64 times as much, or about 184 pounds, or 154 times the weight oſ the ball. Now, the weight oſ the ball would diminish its velocity 32 feet in the first second, that is, while it ſies the 1600 feet. The resistance would diminish it 155 times as much, or 488 ſeet, reducing its velocity to 1172 ſeet, beſore it has gone 500 yards. 168. So inattentive have we been to the truths furnished us hy Newton. But Robins did not rest satisſied with this deduction from the resistances ohserved in slow motions. He contrived a still more beautiſul and original method of determining directly the initial velocities oſ military projectiles This completed the discovery, and gave a new ſorm to the science of artillery;I should rather say, that he made it altogether a new science. Mr Robins discharged the bullet against a block of timher hanging like a pendulum, and the stroke set it into vibration. We shall learn in due time how the velocity, communicated to the pendulum, may be inſerred with great accuracy from the extent oſ the vibration. As the hullet stuck ſast in the wood, its velocity was reduced to the velocity oſ the pendulum; and, as the quantity of motion remains unchanged, as much as the block of timber exceeds the ball in weight, so much did the velocity oſ the ball exeeed that oſ the pendulum. Thus, by making the pendulum suſficiently heavy, the velocity may be made as moderate as we please. With this apparatus, Robins discovered that a musket hall weighing ;th oſ a pound, when fired ſrom a barrel 45 inehes long with half its weight oſ powder, issues vith the velocity oſf between IG00 and 1700 feet in a seeond. This was a most precious invention; ſor it not only enabled Mr Robins to determine the present important question, but also to examine the whole practice of artillery, shewing what proportion oſ powder, and what form oſ chamber. and what disposition oſ the londing, produced the hest efſeet, and what is the eſeet oſ varying any one oſ all those circumstances. All the received nostrums in artillery adopted by men ignorant of principle, and sanctioned by long authority, were now open to u ſair, easy, and aceurate trial; and it was now put in our power to establish fixed principles and maxims oſf practice. Mr Robins also suggested another method of determining the velocities by means of the recoil oſ the piece, which he also suspended like a pendulum, and observed the extent oſ its vibrationn. He found, that the part oſ the recoil that was produced by the powder only was the same, whether the piece was discharged with or without a hal. This method is much easier than the other, espeeially with great guns. 159. These inventions of Mr Robins have been prorecuted with great zeal and success by Sir R. Thomson, aſterwards Count Rumford, with emall arms, and Proſessor Hutton at Woolwich has extended the experiments to halls oſ 8 poundss. It would be of great service to have two or three trials with great ordnance; ior as we find that a considerable modification was necessary for connecting the trials in small arms with those on shot oſ S pounds, we may certainly conclude that as great a modification will be necessary for connecting any oſ the experiments yet made with the performance of a piece oſ great ordnance. The ingenious discoverer would certainly have prosecuted his invention with superior address, being a person of uncommon sagacity and acuteness, and a most excellent mathematician. But soon aſter he was appointed chieſ engineer to the East India Company, in which station he would have had the ſinest opportunities. This excellent philosopher died oſ a fever, and the world vas deprived of all the knowledge which his experience would have enabled him to communicate. His dissertations on this subject were published by his ſriend Mr Wilson, in 2 vols. They have been commented on by Euler, Borda, and other mathematicians oſ the first eminence. The experiments recorded in them, and those by Count Rumford, and still more those by Proſessor Hutton, ſorm a most excellent collection of facts, ſrom which almost every thing that is important in the art may be deduced. The ſertile genius oſ Mr Robins did not stop at the discovery oſ the initial velocities oſ bulletss. His invention ſurnished him with a method oſ determining by direet experiments the assistance sustained by musket balls. By the medium oſ many shots fired against his pendulum at the distance of 25 feet, he obtained the medium velocity with which the ball struck the pendulum. He then removed it 50 ſeet further off, and repeated the experiment. The medium velocity was smaller. This diminution was produced by the resistance oſ this additional 50 ſeet of air. And thus its measure, or rather its eſſect, is given in the most unexceptionable manner. This is perhaps one oſ the most ingenious inventions oſ the last century, ſor scarcely any thing seems more removed ſrom all means oſ determination. It is thereſore worth while to record some oſ Mr IRobins's experiments, which uill give us standard numbers, to which we can have recourse on all occasions. 190. The pendulum apparatus was set up at 25 ſeet distance from the muzzle of the musket, which was firmly fixed to an immoveable mass. Aſter firing several shots into it, it was removed 50 ſeet further off, and the experiment was repeated. It was then placed 50 ſeet still ſfurther off, and a third trial was made. The results were as ſollow, a mean being taken of each set. 8 Shot at 25 ſeet struck with the velocity 1670 50 interval . Diff. 123 8 5 . .. 1547 50 interval : Diff. 122 8 125 ; . . 1425 Here we see that a musket ball, moving at the rate oſ 1670 feet per second lost 123 feet of veloeity per second, in passing through fiſty feet oſ air, and that, when moving at the rate oſ 1547 ſeet per second, it lost 122 ſeet of its velocity in passing through the next 50 feet. Now, as the ball began the passage through the first 50 with the velocity 1670, and ended with the velocity 1547, we may take 1608 for the medium velocity oſ this passage. It therefore passed through these 50 feet of air in,; part oſ a second, and it was during this small moment of time that the air's resistance retarded its motion. This enables us to form a very clear and distinet notion of this resistance, by comparing its retarding effect with the retardation that the weight of the hall would have produced. in the same time. Now we know that in;; part oſ a second, the weight oſ the ball would have diminished its velocity exactly one footl. The air's resistance has diminished it 123. It is thereſore so much greater than the weight oſ the hall, or it is equivalent to a contrary pressure oſf about 1I0 pounds and a quarter. The ball is retarded in the same manner that it would have ben had it been fired straight up, and had a weight oſ 10 pounds dragged aſter it hy a wire. This is surely a very remarkable phenomenon, and what no person would have thought possible, that a ſluid 50 rare, and so yielding as air, should oppose suth a resistance. Yet had the military gentlemen who had the iclence or the art committed to their hands for improvement, condescended to study the propositions published by Newton more than 50 years before, they would hiave seen that this resistance could not be less than 5 pounds. For this magnitude results from Newtons theorems by the most simple calculationss But, as has been already observed, they did not imagine that the velocity oſ a musket ball was nearly so great as Mr Robins ſound it, In another experiment Mr Robins ſound at 25 ſeet distance the velocity 1690 175 1300 difference 390 This retardation, when considered in the same manner, shews a resistance equal to Il} pounds, or 138 times the weight oſ the ball. l In another experiment, in which the veloeity was 1100 feet per second, Mr Robins found the resistance only 334 times the weight oſ the ball. Here is a new field oſ experiment 6òpened to those who wish to improve this art, or the science of the resistance oſ elastic ſluids. It is surprising that it has not heen occupied by any philosopher or artillerist, and that they have been contented with the experiments oſ the ingenious discoverer. Mr Robins has indeed made a great numberbut ſew of them have been published. His own curiosity was greatly excited by the curiosity of the discoveries that ie had already mude, and their importanee ſor establishing some general laws on this subjeet. His death has thereſore been an irreparable loss. By comparing à great variety oſ experiments made as now deseribed, Mr Robins ſfound that when he compared ihe resistance to slow motions with those having the velocity of 1600 or 1700 feet per second, on the supposition that they increased in the duplicate ratio oſ the velocity, the resistance to those rapid motions deviated ſrom this proportion in the ratio of 3 to l nearly, or were nearly thrice as great as on this supposition. When the velocity was only 1I00 ſeet per second, the deviation from the duplicate ratio oſ the velocity was in the proportion oſ II to 7, still very great, but far ſrom the ſormer. In all eases Mr Robins ſound the resistances to exeeed those oſ the Newtonian theory pretty considerably, even in the slowest motions, and that they deviated more and more from the duplicate ratio oſ the velocity as the velocities increased. It is surprising that this assertion of Mr Robins has not excited some oſ the eminent mathematitians to a repetition oſ the experiments. Some of them have published most elaborate dissertations on the theory oſ resistance in elastic ſluids. These theories seem incompatible with this ſact, unless some elements be taken in of which they make no mentionn. At any rate, a collection oſ experiments made in the manner we have deseribed, on all velocities from 100 feet per second up to 2000, would be oſ more service both to mechanical science and to the art of artillery than any thing that has yet been done, and till ve get such a collection, all our iheories must be very imperſect, and probably very erroneous. 191. Mr Robins, in the course oſ those experiments on the resistance oſ the air made a curious observation. In very moderate velocities the retardations were nearly as their squares. As the velocities were increased the resistances increased at a somewhat greater rate, but with a certain observable regularity, till the veloeity exceeded 1100 feet per second. But when the velocity is increased ſrom 1100 to I200, the increase of resistance is prodigious. Aſter this the resistance goes on increasing nearly with its ſormer regularity. This is a singular ſact, that there should be such a jump in the variation oſ the resistances Mr Robins guesses at the couse oſ this, with great probability oſ being right. As the ball rushes through the air, the air falls in behind it, being pressed in by the weight oſ the surrounding air. The ball may move so rapidly, that the air cannot ſill up the place leſt by the ball. In this case, the ball is retarded, not only by the resistance oſ the air which it displaces, but also by the statical pressure oſ the atmosphere. This last is nearly equal to the pressure oſ 12 poundsNow we can tell the velocity with which the air can fall in behind the bal. This must be the same with which it can rush into a void. This, by calculation, is about 1100 or 1200 ſeet per second. It is remarkable that this is also nearly the velocity oſf sound, and there is an observation oſ this kind which seems to have some connection with the mechanical ſact observed hy Mr Robins. IF a person stand in such direction from a cannon when it is discharged that the ball may pass him at no great distance, he will hear the noise made by the ball rushing through the air all the time of its ſlight, and as the ball approaches him, the noise should become more audiblee But he will hear the noise loudest at the very first, immediately following the report oſ the gun; and aſter about two seconds he may observe the sound change all at once, and not only become more faint, but even change its kind, aſter which the sound increases as the hall comes nearer. It seems highly prohable that this abrupt alteration in the sound takes place just at the time that the resistance undergoes such a change; and that it is owing t6 the difſerence in the nature oſ the undulations when there is a void behind the ball, and when there is not. That there is such a difference in the primitive agitation oſ the air, is confirmed by observing the way in which water ſulls in behind a stick drawn through it. When the motion of the stick is rapid, a void is leſt hehind it, to a considerable depth, and the agitation of the water is extremely diſferent ſrom what may be observed in slow motions. 192. From the preceding observations, Mr Robins inſers that great charges oſ powder are absolutely useless in the service oſ artillery, especially when the distance of the object is considerablee. I we would increase the velocity from 1600 to 2000, we must employ half as much more powder, with a hazardous strain to the gun, and the velocity will be reduced to 1300 before the ball has proceeded 500 yardss Had it been discharged with the velocity 1600, it would have retained 1202 at that distance, less than the other by 8 ſeet only. The velocity 1000 requires only one-third oſ the powder, and at the same distance the remaining velocity is very nearly 900. We may certainly say that a velocity exceeding 1100 should not he aimed at, because it is so rapidly reduced by the great resistancee But this subject will come better beſore us when we are considering the action oſ expanding ſluids, and we shall then take occasion to distinguish those cases oſ serviee which render the increase of velocity useſul, as in the battering in hreach, in order to cut through the revetement oſ a fortification at the bottom. Here a deep penetration is necessary, which depends on a great velocity, although the shot be not so heavy. Whereas, in the subsequent battering down, a great momentum with a heavy hall, though moving more slowly, is found more efſective in shaking down the undermined mass. 193. Mr Robins made another curious and original ohservation in the course of his experiments. He found that shot not only deſlected downward by the continual action oſ gravity, but went frequently to the right or to the leſt of the vertical plane passing through the axis oſ the gun. He discovered that this was owing to the Enocking oſ the ball on the side oſ the chace or harrel as it went along, so that at leaving the nmuææle oſ the gun, it had generally a very rapid rotation round an axis. This rotation was altogether uncertain, hoth as to its direction and its velocity. The efſect, however, was very maniſest; one side of the ball was moving in the direetion oſ the projection, and the other side was moving in the opposite direction. From this must result a force that continually deſlects the ball toward that side that is moving hackwardss. Mr Robins proved this by discharges from a crooked harrel, which caused the ball always to whirl in one way, and he ſound the deſlection to be alvays toward that side ſfrom which the barrel bent away, that is, toward that side on which the line of the barrel is convex. Great care should thereſore he taken to prevent this whirling motion of shott. No more windage should be allowed than what is sufficient ſor passing the drawing ladle round the shot to bring it outt. When the exact aim is matter of peculiar consequence, it would be advisable to use oval hullets, which cannot turn in the barrel oſ the piece, or to case them in canvas, or otherwise, so that they shall need to be rammed down. The surer aim that may be taken with a riſled piece, depends on the rotation of the hall being secured. It must be round the line of its motion; for the effect oſ the riſles in the barrel is to make the ball make half a turn or a whole turn round the axis of the harrel as it goes along it, and it continues this moſion very nearly in the direetion oſ its ſlight. This steadying effect oſ a rotation round the line oſ motion, is plainly seen in a common shuttlecock, which ſlies quite wild unless it twist briskly round its axis. In like manner, there is a great nicety in putting on the ſeathers oſ an arrow. They should be so placed, that in looking along any of the feathers, thie point of the arrow should app ær alout halſ an inch to the leſt hand oſ the direction of the ſeather. Sueh an arrow, let fſall with its point down, will sensit ly turn round its axis. Iſ it turn briskly, the ſeathers are too oblique, and will greatly impede its progressive motion. But it will ſly more true. Small pieces oſ ordnance have been made with riſled barrels, and the halls cast with protuberances to fit them. Their motion has been extremely steady, but their foree is 50 much diminished by this great increase oſ resistance, that the contrivance has been given up as unservieeable. 194. It has been thought indispensally necessary to make the axis oſf the trunnions oſ a cannon considerãbly below the axis oſ the chace. It is thought that iſ made otherwise, the trunnions have not suſſicient commection with the metal oſ the gun. But the efſect of this is hurtful to the certainty oſ the aim, and has other inconveniences. For the axis oſ the barrel being above the axis oſ the gun's motion, the pressure of the powder on the breech cauææs the breech to press strongly, and with a jerk on the bed or quoins which support it, by whieh the muzale is made to spring up in the instant that the ball is going along the burrel, and it is thus deranged ſrom the aim given it by the gunner. It is also this violent thump given by the breech oſ the gun to the carriage that causes the gun to spring up again. This is extremely troublesome. It is most remarkable in guns upon field carriages, owing to the greater elasticity of the long sides of the carriage. But it is very troublesome also on garrison and ships carriages, particularly in the latter, causing the gun to strain or disorder the breeching, and even sometimes to strike the deck above. 195. All this would be avoided by placing the axis oſ the trunnions on the line crossing the axis of the barrel at right angles. This was done with complete efſect in a set oſ guns made in 1759, for a fine privateer ſrigate, built by the late admiral Sir Charles Knowles. These guns, having the breech supported (for the experiment) by a thin chip band-box were repeatedly diseharged without making any impression on it. A nine-pounder of the ordinary form was tried along with them, its breech being supported by a little oaken box almost an inch thick. The first discharge crushed it to pieces. 196. The same effect is observed in small arms. The line of the barrel, produced backward, passes considerably above that part of the but end which is applied to the shoulder, and when the piece is discharged, it never ſails to rise above the direction intended for the shot. It is still worse in pistols. These are made almost in the most unserviceable ſorm, the line of the barrel passing so ſar above that part of the but end which is grasped,in the hand, that the pistol starts wide oſ the direction in which we think to discharge it, and it is only by practice that we ean learn to take a tolerably good aim with a pistol. They would be greatly improved by making their but end exactly in the form oſ a joiners smallest saw, which I think is called a tenon saw. If thus shaped, with the barrel pointing backward to the convexity which fills the grasp oſ the hand, they would be perſectly steady in the firing. OF CORPUSCULAR FORCES IN GENERAL. 197. Wæ have explained in suſficient detail, the chieſ phenomena which result ſfrom the heaviness oſ bodies in motion. The exquisite agreement between the legitimate deduction ſrom the premised principles oſ dynamics with these phenomena, has had the double effect oſ giving us the grounds oſ a complete confidence in the truth oſ those principles, and in their competency to the explanation oſf the appearances oſ nature. The eſſects oſ the heaviness or gravity oſ bodies will be found to mix with those oſ every other property, which ohservation shall shew us to be found in all matter, and therefore we must careſully separate the efſects oſ gravity ſrom the other cireumstances oſ the complicated phenomenon, bheſore we presume to make any inference in support oſ the existence and the nature oſ any other property which we may suppose the subject to possess. Proceeding according to the method proposed, we must now consider the phenomena which indicate a mechanical property of existing matter, that seems next, in respect oſ its generality or extent, to gravity. 195. Motion is continued or preserved in bodies by the perseveramce or inertia of matter. It is necessarily communicated to other bodies by this sensible impenetrability. It is modified by the action of gravity, so as to produce all the variety oſ mechanical changes that we observe. But this conservation, communication, and modification oſ motion, are susceptible oſ infinite varieties by circumstances which seem to characterise difſerent classes of bodies, and make them appear of very diſſerent natures. A piece oſ glass lies still on a tahle, or slides down an inclined plane. It sinks, if laid on the surſace of waterit rises to the surface, iſ plunged into quicksilverit makes a pit, if it fall on elay, but rebounds iĩſ iĩt ſall on glass, and is sometimes shivered into piecesthe ball which hits another, drives it beſore it, if it be elastibut only carries it along, iſ unelastic, or goes through it iſ soſt. A vessel Filled with grain will allow it to heap above the brim. Water will not heap in this manner. If the vessel have a leak, a little oſ the grain will ſull out, with the velocity with which any heavy body begins to ſall, and the greatest purt will remain behind. Iſ it be filled with vater, the water begins to ſlow out, with a much greater velocity, and it runs all out. Iſ one part oſ a piece of wood he gently struck, the whole is moved together. If one part oſ a pareel oſ sand be struek ever so gently, it is moved alone, and the rest remain stil. Iſ the air be comprised in a vessel, and an opening be made, it rushes out with violence and vill drive a ball hefore it, as we see in the air gun. But should we compress water in it with triple or quadruple force, no such violent eſſlux is ohservedl.. A hit oſ silver will lie for ever at the bottom of a glass oſ water. It will soon rise, and be uniformly disseminated through the whole of a glass oſ aquaſortis It will remain in this diffused state, if we add a little brandy—it will all fall to the bottom, iſ we add a little spirit of hartshorn. : : It appears, thereſore, that our knowledge, even oſ the sensible ehanges oſ motion, is incomplete, till we know ita modifications in consequence of the hardness, softness, ſluidity, or aerial ſorm oſ bodies; and that our knowledge oſ those internal motions which produce the sensible changes of ſorm in the phenomena of ehemistry and physiology, is really nothing till we understand the circumstances on which those changes depend. We might indeed consider hardness, soſtness, elasticity, and ſluidity as phenomena, descrihing exactly those forms oſ aggregation, and then proceed to consider the mechanieal consequences deducible from those ſorms. But it will he more suitable to the nature oſ philosophieal researoh, and more satisſactory to the curious mind, if we can discover some principle oſ connection, or some cireumstance of resemblance, among those forms, the modification oſ which produces those distinguishing appearances, and which immediately operates, even in the meehanical phenomena that we observe, and which it is our peculiar province to study. Should we be so ſortunate as at the same time to acquire such a knowledge oſ this conneeting prineiple as will tend to explain those difſerences oſ ſorm, and regulate the effects oſ the difſerent modiſications of tangible matter, it is plain that we gain a considerable extension of our knowledge, and that we have a better chance of being able to comprehend the nature of those operations oſ natural causes which are the subjects oſ chemical and physiological science. 199. I shall therefore think our attention very properly bestowed on a few pages, in which I shall endeavour to explain, or at least to deseribe, the chieſm appearances oſ that property of matter by which many partieles are united in one mass, having diſſerent degrees oſ eonnection, from the greatest hardness to the most perfeet ſluidity. Tt is usually called the Power of ConESION, the power by which the partieles of tangible matter co- heree. This name is perhaps as proper as any, and, likè the term Gravity, is merely the expression oſ what we conceive to be its eſfect. It may indeed be objected to this denomination, that it does not seem to include that mode oſ aggregation that we call aerial or gaseous, in which the particles, instead oſ cohering, or maniſesting any tendency to unite in one mass, shew, on the contrary, a tendency to separate ſarther from one another. For all such expansive ſluids seem to require external eompression to prevent this separationn. The objection is not improper, and were it possible to find a word in our language which would, in its common use, include this relation, maniſested in many cases between the particles of matter, it should be preſerred. But, unless we multiply the denominations oſ the properties oſ existing matter, almost without end, we shall not find words suſſiciently precise. It is too precipitant to aseribe the phenomenon to a difſerent power oſ nature, unless our knowledge oſ the other is so distinet and clear that we are certain that this phenomenon cannot be explained by any of them. Besides, the most coherent bodies are perhaps similar in this respect to the expansive ſluidss That external pressure ſorces them into smaller room we are certain, by experience. It is reasonable, therefore, to believe, that when the pressure oſ the atmosphere is removed, they occupy larger dimensions, although the difference is too small for our perception. And, on the other hand, there is, in all probability, a certain distance between the particles of air, at which their evasive or repulsive tendency ceases. This must be the case at the top oſ the atmosphere, ſor there gravity has no tendency to compress the superſicial particles. 200. It will, on the whole, be better to consider this property which modifies and regulates the sensible ſorms and mechanical relations oſ tangible matter more generally. And, as its distinctive eſſects are immediately re- lntive to the insensible particles, and more remotely to the masses composed oſ them, we may call it the corrUSctLAR FORCE, and the corpuscular action oſ matter. 20I. I have called it a force, meaning by this term vhatever is the immediate cause oſ a chunge of motion. That property by which the particles oſ matter cohere, has undoubtedly a title to this denomination. Our very first conceptions oſ iĩt state it in opposition to mechanical ſorce, and as bulancing, to a certain degree, that ſorce; ſor the most ohvious appearance oſ it is the resistance made to our attempts to separate the cohering particles. We know that the particles of wood cohere with foree, because it requires ſoree to separate them: and we give to cohesion diſferent degrees oſ foree, measured by the forces which are just not able to separate the parts of the coherent hody. Cohesion presents itselſ to us as a ſorce in the most ſamiliar and palpable conception oſ the term, an obstacle that resists our strain exerted to separate the parts of the hody, in the very same way, and exciting the same ſeeling, as i a man vere pulling against uss But cohesion has also every philosophical title to the appellation of Forceit is a moving ſorce;ſor when I push or pull one part oſ a firm hody, the remote parts oſ this body are put in motion, although I have not exerted any oſ my ſorce on them. How is this eſfected ? Solely by what I have called corpuscular action. We cannot conceive an atom oſ matter as moved from its place unless a moving ſorce acts on it. There must thereſore be romething in the parts to which I apply my force, which occasions a moving ſorce to be excited in, or exerted on, every particle that is moved. Did I apply the same exertion to part oſ a parcel oſ sand, I should move what I acted on, but no more;: and I should infer that the particles oſ sand do not coheree The cohesion is invariably inſerred ſrom the motion, and eohesion is conceived as a moving ſorce. In striet language the word Cohesion; like OL. I. o Gravitation, ĩs only a term for the ſact, that the parts cohere; but we have used it also to express that power, that foree, which produces the cohesion. We see plainly that the ſorce oſ cohesion is susceptible of degrees, and that these are measurable, whether it be considered as a mere strain, or as a moving ſorcee. The cohesion oſ a string may not only halance a strain equal to two pounds, while iĩt yields to a strain oſ three pounds, but we find also that it is sufficient to twitch suddenly a pound ball into a moderate motion, but will be broken if we attempt, by a more violent twitch, to force the ball into a more rapid motion, or to force a larger ball into an equal motion. In these last instances we consider cohesion as a moving ſorcee The consideration which now excites the curiosity oſ the philosopher is the manner, or the means by which a force applied to one part of an assemblage oſ particles mutually related by this corpuscular force, afſects all the rest oſ the assemhlage. An ordinary observer finds no difficulty in the matter; the parts, says he, cohere, and thereſore the distant parts are moved. But, in like manner, he would find no diſficulty in accounting ſor an egęgs being crushed by a man standing on it; the man, he says, is heavy, and therẽſore his weight must crush the egg We have seen, however, that this question has greatly agitated the philosophers, and that they are not yet agreed about the cause oſ this pressure oſ gravity. They cannot explain it any other way than by calling it a property of matter; and this is acknowledged to be no explanation at al. So has the question concerning the cohesion of matter; and many and various opinions have been entertained about the nature oſ the force oſ cohesion and all its modifications. But it is most prohable that our attempts to explain it, that is, to deduce it ſrom more simple or original principles, so as to be able to state cohesion as an eſfect, will be as ſruitless as they have been in the case oſ gravity, and that it will be more prudent in us to abstain ſrom the research, and content ourselves with collecting the Ilaws by which the operations oſ this force, whatever it is, are regulatedc By this procedure, hecoming the modesty oſ limited intellects, Newton has enriched science vith an immense body oſ curious and useſul knowledge, of which a brieſ account has heen given already. I shall not therefore employ any time in stating and refuling many difſerent hypotheses which have heen proposed for explaining cohesion. They may be seen in several perſormances oſ the 17th century, particularly in Muschenbroek's posthumous System oſ Natural Philosophy. Our search aſter the laws of cohesion will not indeed lead us into such magniſicent scenes oſ contemplation as filled the admiring mind of Newton. But we shall ſind it full of very interesting and unexpected objects, objects in which the heautiſul symmetry oſ nature, and the transcendent wisdom of its author, are written in the most legible characterss Examples oſ maniſest subserviency to the most useful purposes will be seen in many quarters oſ this varied scene. 202. The phenomena, which result from the operation of those natural powers which produce the cohesion of tangible matter, are so various and even dissimilar, that it is not easy to form a plan by which our inquiries may proceed. I think that it will greatly assist us in this respect, if we set out with an observation, or rather a conjecture of Sir Isanc Newton, which he formed very early in liſe, and seems to have heen more and more thoroughly eonfirmed in as his observations oſ nature were multiplied and extended. Sir Isaac Newton says, in the first edition oſ his Principles of Natural Philosophy, that as the distant bodies oſ the visible universe are connected hy gravitation, so the particles oſ which those bodies consist are connected hy mechanical forces, which are exerted only at those small and imperceptible distances which determine their peculiar densities; and, as the regular motions oſ the planets are distinetly explained by considering them ãs iustances oſf mutual deſlections towards one another, by the action of a force inversely proportional to the square oſ their distances, so, says he, all the changes which are observed in common toangible matter may be explained by shewing them to be examples oſ mutual inſlections or tendencies to inſlection, by the action of a ſorce varying according to some law oſ the distances, which we may perhaps be nble to determine by means of the phenomena. He says that he has actually observed that some bodies act on others without coming into mathematical contact, in a way similar to the action of magnetical and electrieal bodies, that is, they somehow cause those other hodies to approach them, or to recede ſrom them, which phenomena we commonly eall Attraction * and Repulsion. He has observed, that when the distance between them is less than a certain very minute quantity (about the 800) oſ an inch, the bodies are uniſormly attracted,at a distance a little greater they are repelled, and at a distance still greater, but within certain limits, they are again attracted. He has observed several alternations oſ this kind in the motion of light, as it passes near to any solid body, such  Should I, in imitation oſ Newton, eall this ſoree attraction, I do not mean to erpluin the phenomena by attraction as a physical cause, but merely employ a word, perhaps not very well chosen, as a gencral term for a very general phenomenon. The endeavour or eſfort to approach, and the resistance to separation, are phenomena as much alike as the acceleration of a falling, and the retardation oſ a rising budy. They are so insepurably connected that we cannot but consider them as phenomena oſ the same kind, indicating the same cause or power. These tendencies are oſ the same nature, whether the distances uſ the parts so related be great or smull. Iſ attraction he a suitable denomination ſor the mutual approach oſ distant budies, it is no less suitable to the resistance which the touching particles oſ a body manifest to separation. I do not mean to decide as to the cause oſ either, and merely consider them as similar phenomena. as a pin, or the edge oſ a ruler or the like All the attempts of philosophers to explain the motions oſ the planets, or oſ magnetical and electrieal bodies, by the mechanical impulsion of æthers, magnetical and electric ſluids, ſailed oſ this purpose when examined by the severe laws oſ mechanism, and nothing seemed to remain but to acknowledge the agency oſ centripetal ſorces, whether intrinsic in the central or in the attracted body, or in both. Sir Isanc, many years aſter this first intimation oſ his conjecture, when his experiments in every branch of natural knowledge had given him much more inſormation, shewing him this corpuscular action in a vast variety of ſorms, says, in his Opties, published in 170, that he is much disposed to think that the phenomena oſ cohesion, and all the hidden motions in chemical changes, are produced in the same way, that is, by attracting and repelling forces, which are exerted only at those small and insensible distances that intervene between the particles oſ tangible matter. 203. That this was not a transient conjecture, but that it had the ſull assent oſ his understanding, is evident ſrom the extensive application that he makes of it to the explanation oſ the most remarkable phenomena oſ chemistry, such as solution, precipitation, crystallisation, fermentation, &c. oceupy ing many quarto pages, and the ſrequent allusion to those reſlections in other parts of his writings; and, to define more precisely what he meant by all this, the last phenomenon vhich he attempts to explain by it is the reſlection and reſraction oſ lightt Now this had been explained in his Principia, on principles precisely similar to those employed in explaining the phenomena oſ the solar system, vi. by the action oſ deſlecting forces. Since Newton considers the cohesion of tangible matter as efſected in the same way, it is plain that he conceived all such masses as consisting oſ a number oſ diæ- erete particles or atoms, which are held in theſr places by the balanced action of those corpuscular forces. In this respect, thereſore, Newton may be said to have revived the ancient atomistical doctrine, but with this eapital distinction, that the atoms are not contiguous, but separated ſrom one another. I do not see how this notion oſ the intimate constitution oſ tangible matter can be entertained, without, at the same time, conceiving the ſorces which conneet them as inherent in them, or somehow belonging to them, like the æumu oſ the ancient philosophers, by which one kind of substance was distinguished from another. I do not speak of what a philosopher thinks himselſ warranted or obliged to do, aſter a scrupulous consideration of the subject, hut oſ what he actually does, in the familiar and unguarded eonceptions which he rapidly ſorms of things. I can only say, that I think that such eohering powers belong to matter, in the same manner, as I conceive weight or heaviness to belong to it. This is, unquestionably, a curious subject, and oſ great importance. Besides the chemical phenomena to which it has a most immediate relation, it ĩs very interesting to the mechanical philosopher. The strength oſ solids, the communication oſf motion by impulsion, the nature of fluid and aerial union, and the modifications oſ mechanical action by this union, are elementary articles of his science; and it would be a most pleasing acquisition to be able to deduce all these ſrom the acknowledged laws oſ mechanism, including in this term the action oſ central forces. 204. That the particles or ultimate atoms oſ bodies are actuated by forces e distanti, is rendered probable by many well known ſactss. All bodies are susceptible of compression and dilatation. This seems incompatible with the absolute contact oſ the ultimate atoms; nearer than contact is inconceivable This compression or dilatation requires ſorce to produce it, and to continue it. If this force is removed, the parts resume their ſormer distances, and the mass its former bulk. This cannot be explained hy the fibrous and contorted structure oſ bodies, allowing compression by the bending oſ the fibres, as we observe in a piece oſ sponge. For, in all such cases, ve come to an ultimate fibre: if this be hent, the atoms oſ vhieh it consists are brought nearer to one another on the eoncave side oſ the hend, and are removed ſarther from one another on the convex side, than when the fibre regains its natural shape. All bodies expand by heat, and contract by cold; and this change takes place in all their dimensions oſ length, breadth, and thickness. 205. Fluidity under a great degree of sensible compression seems mechanically impossible, iſ the particles oſ the uncompressed ſluids are supposed to have been in absolute contact. Air may easily be reduced into one halſ oſ its ordinary bulk. If this he supposed to be effected by the compression oſ its elastic particles, which may be supposed spherical, and to touch one another only in single points, we must then suppose that these spheres are compressed on each other into perfect cubes, (because a sphere is nearly one half of a cube of the same height). Now such a mass could no more have ſluidity than a box oſ blown bladders when equally compressedl. The particles must now be in contact, not in single points, but each with the whole oſ its six square sidesrVet is air perſectly ſluid in this statso is water, in any degree oſ compression. Its particles have never indeed been compressed into cubes, touching one another all over; because water has never been compressed into one half oſ its natural bul. But they must be mutually dimpled, and the touching surſaces exactly fitting each other like so many joggless. Such an assemblage could not be ſluid. But we have much more distinet prooſs of mutual ſorces connecting the particles oſ tangible matter, and acting on purticles at a distance. 206. Fluids, in ſalling, gather into spherical dropsrain drops are most accurate spheres, as may be demonstrated by the phenomena oſ the rainbow. The angle which it makes with the line ſrom the sun to the spectator, shews that the light is reſlected ſrom an exact sphere. Oil rises through water in spherical drops, and spreads on the surface in an exact cireular disk. All figures would be indifſferent ſor these colleetions of particles iſ mere contact were suſſicient; but the prominent particles are drawn aside, or drawn down, just as the top oſ a vave is dravn aside on the surſace of the ocean by the action oſ gravity We need not, however, suppose that the attraction between the particles oſ a drop extends to the distance oſ the radius oſ the dropbut some distance is necessary ſor producing this change oſ form, and ony, the most minute, will suſfice Iſ we take a glass tube oſ the shape of Plate II. fig 5. oſ ,th oſan inch in diameter, and ſill it with water, it will retain it, when held horizontal. But iſ we touch the surſace oſ standing water with the oriſice A, the whole, or very nearly the whole, will run out. Mere adhesion will not do this. If, aſter touching the water with the end A, we gently drew away the tube, mere adhesion would account ſor the water quilting the tube; but the eſſect now mentioned indicates a ſorce exerted by the particles oſ the water in the vessel, which draws off laterally the water in the tube. The mutual adhesion oſ solid and ſluid bodies exhibits many appearances in conſirmation of this assertion. 207. Iſ we take a slender glass pipe oſ a tapering ſorm, as in fig. 6., and aſter thoroughly wetting the inside, by causing the water to run through it, we shake all the water out oſ it, and then put in a drop or two, holding the vide end downvards, the drop oſ water will remain at the lower or wide end. Iſ we now hold the tube horizontal, the water will gradually move ſrom the wide to the narrow end oſ the tube. This can never arise ſrom mere adhesion. There is some ſorce, acting from a distance, however small that distance may heand the ſorce is attractive. It may be undertood in this way. Suppose that glass and water mutually attract each other, and that this action extends to the small distance a b (ſig. 6.) The glass oſ the ring, whose breadth is a b, acts on the water, urging it in the direction a b. But the ring de at the other end oſ the drop oſ water urges it in the opposite direction d ee. The force at the end a is to that at the end d as the circumſerence oſ the ring a b to the circumſerence of the ring de. Now it is demonstrated in hydraulics, that in order that two opposite ſorces may be in equilibrio when acting on the two ends oſ such a column oſ ſluid, they must be proportional to the surſaces to which they are appliedc But this is not the case here. The ſorces are as the acting circumſerences, whereas the surſaces are as the squares oſ those circumſerences. The ſorce at the end d is not enough for balancing the ſorce at a, and the latter must prevailthereſore the water will move in the direction d . We see, by the way, the ſorce is attractivehad it been repulsive, the water would have moved in the direction a d. Iſ we consider this fact carefully, we shall see, that by going towards the smaller end oſ the tube, the length or the little column oſ ſluid is increasedc The surſace of glass in contact with the water is also increasedl. For if it is in a part where the diameter is one halſ oſ its former magnitude, the length of the column must be quadrupled, and the touching surſace doubled. 208. We observe water and other liquids rise up all round the circumſerence oſ the vessel, ſorming a concave curvee. If a glass plate AB (fig. 7.) he wetted and dipped into still water, we observe it to heap up on botb sides oſ the plate, forming a curve a b c, oſ a very sensible height. We are not to imagine that the attraction of glass ſor water extends to so great adistance as a c, or even as the perpendicular height a e of the curve We shall soon he convinced that the extent oſ this action is too small to be measured by us. It is probable that only a very small portion, perhaps the portion d a, is the sole agent. As the water climbs up the side of the plate, it comes within the sphere oſ action of a portion still higher, and is dravn up by it, and the water thus raised drags more aſter it, by the mutual adhesion of the particles oſ water, till the weight of the whole is just a balance for the attraction of the acting portion d a of glass still above it. We shall see, however, by and hy, that a d is not the acting portion oſ the glass. Iſ the plate extends horizontally to any distanee, the water rises along the whole intersection oſ the plate with the surſace oſ the still waterr. Thus it rises all round in a tea-cup. The quantity raised will thereſore be proportional to the horizontal extent oſ the interseetion. Should we bring another plate CD, so near the plate AB, that the curve ſg h, caused by AB, interſeres with the curve i k I, caused by the plate CD, the water will rise still higher between the platess. It will rise till the whole weight oſ water raised just balances the doubled action of the glass. Unless we know the law by which the attraction is diminished by an inerease of distance, we cannot say what proportion of height will result ſrom different distances between the plates. As ſar as experiment can be made vith precision, it would seem that the height oſ water between the plates is inversely proportional to their distancee. This shews that the greatest distance at which the mutual attraction is exerted is very small, and incomparable with any measurable distance between the plates. For, were it otherwise, the water would rise higher, because there would then be some of the water acted on by both plates, and ĩls weight doubly diminished. Were the heights oſ the water accurately proportional to the distance between the plates inversely, we must inſer that there is no sensible portion oſf the whole water immediately acted on by both platess. Or, in other words, the distance between the plates is incomparably greater than the distance at which water and glass attract each other. 209. Dr Brook Taylor describes, in No. 336. oſ the Philosophical Transactions, a very beautiful experiment, which gives us a more accurate mean oſ judging in this matter, and is indeed the source oſ all our precise ideas of this subjeet. A pair oſ mirror plates ABCD, (fig. S.) are set in water. They join in the vertical line AB, and are separated a very small matter at the other end CD, thus ſorming two vertical planes inclined to one another in a very small angle The water rises between them, and its upper surſace ſorms a very exact hyperbola k a m, of which AB and BC are the two assymptotes. Let e d and g h be equal small portions oſ BC, and then a b c d and e gh f vill be two columns of water supported by the attraction. Let the angle ſormed by the plates be represented by the plan KBC. The sections . c dà and ,  h æ oſ the supported columns, are evidently proportional to their distances from B. By the nature oſ a hyperbola the heights a c and e g& are in the inverse proportion of B and B . Thereſore the quantities oſf water in the two columns are equal, and their weights are equal. This is a valuable experiment, because it states with so much accuracy the relation between the heights oſ the columns and the distances of the plates. We also learn ſfrom it, that the whole touching surfaces a c d b and e gh f are not acting in the elevation of the water. For the weight raised is the true mensure of the force in action, because it precisely balances itt. Now thie weight is the same in these two columns, while the surfaces in contact with the water are unequal in any degre We must grant that, over the whole touching surſace, there is the simple adhesion, and ſhis may be proportional to the surſacee But we see that this is not the proportion oſ the action; ſor the actions are equal, since the halancing ſorces, the weights oſ the columns, are equal. 210. There seems to be but one way of accounting for this. Iſ we suppose that only a very minute portion oſ the surſaces a c d b and e g h ſ act on the water, either a small parallelogram adjoining to c d and g h, or adjoining to a b and e f, then those being equal, their actions will be equal, and vill halance equal weights oſ water, as is actually the case We certainly cannot take this acting portion in any intermediate part oſ the cohesion, because there is no part distinguishable from another by any circumstance oſ its situation, except the extremities oſ the column. Dr Jurin, for reasons that will soon he mentioned, supposos that the acting portions are adjoining to a b and e f, (see his Dissertations in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 355, &c.) And he has been ſollowed by the greatest part oſ those who have considered this subjec. But we shall find it much more probable that it is at the very bottom oſ the column that the acting portions oſ the plates are situated. Indeed the greater probability oſ this may be inferred ſrom the great obliquity oſ the hyperbola in the vicinity oſ the assymptote AB. The line a b is not nearly equal to e f, a circumstance which seems necessary, iſ the acting portion were immediately adjoining to the surface of the water. But we shall presently see much more cogent reasons. If we make the breadth g h oſ the section oſ a coIumn equal to g, the distance between the plates at that place, the section h x may be considered as a square. Suppose this to be the section oſ a square pipe of glass. H it be true that it is only a minute portion oſ the touching glass which supports the water, and iſ this be incomparably less than the distance hetween the plates, then, whether this be at the top or hottom of the supported column, we should expeet the water to stand twiee as high in the square pipe as between the plates where the section is the same. For, in case oſ the plates, the acting surſaces are only the two sides , æ and gh; but in the pipe, we have the whole periphery  ꝗ h æ in action. This being double, should support a double weight oſ water, and thereſore a double heightt. This experiment cannot easily be made, as such a pipe can scarcely he had. But a cylindrical pipe will do quite as wel. For iſ the diameter of the round pipe be equal to the side of the square one, the proportion oſ the two peripheries is pretisely the same with that oſ the two sections. I have made this experiment with the greatest care, and I find that this expectation is completely answered. The water is supported twice as high. This is a momentous experiment. It has been long observed, that water is raised in slender pipes to heights which are inversely as the diameters, so far agreeing with the plates. This experiment completes the agreement. 21l. Here then, in slender pipes, we have another means oſ measuring the natural ſorce employed in supporting the liquid. The heights of the liquid are inversely as the diameter of the pipes. The seetions oſ the pipes are directly as the squares of the diameters. Thereſore the quantity oſ water, or the weights supported, are directly as the diameters. The surfaces in contact with the water, and thereſore the simple adhesion, are equal in them all. Here, thereſore, we have another incontestihle proof that the whole surfaces are not acting in supporting the water. In the plates, the weights supported were equal in all the columns, and the surſaces were unequal in any degree. In the pipes, the adhering surſaces are equal in them all; but the weights supported are unequal in any degree. All will he reconciled, iſ we suppose that it is only a small portion of the touching surſuces that is efſectual in supporting the watea narrow parallelogram adjoining to a b or c d, perhaps not the I00th of an inch in breadth. This being equal to h, equal weights are supported. This in the pipes, being a narrow ring at the top or bottom, is proportional to the diameter; and weights oſ water in this very proportion are supported. i I hoped to find some comparability between the distance at which this attraction is exerted and the distance between the plates, by the ſorm oſ the curve k a m. I ſfound it to be a very accurate hyperbola as ſar as the distance between the plates exceeded ,3,th oſ an inch. This was inferred ſrom the distance from AB where the curve began to deviate ſrom the hyperbola, and the distance oſ the plates at the other end DC. I ascribed the deviation from the hyperbola in smaller distances to the action of the attractive ſorce oſ the two plates interſering and being exerted on the same particles of waterr. But I was mistaken. The deviations in these small intervals were quite anomalous, and vere greatly changed hy the most triſling changes oſ distance at DC, and were uniſormly greater in some places than in others. I ſound at last, that the cause of deviation ſfrom the hyperbolic ourve was the want of perſect ſlatness oſ the platesthe inequalities oſ their surſaces bore a sensible proportion to the 1900th part oſ an inch. Employing two plates made by Dollond, and finished in the most perſect manner, I found the hyperbola strietly preserved, as ſar as I could perceive the coloured liquor that was between the platess In these very small intervals, iĩt is perceived with difſiculty. It deserves remark, that in making this experiment, the plates seem to attract one another with considerable ſorc. When the thin wedge which separates the edges DC is drawn out, we find that it is strongly pressed by them, and they close with each other as it is drawn out, and it is diſficult to get another wedge introduced. This is undoubtedly owing to the mutual attraction oſ the glass and the ſluid. 212. This phenomenon oſ the rise of water, or other liquids, in slender pipes, has long engaged the attention of philosophers under the denomination oſ caPILLARY ATTRACTION; being so named, because it is sensible only in pipes whose bore is extremely small, little exceeding the diameter oſ a hair. It has hbeen much studied, hoth because it is curious, and because it has a very extensive und multifarious influence on many important operations oſ nature in our sublunary world. To this it is owing, that the rains which ſall in the high grounds do not immediately run down to the sea with continually increasing velocity, but are retained by the soil, and, slowly fſiltering down through it, are delivered in the springs and fountains at the foot oſ the hills, so as to aſſord a constant and nearly uniform supply oſ moisture By capillary attraction does the oil or melted tallow rise slowly through the wick of a lamp, where it is converted into steam hy the heat of the surrounding ſlame, and, blowing out in all directions ſfrom the vick, is set on fire when it reaches the surrounding air. There only is it inſlamed, although we generally suppose the whole space luminouss But it is only a luminous film By capillary attraction the juices of the soil are taken up by plants and carried to the remotest leaſ, where they are partly evaporated, as the oil is dissipated ſrom the wick oſ the lamp. By capillary attraction is the lymph and other ſluids tuken up and transported to all parts oſ the animal body. No doubt the organical structure, both oſ plants and animals, is also concerned in the motion of the sap and the animal juices; but we are certain, by numerous observations, that mueh oſ this is efſeeted by mere capillary oltraetion It is solely by this that a piece oſ dry wood ahsorbs a great deal oſ moisture, and swells, with almost irresistible force. i 213. Such inſluence in the operations oſ nature justiſy the attempts oſ the philosophers to acquire a more precise and confident knowledge oſ this operation. I have already observed, that Dr Jurin was the first who gave any inſormation on which an opinion can be ſormed. The ingenious Dr Hooke, indeed, had, beſore this time, speculated on the subject, and attempted to explain the phenomena hy a principle which he ealled congruity. But men were not very ſamiliar then with the aceurate logie that is required in all philosophical disquisition, and Dr Hooke had little success in his endenvours. Dr Jurin reasõned more consequentially, ſfrom the beautiful experiment of Dr Brook Taylor, and its correspondence with the rise oſf water in capillary tubes. (S8ee Phil. Trans. vol. xxx.) Suppose two tubes AB; AB (ſig. 9. No. I. & 2) whicli support the water at heights inversely as their diameters. Dr Jurin maintains, that the water is supported entirely by the action of the ring B c immediately above the surſace oſ the water, B e being supposed the greatest distance at which the mutual attraction is exerted. For, says he, this is the only part of the tube from which the water must recede upon its subsiding, and thereſore the only one which, hy the ſorce of its cohesion or attraction, opposes the descent of the water. To make this more maniſest, hie bids us suppose the tube to be divided into squares B d, dæ, e f, &e. equal to Be. The glass in Be attracts the water in B d upwards. It is attracted downwards by the water in de. This being inferior to the action oſ the glass above it; the water is supported. In every other part oſ the tube, such as æ ſ, the water is equally attracted both upwards and downwards, and is not sensibly aſſected by those actions. The whole weight is thereſore carried by the ring B e, aided by the mutual adhesion of the particles oſf the water. It will therefore be supported at any height, provided that this mutual adhesion be equal to the veight oſ the column. In support of this reasoning, he observes, that the height at which the water will be supported depends entirely on the diameter oſ the upper orifice, whatever may be the width of the tube below. Thus. in fig. 9. No. S. the water is supported at the same height as in No. l. although the lower part oſ the tube is smalle. In No. 4. the water is supported at the same height as in No. 2. although it would have heen raised only to b by the lower part of the tube. It is remarkable, that in a tube ſormed like No. 4. the water stands at the same height, although the lower part oſ the tube be oſ any width, even several inches, provided that the upper orifice at B is oſ the proper diameter: and this obtains, even though the apparatus is placed under the receiver of an air pump. The water, thereſore, is not supported, as was asserted by some, by the pressure oſ the air. Others maintained that the water was supported in the wide part of the tube, by its adhesion to the arch immediately below the slender tubee. But a curious experiment of Dr Jurins seems to overturn this account. If the wide part of the apparatus No. 5. be filled with water up to D, very near the arch, and kept there by shutting the tube at the bottom. Then Iet a single drop of water enter at the top, and set the apparatus into the water in the cisteru, and open the tube below. The drop let into the upper orifice will occupy the whole of the slender tube, and the water will remain at the height to which it was ſilled, though it do not come in contact with the arch. The whole seems still to be supported by the action oſ the upper oriſice. Such is the reasoning by which Dr Jurin's theory is supported. It is undoubtedly very specious, and it obvOL. I. r tained the ready aequieseence of all the naturalists Mr Hawkshee has varied the experiments in many ways, and a multitude oſ others have heen added by Bulſinger in two long dissertations, in the Petersburgh Commentaries. Mr Achard also, oſ the Berlin Academy, has added many more, and philosophers were satisſied. 214. Yet the theory is certainly erroneous in its first prineiples Granting that the particles oſ water in the uppermost ring d B are attracted upward by the glass in the ring B above them, it must be as much attracted downward by the glass in the ring de. The attraction of this ring cannot he supposed to cease vhen the water has passed it. Iſ the whole tubes ſrom end to end be divided into portions equal to B, the water is in equilibrio (in respect of this attraction by the glass) in every part oſ the tube, except the lowest portion m n. For every other portion lias an equal ring oſ glass above and below it. Thereſore, if there be any truth in this mutual action of glass and water, this theory oſ eapillary attraction is in consistence with it. Let us consider the consequences oſ this action a little more particularly. 2l5. Let CF (ſig. 10.) be a glass tube, lying horizontally, and containing water, or any liquid that it attracts, between A and B, and let us suppose that the mutual attractions oſ glass and water extend to the distance AC or BD. The water in this tube will continue at rest, heing as much attracted in the direetion BA by the glass in AC, as it is attracted in the direction AB by the glass in BD. Suppose now that the tube is cut through at A as in No. 2,, by this the equilibrium oſ the water is destroyed, there being no force now to halance the attraction of BD. The water will thereſfore be carried in that direction, and vill be again in equilibrio, when it gets into the situation ED. Tt will then be equally acted on by AE and DF. In this manner the water may be made to re- move, in the direction AB, as ſar as we please by continually cutting oſſ the attracting ring at one end. This attraction has a limited ſorce, and may be balanced by any opposite force It may be halanced hy the force oſ gravity, by holding the pipe upright, as in No. S. or better, as in No. 5. by making the tube bend upward. The tube being cut oſſ at A, and the water having retreated into ſhe space ED, we may suppose water added by the other end. This wĩll make no change in EA till the level part oſ the tube be filled, then the addition will begin to push the vater from E toward A, and will reach A when the weight of the column GH is equal to the attraction. In this eondition oſ the apparatus, the whole is supported (agreeably to Dr Jurin's opinion) by the attraction of HI, unbalanced by any attraction at A If the weight oſ the water in AB, No. 3. iĩs just equal to the attraction oſf AC or BD, then, when the tube is held upright the water vwill descend, till iĩt argives at the mouth of the pipe, occupying the space Cd. The weight oſ the water is then in equilibrio with the attraction oſ the glass in B d. But it is not the attraction oſ B d that supports it; ſor Bd acts only on the water in de; for the water in d e is as much attracted downward by the glass in Bd. And if we examine every portion of the tube, we find the water in the same state oſ equilibrium, excepting the lowest portion AC. This is attracted upward by the glass in AE, without any opposite attraction to balance it. It is balanced, only by the weight oſ the water het ween c and d. This weight is supported by the attraction of the glass in EA ſor the water in ACC.We may suppose this little portion of water in AC to hecome ice, without adhering to the tuhe, and without any change in the attracting ſorces. Tt will then perform the oſſice of a moveable plug, loaded with the water in A d, and supported by the attraction of the glass in AE. When things have been thus adjusted, bring the lower oriſice of the pipe into contact with the surſace GH oſ standing water, as in No. 2. The water below it, which was ſormerly in hydrostatic equilibrio, and at rest, is now attracted upwards by the glass in CA, as much as the water in CA is attracted by the glass in AE. Thus there are now two portions oſ water, viZ?. ACCA, and CIKC, which are attracted upwards by the glass in CA and AE. Let g represent the attraction oſ glass for water. There is now a force 2 , acting upwards, in the place of the ſorce T which operated beſoree. This should support twice as much weight, and the water should now stand twice as high as beſore. But there is now brought into action another ſorce, which did not exist beſoree The water in the portion AC oſ the tube is attracted downwards hy the water CIKC in the cisternn. Let w express the ſorce with which the water in AC is attracted by the water CIKC in the cistern. The whole force which now acts on the water in the tube is the force 2 g, acting upwards, and the force u acting downwardss. Thereſore the height to which the water will be raised will be such that its weight is ='”ępu. 2il6. Hence it plainly ſollows, that if the mutual attraction oſ water for water be any thing less than twice the attraction of water for glass, it will stand higher within the tube than without it. Iſ & be merely equal to 24, the water will be on the same level both within and without the tube We learn here, that we must not infer, from the rise oſ ſluids in slender pipes, that their particles attract each other more feebly than they attract the particles oſ the pipe, which is the general opinionn. We are entitled only to inſer, that the attraction oſ the particles oſ the ſluid is not twice as great as their attraction for those oſ the pipe. Such are the genuine consequences oſf a mutual attraetion between the particles oſ a liquid and those oſ a solid. This attraction is unquestionable, and thereſore this theory oſ the rise oſ water in capillary tubes must be admitted, in preſerence to Dr Jurins, which is incompatible with the very principle by which the author thought it established. 217. This explanation oſ capillary attraction was first proposed by the celebrated Mr Clairaut, in his dissertation on the Figure oſ the Earth, published in the year 1743. But it lay there unnoticed by naturalists not much conversant in mathematical disquisitions. Indeed, it comes in so incidentally, and is so slightly mentioned, that it does not seem to have arrested the notice even of mathematicians. Lalande first took particular notice of it, and published it in a small duodecimo pamphlet in 1770. It does not seem, even yet, Lo be very generally Enown. 218. Both Mr Clairaut and Mr Lalande consider capillary attraction as a case oſ universal gravitation; but this is certainly a mistakee Were it gravitation, a ſluid would stand above the level of the cistern only when it is less dense than the pipee Now, we know that water will stand higher in a small quill than the water in the cistern. Were it gravitation, a glass pipe would support difſerent ſluids at heights inversely proportional to their density. This is ſar ſrom being the case A very slender pipe supported the difſerent fluids as follows: * Inch. Oil oſ turpentine........ 1,35 Spirits of wine............ 956 Water.... ......... 55 Caustic vol. alkali . ........ 5,25 Solution oſ sal ammoniaQ0un... 8,07 This attraction must thereſore be considered as a speci-  See Nor: I. at the end oſ the volume. sic mechanical aſfinity analogous to chemical aſfinities or elective attractions;It is difſerent in diſſerent substances for the same kind of glass, and in different kinds oſ glass for the same ſluid. 219. Iſ a glass pipe be plunged into mercury, the ſluid is lower within the pipe than without it. This shews that the attraction oſ the particles oſ mercury for each other is more than twice as great as their attraction for the glasss When two glass plates are set in mercury, it ſorms a curve convex upwards, lower than the surſace oſ the mercury in the cistern. 220. It will naturally be asked here, how it happens, as in Dr Jurin's experiments, that the height at which the water is supported depends s0 expressly on the size oſ the upper oriſice, and not at all on that of the lower oriſice ? It has been already explained how this attraction causes a drop oſ water to move ſrom the wide to the narrow end of a tapering tube. Nov, it is a matter of observation, that iſ we take a glass syphon ABC (fig. 11.) having the legs oſ diſſerent calibres, but both capillary, and put water into it, the water will stand so in the two legs, that the elevation oſ the surſace C in the smaller leg above the surſace A in the larger, is precisely equal to the diſſerence between the heights at which each of the legs would have supported the water above the level oſ the cisternn. Suppose that the smaller leg would have raised water to a height m, and the larger to the height n, then the elevation Ca will be m n. This experiment, which has heen oſten repeated, may be received as a suſſicient proof, that a contraction oſ the diameter in any part oſ the capillary canal is alvays accompanied by an excess oſ attraction directed to the narrow part of the canal. Here we have a measure of that excess, and it corresponds precisely with the measure that was deduced ſrom the principles oſ hydrauliess To apply this to the present question, suppose two capillary tubes a and b (ſig. 12.) and that a supports water to the height AM, which ve shall eall m, while the wider tube b supports it only to the height AN, which we shall call  Let the tube C have its lower part AB oſ the same hore with the tuhe -, and ils upper part BM oſ the same bore with the tube a. Let the ſourth tube d have its lower calibre equal to that of a, and its upper have the calibre b. At the lower oriſice oſ the tube c there is a ſorce n acting upwardss. At B there is a forcemn also acting upwards. Add these two together, and their sum is the ecompound ſorce, and measures the height to which the water will be raisedd Now the sum oſ n and mn is m, and therefore the water will be raised to the same height by c and hy a.* ; At the lower oriſice oſ the tube d there is a ſorce m acting upwards. At the point B there is a ſorce m~a acting downwards. The difference oſ those two ſorces is the measure oſ the compound force, and oſ the height to which the water will be raiseddc Now the diſference oſ m ond mmn is n, and the water will be raised to the same height in the tubes d and b. 221. Thus it is maniſest that the phenomena which gave such authority to the theory of Dr Jurin are perſectly consistent with Mr Clairaut's theory. Dr Jurin was also mistaken, I think, in saying that the water was not sustained in the wide vessel terminating above in a capillary tube by the adhesion to the arch oſ the wide part. It is very true that his experiments succeeds, as he says, where a small part just adjoining to the arch is leſt empty. But this happens only under the pressure oſ the * Here it must be noted that in order to raiæ the water by this tube to the height of AM, it is necessary that AB do not exceed AN oſ the tube h. Wherever the contraction B is, the water will he supporirã at the height AM, provided that the tube be previously ſilled with water. It will sink till the height of the remaining column be AM. But the empty tube vill ruiee it no higher than AN oſ the tube ſ. air. I the apparatus be in an exhausted receiver, the water will descend in the wide part, which it will not do iſ the apparatus be full oſ liquor, so as to be in contact with the whole oſ the arch. It will not, indeed, even then, remain long suspended. For, in vacuo, a quantity oſ air, which had heen chemically united with the water is detached ſrom it, and gets to the top. As so0n as a bubble gets to the lower oriſice oſ the capillary tube, the water in the wide part of the apparatus descendss The adhesion oſ the top of a lateral column of water to the arch is abundantly able to carry its weight, for it is almost immensely greater than the attraction of the infinitesimal ring oſ the capillary tube in the middle, whichi, according to Dr Jurin, supports the whole. If air were not disengaged in the manner now mentioned, I have no doubt but that the water would be supported in vacuo to the height oſ many feet. We see mercury supported to the height oſ 70 inches. 222. This subject seemed to merit a particular discussion on account oſ ils maniſold inſluence on natural operations, as well as because it is a very good example of the corpuscular forces, susceptible oſ measure, and of mathematical consideration. It rectifies our judgments concerning the intensity or magnitude of the attractive force oſ the purticles of water and other liquidss We are disposed to consider this as extremely small, because we find it so easy to separate one parcel of water from another. But this separation does not give us the smallest information on this point, and the mutual cohesion of two particles oſ water may be as great as that oſ two purticles of steel, ſor any thing that we know to the contrary. The phenomena oſ capillary attraction shew it to be 2 considerable. A pipe oſ one-tenth oſ an inch in diameter supports a column oſ nearly half an inch in heightt. This weighs one grain*?. This is supported hy the action oſ a ring oſ glass, whose breadth cannot exceed the 2000th part oſ an inch, (nay it is probable that it is almost incomparably less) and which is one-eighth oſ an inch in circumſerence nearly. The surſace oſ it is thereſore nearly ;,54555th oſ an inch, and the adhesion of water to a square inch would be 1,333,333 grains, or 190 pounds avoirdupois. But this is far ſrom being the just measure oſ the mutual attraction oſ the parts of water. It is only the difference beteen this attraction and twice the attraction of water ſor glass. It may be but a very minute portion of the mutual attraction oſ the parts oſf water, and I am much disposed to think that this is the casee When the almost absolute incompressibility oſ water is compared with the other phenomena oſ cohering matter, and the whole considered in the manner that will be unſolded by degrees, I apprehend that we are well warranted, nay obliged, to draw this conclusion. 223. The parts oſ water are easily separated, because they are easily made to slide over each other, as will be particularly explained, when we come to consider the mechanism of liquid aggregationn. This mutual attraction extends to a very minute distance, and, when the particles are so far separated, they attract no more. Suppose gravity to extend only a foot from the surface oſ the earth, and suppose that it is covered with balls oſ a ſoot diameter, which attract each other with any enormous ſorce. IF we take one of these balls in our hand and raise it, another will stick to it and ſollow it, a third will adhere to that, and a ſourth to the third, and thus we shall lift all the balls ſrom the earth, and will feel only * Acylinder oſ water one-tenth oſ an ineh in diameter, and twelve inches high, weighs 23.862 grains, or very nearly 24 gruins; thereſore very nearly l grain when halſ an inch in height. A cylinder one inch dinmeter, thereſore, weighs 2086, very nearly 2400, or 5 ounces troy. Thiæ is a convenient number to keep in mind, æ b oz. + 200 gr. avoirdupois. the weight of one, because as soon as a hall is a fooſ ſrom the ground, it is no longer heavy. It is in this way that ve may separate the particles of water ſrom the mass. 221. The measures which we have acquired oſ capillary attraction lead to several useſul inſerences. It was already observed, that it is owing to this that water is retained by the soil: not only so, but it will be raised by it. If we ſill a hollow tube with dry sand, and set it in water, we shall ohserve that the water will soak the sand to a considerable height,so much greater as the sand is ſiner; in ſine impalpable clay, the water will rise to almost any height. It is in this way that oil rises in the wick of a lamp. The wick is a bundle of fibres, with interstices between them. The fluid rises in those interstices, and will rise almost twelve times higher in the interstices of cylindrical fibres than through pipes of the same diameter, as vill easily appear by ealculating the area oſ the interstice, and its acting periphery. I already took notice oſ the swelling oſ wood by moisturee. The ſorce exerted in this way is sometimes very great. ſn raising grindstones from the quarry, it is a usual praetice to hew a long cylinder, oſ the diameter required, and then grooves are cut round it, at the distance required ſor the thickness of a grindstonee. The grooves are ſilled with wedges oſ dry wood. Water is thrown on them, and in an hour or two the whole eolumn is found neatly separated into grindstones. It ĩs in the same way that sponge swells with water. 225. These are not cases oſ mere ahsorption. The water is drawn into the cavities by an active ſorce, acting at some small distance, otherwise the efſect oſ mere adhesion would be completed when the cavities are merely fſilled. But more is still attracted, and this causes the ſlexible eavities to enlarge. It would require a pretty long discus. sion to explain how this eſfect is produced. But a very simple instance oſ the ſact will conduce to a better comprehension oſ the mechanism in more complicated cases. Scatter a few drops of mercury on a plate oſ mirror glass lying on a table, and let the drops he as nearly as possible oſ a size Lay on the plate so sprinkled another very light plate of mirror glass. Iſ the drops oſ mercury are numerous, and pretty uniſormly distributed, the upper plate will not greatly ſlatten them. Now lay weights on the upper plate. The drops of mercury will be more and more ſlattened as the weights are increasedc Now let the weights be gradually and equably liſted ofſ. The ſlattened drops, which are now spread out o a considerable breadth, will gradually contract, and will regain the breadths which they acquired by the ſirst laying on oſ the plate. The inſerence ſrom these phenomena is incontrovertiblee. The particles in each drop oſ mercury are not in corpuscular equilibrium except when in a spherical ſorm, and an external force is necessary for giving them any other shape. Their own gravity ſlattens the drops a little, even without the upper plate. The weight oſ the plate ſlattens them still more. But, as it lessened, the drops become more and more spherica. This cannot be, unless the upper plate remove ſarther from the lower one this it naturally. does. In like manner, in the foiling oſ looking- glasses, it is necessary to lay on a very great weight to squeeze out all the mercury that is not absolutely necessary for saturating the tin ſoil, and iſ these are taken off, a great quantity oſ mercury is again sucked in. I found that a plate oſ 18 inches by I4 sucked in 5 ounces, which must have raised the plate about ,th of an inch. Thereſore, in these ſacts it appears, that the drops tend to a spherical form uith fſorce, for they liſt up the plate, even when loaded with weights. 22. It is evident, ſrom the difſerent heights to which the same glass will raise difſerent liquors, and diſferent Einds oſ glass raise the same liquor, that it is a specifie attraction, depending on the constitution oſ the particles, both of the solid and the fluid. Sir Isaac Newton observed a phenomenon oſ the same kind with respect to the action oſ bodies on the rays oſ lightt. He ohserved, that when a beam oſ the suns light passed by the edge of a Eniſe, or any other solid body, the rays oſ one colour were more deſlected than those of another which passed by at the very same distance. Also, a blue ray was as much deſlected when it passed at the distance oſ,3,th oſ an inch as a red ray which passed at the distance oſ;,th oſ an inch. In short, he observed, in those delicate experimenis, that the forces exerted between the light and the solid body varied by a variation oſ distance, just as gravity does, (though not in the same proportion), and vas difſerent in relation to the differently coloured rays, thereſore specificc. Having also demonstrated that reſlection and reſraction àre performed by means oſ the same forces which produce the inſlections and deſleclions now mentioned, Newton justly inſerred, ſrom the difſerent reſracting qualities oſ difſerent bodies, that those ſorces are also speciſic in respect of diſſerent substances, and that, in particular, the particles oſ inſlammable bodies exert stronger ſorces than otherss. From this, his sagacious mind conjectured that diamond is an inſlammable body, a conjecture which has heen completely verified within these ſew years. Mr Tennants experiments prove it to he the poorest specimen of carhon. 227. When we reſlect on this specific nature oſ the ſorces which produce the phenomena oſ eapillary attraction, and the share which these phenomena have in many natural operations, several considerations are suggested which seem deserving oſ notice:. I am persuaded that much of the operation of the absorbent system in animals and vegetables depends upon mere capillary attraction, or, at least, upon mere mechanical corpuscular ſorce. I imagine that it is chieſly in this way that the nutritious and otherwise useſul parts oſ our ſood are taken up by the lacteals from the intestinal canal, and conveyed to other parts oſ the body. If so, much oſ the operation depends on the orifice by which a lacteal communicates with the intestinee. The operation will he afſected by a change oſ mere apertureit will be afſected by every change in the constitution oſ that orifice, as also oſ the ſluid taken up. By the difference oſ its substance, a vessel of the same diameter with another, and opening into the same canal, may abstract very diſſerent juices, and in this way various seeretions may arisea change of composition, whether in the ſluid or the vessel, may accelerate or obstruet the operation ?. Capillary attraction, thereſore, seems to deserve the attention oſf medical men. The poor inhabitants oſ the island oſ Ormus, who cannot afford to bring fresh water ſrom the Continent, are said to quench their thirst by lying down in cisterns oſ sea water. I saw an experiment oſ the same kind, made in 1761, at the Royal Academy at Portsmouth. A man who had abstained ſrom drinking till his mouth was parched, went into a tub oſ sea water, and in a quarter of an hour his thirst was almost gone, and he could spit ſreely. His skin had absorbed a very considerable quantity of ſresh water. 228. We know that in like manner, a plant that languishes for want of water will be completely reſreshed by immersion, although none gets at the roots. At the same lime it is probable that, both in the animal and vegetable * Some experiments, by a very intelligent and ingenious gentleman, on the rise oſ the oil and tallow in the wick oſ a lamp, shew remarkable difſerences in this respect. The publication oſ these experiments might producæ great improvement in the manuſacture oſ candles, and the preparation oſ inflammable matter. I hope that the ingenious author will not withhold ihem from public service. economy, organical structure and mechaniam are eoncerned in these operations. Although the greatest part oſ the juices rise through the plant by mere capillary attraction, it is very likely that there are also contrivances in the roots which may be said to foree or pump it up, and valves to prevent its improper return. Having employed so much time in deseribing the phenomena of corpuscular action between the particles of solids and ſluids, I shall he more brieſ in my account of such as appear in the action oſ solids on solids A small number will suſfice. 229. When naturalists intimated their acquiescence in the conjecture of Newton, that eohesion was effected by means oſ mutual forces acting beyond the purticles, it was said that were this the case, nothing more is wanted for reuniting two pieces oſ broken glass but putting them together again. But this is altogether contrary, say they, to experiencee. But we should not expect this, as the law oſ corpuscular action is unknown (at least as yet) we cannot tell but that at a distance somewhat greater than the distance oſ cohesion, the particles may repel each other. This is not absurd, but it is not even improhablee We see that magnets having their similar poles ſronting each other, repel at all considerable distances, but when brought very near, they generally, though not always, attract each other. What should hinder purticles ſrom having a similar relationn. It may require a great ſorce to bring the parts oſ a broken body near enough ſor giving occasion for the exertion of attracting forces. Besides, when we press together the surſaces of the fracture, it is perhaps only in a few points that they are near enough for attractionn. Accordingly, it is known that if two pieces oſ metal are scraped very clean, a severe blow will make them cohere so as to be inseparable. It is thus that flowers oſ gold and silver are fixed on steel and other metals. The steel is ſirst scraped clean, and a thin bit oſ gold or silver ĩs laid on it, and then the die is applied by a strong blow with a hammer. It is remarkable that they will not adhere with such fſirmness, if they adhere at all, when the surfaces have been polished in the usual way, with fine powders, &e. This is always done with the help oſ greasy mntters. Some oſ this probably remains, and prevents that speciſic action that is necessary. I am disposed to think that the seraping the surſãces also operates in another way, viæ. by fſilling the surface with scratches, that is, ridges and furrows. These allow the air to escape as the pieces come together by the hlow. Iſ the mere blow were sufſicient, a coin would adhere fast to the die. But, in coining, thie ſlat face of the diè first closes with the piece oſ metal, and eſſectually confines the air which fills the hollow that is to form the relief of the eoin. This air must be compressed to a prodigious degree, and, in this state, it is still between the die and the eoinn. We may say that the impression on the coin is really formed by this included air; for the metal, in this part of the coin, is never in contact with the die. T know of two cases whieh greatly confirm this conjecturee. The dies chanced to cruck in the highest part oſ the relief, and after this, were thrown aside, (although in one, ſor a common coin, the crack was quite insigniſicant), hecause the coin could seldom be parted from them. 290. Air seems to adhere to most hodiess. When cold distilled water is poured into a glass which has heen previously cleared ſrom all dempness, numerous air- bubbles are observed to ſorm all over the glass; and, by tapping it with any thing hard, they are disenguged, and others are ſormed in their placess. The air seems to be disengaged by the superior affinity of the waterr. Now, this air may be an obstacle to the approximation of the hodies that is required ſor bringing the attractive ſorce oſ cohesion into action. In duetile bodies, whose constitution ap- proaches to soſtness, the due approximation may be easily efſected. Thus, two pieces oſ lead (and, I am well informed, of pure gold) may he ſorced into perſect cohesion by a strong pressure, combined with a sliding motion, when they are made very clean. Two pieces of the gum eaoutchoue, ſresh cut with a clean kniſe, when pressed moderately together, adhere as strongly as any other part. I apprehend, however, that it is a very diſficult thing to bring the surfaces of two bodies as near as the natural distances hetwoen their particles. The grounds of my opinion will soon appear. 231. There is a precious experiment hby Mr Huyghens in No. 56. oſ the Philosophical Transactions. A piece of mirror glass being laid on the table, and another, to which a handle was cementod on one surface, being gently pressed on it, with a little oſ a sliding motion, the two adhered, and the one lifted the other. Lest this should have been prodũced by the pressure of the atmosphere, Mr Huyghens repeated the experiment in an exhausted receiver, with the same success. Here, then, is a most palpable demonstration that the adhesion is the effect oſ corpuscular attracting ſorces. It may be ascribed to the attraction oſ gravitation, with as much propriety as the attractions in Mr Cavendishs experiment mentioned in § 475. But another valuable part of Mr Huyghens's experiment overturns this supposition. He found that one plate carried the other, although they were not in mathematieal contact, but had a very sensible distance between them. He found this by wrapping round one of the plates a single fibre oſ silk drawn off ſrom the cocoon. The adhesion was vastly weaker than beſore, but still sufficient ſor carrying the lower plate. Here then is a most evident and incontrovertible example oſ a mutual attraction acting at a distancee Mr Huyghens ſound that if, in wrapping the fibre round the glass, he made it cross a ſibre already wrapped round it, there was no sensible attraction In this case, the glasses vere aeparated by a distance equal to twice the dinmeter of a fibre oſ silk. 232. I said that this experiment shewed that it was not the attraetion oſ gravilation that produced the adhesion. I have repeated the experiment with the most scrupulous tare, measuring the distance oſ the glasses (the diameter oſ a silk fibre) and the weight supported. I find this, in all cases, to be nearly l44 times the action oſ gravity. The caleulation is obvious and easy. I tried il in distances considerably diſſerent, according to the diameter oſ the fibre. I must inſorm the person who would derive his inſormation ſrom his own experiments, that there are many circumstances to be attended to which are not ohvious, and which materially afſect the result. The silk fibres are not round, but very ſlat, one diameter being almost double of the other. The 2400th part of an inch may be considered as the average smaller diameter oſ æ fibre A magniſying glass must be used, and great patience in wrapping the fibre round the glass so that it may not be twisted. A ſlaxen fibre is much preſerable, vhen gotten single, and fine enough, for it is a perſect cylinder. I must also inſorm him, that no regularity will be had in experiments with bits oſ ordinary mirror; these are neither ſlat enough, nor well enough polished. We must employ the square pieces which are made and finished by a very few London ortists ſor the specula of the best Hudley's quadrants. These must be most careſully clearei oſ all dust or damp. Yet this must not be done by vwiping them with a clean cloth; this inſallibly deranges every thing, by rendering the plate electrica. I succeædd best by keeping them in a glass jar, in which a piece oſ moist eloth was lying, but not touching the glasses. When wanted, the glasses are taken out with a puir of vor. n. . tongs, and held a little while heſore the fire, which dissipates the damp which had adhered to them, and which prevented all electricity With these precautions, and a careſul measurement oſ the diameter of the silk fibre, the experiments will rarely difſer among themselves one part in ten. There is another circumstance to be particularly attended to. Although one plate will liſt the other by means oſ a very gentle pressure, it will not long support it without the utmost attentionn. The lower piece always slides to one side, and drops off. Hence some have aseribed the transitory adhesion to the pressure oſ the air, which is at an end as s00m as enough oſ air has insinuated by the sides. But a little refſlection will convince any one versant in hydrostatios and pneumaties, that this supposition is altogether erroneous; without a mutual attraction, the glasses would not adhere ſor a moment, having air already between them. The glass drops ofſ by the sliding to one side, because it is next to impossible to hold the glasses perfectly level. Iſ in the least inclined to the horizon, the lower glass, having no obstruction from any thing like friction, glides nlong the inclined plane with perfect freedlom. If the plates have been hard pressed, with a sliding or grinding motion, the adhesion is then either very strong, or nothing at all; when they do adhere, it seems to be another stage or alternation oſ the force, as will be explained by and hy. But they rarely adhere, owing to ſragments torn off by the grinding. The glasses will be seratched by it. I thought this capital experiment worthy oſ a very minute description, it heing that which gives us the means of mathematical and dynamical treatment in the greatest perfection. 233. We are not to imagine that the corpuscular foree which we have just now considered is the attraction oſ cohesion. This would be to suppose that ,455th oſ an inch is nearly the natural distance of the particles oſ coherent bodies. But it certainly exceeds that distance many thousand times. In the manuſacture of gold lace, a silver wire is covered with a certain quantity of gold leaſ, and then drawn to an extreme finenesss We are certain that the covering of gold is not more than one fourteen millionth part of an inch thick. Yet this film is so continuous and compact, that the microscope can discover no pores in it, and it completely defends the inclosed silver ſrom the netion of aquaſortis. It is now time to take notice of a corpuscular action extremely diſſerent ſrom those hitherto mentioned. Every one has observed certain insects run about on the surſace oſ the water without sinking or wetting their feet. Iſ one of them be careſully viewed with a magniſying glass, u pit will be observed on the surſace oſ the water all round each ſoot, resembling what is made in a mattress or ſeather bed when a person stands on it. If the ſeet oſ those insects be examined with a microseope, they will be seen to consist oſ five or six spreading hairs, ranged as the rays oſ a star are usually dravnn. When on the water, eachi fibre is surrounded by a pit much broader than the fibre. By these extensive pits, a quantity of water is displaced, equal in weight to the insect, and the insect is supported. Yet the feet are not wetted. There is something which keeps the water from coming into contact, which keeps it at a distance, and thus forms the pit: perfeetly similar to this is the common experinent oſ making a elean and polished needle swim on water. It form just such a pit, and is buoyed up in the same vay. The ſeet of the insect, and the needle, repel the water, exerting corpuscular forees ditectly opposite to attraction. We may call them repulsions, without protending to explain their means oſ acting, merely to distinguish the eſſeect. Oſ such forces there is a vãst variety. It is owing to such repulsions that it is s0 difficult. ta wet many pon- ders, such as that of the puſfball, the lyeopodium. It is this which makes the down and the fur oſ aquatic ins and beasts almost impenetrable to water. 234. It is owing to this that we see a dew-drop lie so beautifully brilliant on the leaves of plants in the morning. We have the fullest assurance ſrom the laws of opties that the part of its surſface where the reſlection is so brilliant is not in contact with the lea. The dew- drop may sometimes be made to roll along the leaſ, retaining all its brilliancy. In this case it makes no watery trace on it. One may see the effect oſ contact very plainly by taking a little drop or hall oſ erystal, and, attending to the vivarity of the reſlection from its posterior surſace, touch the surſace of water with that part which reſlects with sueh vivacity; the vivid reſlection is destroyed in that instant, and scarcely any reſlection remains. I have oſten observæd the large drops oſ a warm summer's shower roll about for a second or two on the surface of still water, and some oſ the small drops which they have dashed up have ſallen down and rolled about for a long while, allowing me to drive them about hy ſanning them. They are remarkably brilliant while thus rolling about, thus shewing incontestibly that they are not in contact with the water. We shall soon have abundant evidence that the distance at which one hody in this manner supports another, giving rise Lo physical contact, and giving us the sensation oſ touch or feeling, is considerably less than the distance between the glasses in the Huyghenian experiment. It is reasonable thereſore to conclude, that in some intermediate distance between the diameter oſ a silk fibre and the distance of a dew-drop ſrom the leaf, the hodies neither attract nor repel. They will repel iſf pushed nearer, and attract if separated a little Such alternation is observed in some magnetical experiments, and we can generally put the magnet; at that intermediate distance in which they neither attract nor repel. But vhen, as in the case oſ the drops that we have been speaking oſ, one body is carrying the weight oſ another, they are somewhat nearer than the distance oſ inactivity. They are so much nearer, that a mutual repulsion is exerted, equal to the weight of the drop; and when, in Huyghens's experiment, one glass plate suspends another, they are at a distance somewhat greater than the distunee oſ inaction: they are so much more distant that both exert an attraction equal to the weight oſ the suspended glass. These cases resemble what happens when à body is supported by a spring. When laid on the spring, it compresses it till an elusticity is exerted equal to the weight oſ the hody. When suspended from the spring, it stretehes it till a suſficient elasticity is exerted. But while the spring is oſ its natural shape, no elasticity, either attractive or repulsive, is exerted. 235. I have already mentioned the observations oſ Newton, in which it appeared that when the rays oſ light pass by the edge oſ a solid body at a certain distance, they are inſlected towards it; if at another distance, they ure deſlected from it; and if at a third distance, they arè inſlected towards it; and if at a fourth, they are deſlected, &e. &e. But these observations may be thought peculiar to the action oſ bodies on light, and even o depend on a certain theory concerning the nature oſ light. But there is another observation oſ Newtons more direetly and unequivocally to our purpose, shewing that solid bodies act on one another at a measurable distance. 236. If we take the object glass of a long telescope, having its radius of convexity not less than 15 or 20 ſeet, and lay it on a piece oſ very ſlat and well finished mirror, or a piece oſ finely polished metal, or black marhle, we shull not observe any thing remarkuble in the reſlection of the light, unless the object lens is heavy, or is pressed down by the hand. But if we press it down, we shall ob- serve in the place of contact of the convex lens and ſlat surſace, something like a greasy spot, having the uncertain pearly colour oſ a fish scalee Pressing harder, we observe a coloured ring ſorm round the point oſ contact, reſlecting white light in the middle oſ its breadth, with blue on its inner edge, and red on its outer edge. Pressing still harder, the ring enlarges in diameter, and a new spot forms in the centre, which, by greater pressure, becomes a ring, and is succeeded by another central spot. And this succession may he continued till a great numher of rings are thus producedc A more careſful examination shews us that it is not a succession oſ spots which occupies the centre, but oſ simple colours, which ſollow one another in a determined order, so as to ſorm rings such as have been described blue on the inner edge, and ruddy on the outer. When the pressure is made very strong, a bright silvery spot appears in the centre, ruddy all round; and the next increase oſ pressure produces a hlack spot in the middle oſ the silvery spot, as iſ a ragged hole were made in a round bit oſ silver leaſ. Iſ ve now gradually diminish the pressure, we shall see the rings contract, and vanish in the centre in succession. 2387. On this observation Newton erected a most ingenious ſabric oſ optical doctrines, which will be considered in their proper placee He immediately began to consider every thing mathematicall. He measured the diameters oſ the rings, and, knowing the convexity oſ the lens, he calculated the distances between them in the brightest part oſ each rings, and he found that the distance at each ring exceeded the distance at the ring immediately within it by 55355th of an inch nearly. He also ſound that these successive difſerences were all equal. or the diameters oſ the rings were as the square roots oſ the numbers I, 3, 5, 7, &c. and the diameters oſ the dark spaces between them as the square roots oſ the numbers 2, 4, 6, S, &e. Newton's mind being completely occupied by the important optical inference which he drew from this phenomena, he paid no attention to the circumstance in which we are now chieſly interested, namely, the pressure that must be employed to produce these rings. He counted in favourable circumstances upwards oſ 20 rings, which he had ſollowed with his eye from their first lormation in the centre till their greatest expansion. Suppose that he observed 20 in this mannerr. He concluded, that when the black spot appeared in the centre the glasses were then in contact, and not beſore. On this supposition, the distance between the glasses at the 20th ring is 7;5th oſ an inch. Very rarely, however, would he perceive a ring at s0 great a thickness of the glass without some optical assistance which he describes. 238. Now it is a matter oſ ſact that, unless the lens be heavy, or pressed down, no coloured spot appears in the centre. The glasses thereſore are not in contact, but are distant from one another at least;; 5th of an inch. At this distance the lower glass supports the weight oſ the upper glass. If pressure he added to this weight, the glasses are brought nearer, and this approximation is indicated by the colour which appears in the centree Every time that we produce the red in the centre, by increasing the pressure, we must conclude that the glasses are ,53;5th of an inch nearer than they were at its preceding appearance; and thus a relation may be discovered between the distances and the intensities of the resisting forces, in the same manner as Newton inſerred the law of gravity ſrom the deſlections produced by it. Nothing can be better established than the conclusion ſrom this experiment, viz. that those hodies act on each other at a distance, in the same sense of the words as when we say that the sun and planets act on one another. We may say that they repel one another, in the same way as we say that tvo magnets, or two electriſied bodies, repel òne ànother We do not mean by this abbreviaſion of language to assign the mode of action, but merely the appearance of the effect. 289. I have repeated this experiment of Newton with great care, and I find it most accurately described by their illistrious author. I hoped to ascertain the law of action by means oſ the pressures employed But I found myselſ unable to express the relation hetween the distance and force oſ the acting purticles by an equation. We may easily see that this must be diſficult; ſor it is not the central particles alone that are acting, but also those all around, to an unknown distance, were acting with different forces. The experiment requires very well finished glasses; ordinary low priced lenses are good for nothing in this research; their errors of figure bearing a considerable proportion to ,y4,5th of an inch. But they shew the rings very well, if the convexity be sufficiently smal. Even the lens of a pair of spectacles will do this, iſ it is oſ 20 or 30 inches ſocal distunce, but the rings will be exceedingly small, and scorcely distinguishable. Newton supposed that the glasses were in absolute mathematical contact where the black spot appeared, for which reason he thought it was that they allowed the light to pass through as if they had been one continuous mass of glass. But it may be asked what authority Newton had for this supposition. We are indebted to him for a complete answer to this question, but an answer very different ſrom his declared opinion. This we obtain by means oſ another precious experiment of Newtonss The beautiſul colours oſ a soap bubble, which had oſten amused him in his boyish years, now recurred to his memory with strong persuasions of their importance in his present speculations, and he immediately examined them with the attention oſ a philosopher. 240. Having blown a soap hubble of a small size, he corered it with a bell glass, to ward ofſ the disturbanee by the æir, and careſully noted the appearances of colour in the bubblee He saw, aſter some litſle time, like æ pearlcoloured spot in the very uppermost point or enith of the soap bubble This in a little spread itselſ into a round spot, ruddy in the centre, and blue round the circumſerence. This widened into a ring, ruddy within and purple without. Another spot formei in the centre; this also became a ring, the other ring enlarging in the mean time. The second spot became a ring, and was succeeded by a third, which underwent the same change. In short, coloured rings formed and enlarged on the upper hemisphere of the soap hulible, in the same succession, and' having the same colours as those seen hetween the objeet glasses; but incomparably larger, more distant, and more brilliant. He could sometimes count 50 of them. Aſter some time, there formed in the enith a bright silver- coloured spot, in which there soon appeared a ragged hole, which sometimes enlarged itself to the breadth oſ one third oſ an ineh or more, and then the bubble burst. This central dark spot seemed at first altogether without reſleetion; but more careful inspeetion shewed that it still reſlected a minute quantity of light. Newton had already inferred from the experiment vithi the glasses, that the difſerent colours reſlected at different distances from the common centre oſ the rings depended on the difſerent distances of the glasses. Here, in the experiment oſ the soap bubble, we have the same succession of colours. Newton explains them by oliserving that the bubble grows gradually thinner at top, by the subsidence of the clammy liquid, and that the different colours depend on the thickness oſ the film where they appear. He proved this immediately aſter this discovery, by splitting tale till it produced permanent colours: Even gluss moy be blown so thin as to exhibit them. But those optical inſerences are not our proper object at present. It is enough that we have seen that the film may be so very thin as to give no vivid reſlection; yet it has some thiekness, ſor the bubble exhibits the spot for some little time before it bursts. 241. Here then we have abundant evidence that the appearance oſ the black spot between the glasses did not prove that they were in mathematical contaet in that place, but only that the distance hbetween them was too small for producing any sensible reſlection oſ lightt. There is no doubt oſ the spot between the glasses, and the spot in the soap bubble being corresponding phenomena. They are remarkably distinguished from all the coloured spots that successively formed them. The silver. like rings which surrounded this black spot are quite unlike all the coloured rings, being incomparably more vivid. But the chieſ distinction is the abrupt, irregular, and ragged inner edge oſ the silvery ring which surrounds the spot. It is exactly like a hole carelessly torn in the middle of a hit of silver leaſ, whereas the edges of all the coloured rings, and even the outer edge oſ this silver ring, are undeſined, like the edges of the rainbow. The conclusion seems thereſore unquestionable, that we have no prooſ ſrom the black spot hbetween the glasses that they are in mathematical contact in that place. We know, by the first experiment, that a very considerable ſorce is necessary for producing the black spot. A greater pressure makes it broader, and in all probahility this is partly by the mutual yielding of the glasses. I ſound that beſore a spot, whose surſace is a square inch, can be produced, a force exceeding 1000 pounds must be employedlc. When the experiment is made with thin glasses, they are oſten broken beſore any black spot is produced. 242. What is it that we properly, and without any figure of speech, call a pressure? It is something that we are informed oſ solely by our sense oſ toueh. What do feel by means oſ this sense, when the upper lens lies in our hand ? It is not the matter oſ this lens, ſor we now see that there is some measurable distance between the lens and the hand; it is this repulsion. Give a blind man a strong magnet in his hand, and let another person approach the north pole of a similar magnet to its north polee. The blind man will think that the other has pushed away the magnet he holds in his hand with something that is soſt. In the same manner, if the blind man be electrified, another person passes the open palm oſ his hand to and ſro near the blind mans cheek; he will say that cobwebs are driven across his cheek. All this is owing to the electrified hand repelling every hair or down oſ the ſace, and causing it to bend this vay and that way, as iſ it were really touched by a cobweb. There is thereſore an essential diſſerence between mothematical and physical contuct; between the absolute annihilation oſ distance, and the actual pressure of adjoining bodies. We must grant that two pieces oſ glass are not in mathematical contact till they are exerting a mutual pressure not less than 1000 pounds per inch. For we must not conclude that they are in contact till the black spot appears; and even then we dare not positively aſfirm it. My own decided opinion is, that the glasses not only are not in mathematical contact in the hlack spot, but the distance between them is vastly greater than the 89000th part of an inch, the diſſerence oſ the distances at two suecessive rings. My reasons ſor thinking so cannot be laid beſore you till you have acquired some optical knowledge. Now we have complete explanation of the curious ſacts mentioned above; the ſree motion of the insects on the surface of water. Its brushy ſeet are in physical, but not in mathematical contact with the water, and by repeliing it, depress so much oſ it that they are supported. And here we have an instructive piece oſ inſformation. If the vater be pretty warm, or iſ we mix a small portion of spirits with it, the insect can no longer walk on it, but sinks on it up to the belly. There is, therefore, in this case, a specific law of corpuscular action, suited to the purposes oſ this inseet, but different perhaps from the more general repulsion that takes place between all bodies. Tt is also explained how the dew-drop rolls along a cabbage leaſ, of sparkling brilliancy, and does not leave a trace. 23. Mr Saussure mentions a thing oſ the sume kind, which I had oſten observed, without reſlecting on its curiosity. The particles of a ſog or mist, as they pass by, rebound from any thing that they are driven against by the wind, like a tennis bal. Another example mentioned by Saussure is very amusing. If a dish of warm coſfee without eream be set in the sunshine, and sheltered from any stream of air, the vesicles oſ vapour which rise from it oſten ſall down again, and roll about on the surſace of the coſfee, most brilliant and sparkling. Therefore they are not in contact with the liquor, because in that case you would have no brilliancy. In the suame manner may the rain-drops of a varm summer shower be oſten seer to roll about on the surſace oſ water, brilliant like à dew- drop, and for the same reason, hecause they are not in contact with the surſace Electricity supplies us with facts to the same purpose. If the discharge of the coated phial be made through a chain lying loosely on a table, or on a glass plate, it is rendered sparkling all over. If the chain be hanging in the air, forming a bight, it will not be nearly so luminous by the discharge. Iſ a great weight be hung on its middle, no light will be observedl The explanation is easyg A spark is produced at every link, when they are not in mãthematical contact. When this is almost completely produced by the weight, the light must ceasee IF a chain be port oſ a galvanic cirele, the shock is not transmitted by it, unless it be well stretched. 24. I ſatter myselſ that the experiments oſ Huyghens and Newton, and the spontaneous phenomena oſ nature which have been mentioned, shew, in a manner still more distinet than the phenomena oſ capillary attraction, that the particles oſ tangible matter act on each other with moving forces, at certain small and measurable distances, in the same manner that the sun and planets mutually act on one another. But the distances now under cousideration are greater, almost incomparably greater, than what should he considered as the natural cohering distance of the particles even oſ the rarest substance Thereſore we must not consider the phenomena which have now heen described as examples oſ the action oſ those ſorces which produce the phenomena oſ cohesion, in all its modiſications of elasticity, duetility, soſtness, viscidity, and ſluidity, whether liquid or aerial. Yet these examples are oſ the greatest use in our attempts to investigate the intimate constitution of tangible matter; because they shew us that there really exist in nature mechanical or moving ſorces, acting, like gravilation, at a distance, hut clearly distinguishable ſrom it, by their law oſ variation by a change oſ distancee While gravity produces sensible efſects at the utmost houndary of the solar system, these other ſorces seem limited in their exertion to a small ſraction of an inch, perhaps not exceeding , 5/5th part in any instance; and in this narrow hounds we observe great diversity in the intensity, although we have not yet heen able to ascertain the law of variation. What is of peculiar moment, we liave seen that those corpuscular forces even change their kind by a change oſ distance, producing, at one distance, the mutual approach, and at another distance the mutual separation of the acting corpuscles, ſrom being attractive, becoming repulsivee Now when an attractive force, by a gradual variation of distance, becomes repulsive, we cannot avoid thinking that, iſ we could hit on the exact distunce, we should ſind that the particles neither attraet nor repel. We even observe a phenomenon which greatly resembles thiss. When two magnets oſf a soſt temper are placed with their north poles fronting each other, and are at any considerable distance from each other, they invariably recede. If we push them gradually nearer, we find this tendency to recede gradually increase, as the distance diminishes, till the repulsion acquire a maximum of intensity, aſter which it rapidly diminishes, and at a certain distance of the magnets; it vanishes entirely; and when we bring them still nearer, they evidently attract each other, and this attraction increases till they come into contact. Here is a very distinct analogy with what we have discovered on a much smaller scalee Nothing hinders us ſrom supposing that the force by which cohesion is effeeted has a similar law oſ actionn. From this supposition we can deduce certain distinet consequences, which we can compare with the phenomena of cohesion. We shall find them extremely conſormable, as will be shewn by and by; and thus ve ean form to ourselves mechanical notions oſ the intimate constitution õ tangible matter, and of the procedure of nature in operating many changes which we see its masses undergo. We can do all this with a degree oſ confidence which we should never have had without those experiments. l Let us thereſore consider a little the train of conclusions which we are entitled to draw concerning the change in the corpuscular ſorces, occasioned by a change oſ distance between the particles. 245. At all considerable distances, hodies attract each other by gravitation, but at certain very small distances, they repel one another, and at other very small distances, they attract. 246. (a) The distance at which one glass plate attracts another, in the Huyghenian experiment, is greater than the distance at which they repel one another, exhibiting coIoured rings. For, while the one suspends the other, with a silk fibre interposed, no colours appear between them; take away the silk fibre, and press them strongly together, and colours are produced: these vanish when the pressure is removed, and in this state the plates again attract. 247. () The distance at which glass plates repel, exhibiting colours, in Newton's experiment, exceeds that in which glass attracts water, in the phenomenon of simple humeſaction, or capillary attraction. For, when water is admitted between the glasses, in which case it is attracted by, and adheres to them, the coloured rings appear between the glasses as hefore, only the thickness exhibiting any particular colour is diminished in the proportion oſ 4 to 3. This shews plainly that the adhesive distance is contained (perhaps many thousand times) in the colorific distancee As a farther confirmation oſ this, it may be remarked, that when a film oſ water evaporates ſrom a glass, the same colours appear in the vanishing film, just before it disappearss A drop of oil oſ turpentine, by spreading out on the surſace oſ water, exhibits those colours when it has become thin enough, and they change as its thinness advances, by its diffusion on the surface of the waterr. The thickness oſ this transparent film of oil of turpentine may be estimated by comparing the diameter of the drop with the extent oſ ils diffusion. It will be found to have a very sensible proportion to the diameter oſ a capillary tube which supports oil of turpentine at a certain height; and this shews that this diameter is incomparably greater than the sphere of eapillary attraction. 248. (c) There is the greatest reason ſor believing that this small distance is vastly greater thun the natural or cohesive distance between the particles oſ glass or oſ water. Iſ it were not, Iscarcely can conceive how it can couse the water to rise in the pipee It would require a long discussion to make this clear, but we are nol reduced to this as the sole argument. We have now acquired considerahle inſormation concerning the law of cohesive ſorce, within certain limit. We see that a change in their mutual distance is accompanied by a change oſ force. When liquids gather into drops, it is because the porticles are otherwise at such distances from one another on their different sides that they are not in equilibrio, and it is only by changing those distances that the balance can be effectedl. This motion is æ elear indication oſ a change oſ intensity by a change oſ distance. It is perhaps more distinetly perceived by compressing the ſluid. Here we see that a greater force is required for producing, and for maintaining a greater compression. Fluids which gather into drops are not susceptible oſ great compressionn. But aerial ſluids exhihit ĩt almost without limit. Thus air is seen in some experiments to occupy a thousand times as much space as in some others, and it will expand still more iſ permitted. In this expanded state its purticles are ten times more distant ſrom one another than in its denser state; therefore, in its denser state, the mutual repulsion must he conceived as reaching to the tenth particlee. This may perhaps constitute the mechanical difſerence hetween the aggregation of liquids and that of airs, gasses, or vapours. The action of liquids may perhaps extend only to the adjoining particle, while that oſf the expansive ſluids may extend over many. There are great diſficulties attending both oſ these hypotheses. 249. The change oſ cohesive intensity by a change oſf distance between the particles is as distinetly, or more distinctly seen in the cohesion of solid bodies. All that we are acquainted with are susceptible (in various degrees) oſ compression and dilatation. A greater ſorce ĩs required for producing, and ſor maintaining a greater change oſ bulk, and when the ſorce is withdrawn, the body resumes ils natural bulk, iſ the change has not heen too grentt. We must conclude ſrom Lhese ſacts, that the purticles oſ a solid body, when at their natural distances, neither attract nor repe. When ſorced nearer to one unother they repel, and when drawn asunder they attract. 250. In our experiments of this kind, a ſact is observed that is perhaps universal. Iſ the compression or dilatation has been very moderate, s that the change oſ distance between two adjoining particles is but a minute portion oſ that distance, it is ſound that it is proportional lo the attraclive or repulsive eorpuscular ſoree which is excited by the change. A double, riple, quadruple ſoree is required for making a double, triple, or quadruple change of distance between the particles Dr Robert Hooke made this discovery with respect to springs and all elastic bodies, in 1660, and expressed it by the phrase ul lensio sic vis. It was this observation that suggested to him his noble improvement on pocket watches, by pulling a spiral spring on the axis oſ the balance. The balance assumes a certain quiescent position. Iſ any ſorce can turn it 10 degrees ſrom this position, in opposition to the spring, a double ſorce will turn it 20 degrees, a triple force will turn it 30 degrees, &e. Such a balance, thereſore, vibrating by the action of this spring, will perform its vibrations in the same time; whether they extend 10, 20, or 30 degrees on each side oſ the quiescent positionn. Mr J. Bernoulli investigated the curve into which an elastic rod will be bent, on the supposition that the attractive and repulsive ſorces which are brought into action by the bending, are proportional to the change produced in the distances between the particles When this curve was compared with experiment, they coincided most perſectly. Mr Coulomb oſ the French academy suspended bodies by long wires, and then, twisting the vire a certain number oſ turns, he let it go, and observed the oscillations. He ſound them perſectly isochronous, VOL. I. In whether the wire was twisted once, or ten, or twenty times. This proves incontrovertibly that the ſorces exerted between the particles are exactly as the changes of distance Now when this is the case, ve may say with confidence that those compressions are but very minute portions of the natural distances oſ the particless The truth of this inference will appear very clearly when ve considee Mr Boscovich's attempt to investigate the laws of corpuscular action. Thus we see that the analogical reasoning concerning the ſorce of cohesion, founded on the actual observation of alternate attractive and repulsive corpuscular forces altogether difſerent ſfrom cohesion, are ſully supported by the phenomena of cohesion itselſ. 251. From a collective view oſ all those ſacts, ve must conclude that the ſorces by which the particles oſ tangible matter cohere in its various forms of aggregation, are, like gravity, forces which act at a distance, and that they vary, hoth in quantity and direction, by a variation of distance. We must also conclude that the distance at vhich one body suspends another (for it is not confiner to the Huyghenian experiment with glass) is greater than that of cohesion or capillary attraction; and, since we see that enormous pressures are necessary, in the Newtonian experiment, to bring the nearest parts of two hodies within the 895000th part oſ an inch of each other, we must conclude that at these greater distances the particles oſ bodies act on one another, and that this repulsive action is probably the immediate cause of physical contaet, exeiting the sensation oſ touch, and the ſeeling oſ pressure, and that this is the immediate cause of all the mutual pressures which we ohserve hodies exert on each other. It is thereſore the immediate cause oſ all the motions and changes oſ motion which are produced hy those pressures. All those may and must happen without any real mathematical contact oſ the bodies. 252 The deſlection oſ a planet from the tangent oſ its orbit, the deſlection oſ a cannon ball ſrom its parabolic path, the approach oſ a piece oſ iron to a magnet, the similar motion oſ electriſied bodies, the suspension oſ one plate oſ glass hy another, the repulsion between two object glasses, the motion oſ one body when it is struck by another (arising ſrom the same repulsion), the motion oſ water in a capillary tube, and the motion of the particles oſ a springy body when it is bending or unhending, are all facts oſ one kind. They are all equally the eſſeets oſ natural powers which act between distant particless. Oſ this I apprehend every intelligent person will he persuaded, if he steadily conſines his attention to the particles reully in action. 253. Iſ a vortex, or a stream of ſluid of any kind, be considered as necessary for explaining the deſlection oſ a planet, it is equally necessary ſor explaining the motion of a billiard ball when struck by another. Nay, it is as necessary for explaining the action oſ this vortex or stream oſ ſluid. For, since the appearance oſ the black spot between the glasses does not entitle us to say that they are in mathematical contact, every particle of this vortex must be granted to repel at some minute distance, or else ve must suppose another vortex belonging to each partiele oſ the ſirst to render it impulsive. In short, this view oſ the subject euts oſſ at once all explanations by the help oſ invisible impelling ſluids, æthers, atmospheres, or hy whatever name they may he calledc All changes of motion have ſor their immediate eauses those powers oſ nature which we have called aceelerating ſorces, accompany ing the particles, and bronght into action, or excited, by the mere distance and situation oſ the related particles: There is no mechanical diſſerence between them. The only diſference is the distance in which the ſorce is exerted, and the variation oſ intensity by a variation oſ distance. II we knov these two ciroumstances, we have all the knowledge that can he oſ any usee HOW gravity or any other power produces its effeet is of no other use but the gratiſication of curiosity; and if it wero gratifiedl, ve should be etually curious to find out the cause oſ every step oſ this process oſ efficiency. 254. Planetary action extends to the utmost bounds of the solar system, and is in the inverse duplicate ratio oſ the distances. Magnetism also extends to a great distance, as we learn by the motions oſ the mariner's needle. The law oſ action seems to resemble that oſ gravitation. Electricity is also extensive, and has the same lawv. Physical contact, or rpRESSURE, becomes sensible at the distance oſ the 5000th part of an inch nearly, and decreases much faster than in the inverse duplieate ratio oſ the distances. I could inſer this ſfrom my experiments with the glasses with great confidence, although I could not assign the precise lawm. Cohesion, with all its modiſications, has a much more limited range, perhaps not the millionth oſ the millionth of an inch. This may be inſerred ſrom the perſect continuity oſ the gold or the silver wire employed in the manuſacture of gold lace, where it is the fourteen millionth oſ an inch in thicknesss Yet even in this minute seale, we see hy the experiments with springy bodies, that this minute distanee may be subdivided into many portions, and that each distance has a peculiar intensity oſ cohesion belonging to it. Its law oſ variation, taking it generally, is unknown. For the observation oſ Hooke, ut tensio sic vis, is true only when the changes of distance are very small in comparison with the whole natural distance between the particles. We shall consider this more particularly aſterwards, and shall learn why Hookes observation is so generally truee The modifications oſ eohesion are innumerable, producing an endless variety oſ sensible ſorms, solid, ſluid, vaporous, in each of which the law oſ action hetween the corpuscles is pro- bably diſferent. Also, in each oſ these ſorms we have ubordinate varieties, vhich make bodies hard, soſt, elastic, unelastic, plastic, duetile, viscid; and lastly, there are other modiſieations oſ the corpuscular ſorce, which produce the phenomena oſ solution, precipitation, erystallisation, &e. &e. &c. All and each oſ these are ultimately mechanieal forces, producing local motion and changes of motion. 255. In this range oſ observation there are two extremes. On the one hand, enlarging our scale, we have eleetricity, magnetism, and gravitation. This last leads us to the bounds oſ the solar system. Nay, there are appearances which render it probable that it extends at least to some of the ſixed stars But we have not sulficient authority ſor extending it to all. Gravitation may cease at a certain distance; nay it may change to a repulsive ſorce at greater distances, and the visible universe may consist oſ parcels which are in equilibrio with one another, as the particles of a common hody are in equilibrio between a state oſ attractions and repulsions Each parcel oſ connected stars, magniſicent as it is in our eye, may thus constitute a portion or particle oſ the universe. 256. Our imaginations are lost in the contemplation oſ such a scene. But there is no ahsurdity in the thought. The ingenious Dr Halley proved ſrom the law of gravitation, that there may be within this globe a scene oſ existence and habitation altogether undisturbed by the gravitation of external bodies, yet every thing having weight and stability nearly the same as on the surface oſ the earth. To its inhahitants the scene may appear as extensive as the heavens appear Io us. 257. There is just as vonderſul a series oſ conneeting forces on the other hand, when we consider the smaller scales on which they are exerted A pint oſ corrupted puddle is perhaps as great a universe to its countless inhabitants as the visible heavens are to us. It requires some efſort oſ imagination to subdivide the 460th part of an inch into the 50 difſerent portions in which Newton ohserved the alternate inſlection and deſleetion of light; or to subdivide the 4450th oſ an inch into the 20 portions where light was alternately reſlected and transmitted. Yet far within the limit of one unit oſ this subdivision, viæ. 25à55th of an inch, are exhibited all the alternations oſ attraction and repulsion which we observe in the compression and dilatation of bodies. In these minute scales oſ Toree there must he many diſſerences, both in the magnitude of the scale, according as the body is dense or rare, and in the intensity oſ the force, according as the body is hard, soſt, viscid, &e. &e. and in the law of its variation. But the most wonderſul variety is exhibited to our observation in the strueture oſ regular bodies, such as erystals; and still more in the structure oſ the organized bodies oſ vegetables and animals. We have acquired some knowledge oſ the more obvious particulars of our own structure; we understand something oſ the efiiciency oſ this strueture, how it is capable oſ perſorming its oſfice. We understand all this by means oſ the laws of mechanies, that is, the general ſacts observed in the agency oſ all pressures. We have now learned that pressures are forces acting at a distance, which are so small in comparison with ourselves that we cannot perceive them. 258. Now, in those incomparably smaller structures which the microseope has brought into view, we hehold machines, which perſectly resemble, both in ſorm and in funetion, the large animal machines which are more ſamiliarly known to us. These little machines must be moved in the same way as the larger. The whale and the minnow, the minnow and its ſry (not one tenth oſ an inch long) have the same veins, and arteries, and nerves, the same livers and muscles, and their ſfunctions in both are the sume. The minnow is a giant when compared with the red ant; yet this little creature is construeted with a variety oſ paris, and with a polished elegance in every member, that exceeds the most delicate piece oſ human art, beyond all imagination. It is really a wonder. One of ils antinnæ, (not 5th of an inch in length) has I2 joints, each consisting oſ a finely polished spherical ball, mov ing between two hemispherical sockets, all finished with the utmost attention to elegance of shape and fitness for angular motionn. The most elaborate performance oſ human ort being laid beside it, and viewed with the same glass, appears a piece oſ the rudest botching. On this heautiſul little creature, Mr Southern discovered an acarus, a vermin to which the red ant is a world. Even this animal is ſormed with symmetry, and a great variety of parts. Beyond this our eyes, with all the assistance oſ the microscope, can discern no more strueturee. We can only gaze and wonder at many still smaller animals, which the microscope exhibits, swimming about with great vivacity, and indieating by their motions that they are efſecting the same purposes which are efſected hy the larger animals; this authorises us to infer that they are oſ similar mechanism, and that their operations are perſormed by the same principles of mechanical energy. 259. The conclusion which I think must be drawn from these observations, is that those alternations oſ attraction and repulsion  hich accompany the gradual diminution of distances, as we continue to subdivide the extent of a hairs breadth, must go beyond all our conceptions of minuteness. The distances at which or pressures are excited, and our sensations oſ touch, will no more answer the purposes which we see accomplished by those little ereatures, than an axe and a sledge- hammer will suffice ſor making a repeating wateh contained in the size of a seal ringg. We must grant that there are seales still smaller, on which those necessary ſorees complete all their variation of intensity and direction. And lastly, since all those little objects consist oſ parts extremely diſſerent, both in component ingredients and in structure, we are certain that the particles oſ each oſ those parts are still oſf a very compounded nature, ſar removed ſrom the simplicity oſ a primary atom of matter, nnd thereſore consisting oſ many atoms, connected by forces oſ a class still more removed from those we are acquainted with. 260. On the whole, ve see that within the narrow limit oſ the ſour or five thousandth part of an inch, (the greatest distance of sensible pressure,) there actually are a numberless variety and alternation oſf attractive and repulsire forces exerted between the particles and atoms oſ tangible matter, and that it is to their immediate ngency that we must aseribe all the diversities oſ connection, form, and distinguishing properties, which charaeterise the objects by which we are surrounded in this sublunary world. In giving them the denomination oſ attracting and repelling forces, and in ealling their eſfects attraction and repulsion, nothing is meant but a denomination. No explanation oſ the manner oſ acting is intended. But they are all supposed to be of the sume kind, and similar to the gravity or heaviness oſ terrestrial matter. Iſ any explication can be given oſ gravitution, the same must be applicuble to those forces which connect the particles oſ tangible matter. All that we are entitled to say oſ them is that they vary in intensity and direction by every change oſ distance, ſrom the utmost bounds of the solur system to the actual coalescence oſ the acting atoms. i What then must we conceive to be the ultimate action oſ atom ol atom, as ve diminish their distance without end, and just before the annihilation oſ all distance between them? It seems to me that it must be an inseparable repulsion. We see in the sensible masses a repul- sion which is prodigiously great, beſore they can be brought to that vicinity at which no light is reſlected by the glass plates; and we have no evidence that we can bring them into mathematical contact by any ſorce whatever. 261. It is very surprising that the mathematicĩans and philosophers at the end oſ the 17th century, wvho were 50 arduously engaged in applying the newly discovered ſluxionary mathematics to the explmation of the mechanical phenomena oſ nature, did not turn their attention to a department which promised the richest crops oſ discoveries to reward their labours Newton had also given the philosophers a new system oſ mechanics, purticularly fitted for this research, and had demonstruted ils competency by the most suecessſul examination oſ the great movements oſ the universee He had also remarked some very encouraging analogies, which seemed to admit the same manner oſ treatment in the study oſ the corpuscular phenomena, and had even pointed out to them many phenomena of this class, which stemed to require this method alone ſor their explanation, and to rejeet it from every other quarter; and he gives us some account oſ his own conjectures on the subject in the queries subjoined to his Optics. Nothing however was done that was oſ any service, it we exeept the speculations of Bernoulli, Mariotte, and others, about the strength of solid bodies. Yet even these attempts were encouraging. The immense diſſiculty oſf the task was doubtless the great obstacle, and seems to have deterred even Newton ſrom ſormally engaging in it. Dr John Keill indeed gave, in No. 315 oſ the Philosophical Transactions, a number of general theorems concerning the action oſ ſorees attracting or repelling aceording to various luws of the distance; and Dr James Keill and Dr Friend gave Theories of Physiology and Chemistry, ſounded, as they said, on similar theorems. Bul these theories were filled with gratuitous assumptions oſ forms and motions, which rendered them altogether ridiculouss. This brought the whole department oſ study into diseredit, and it remained entirely neglected for many years. 262. The first who (so far as I know) attempted to revive this study in a serious manner, was the celebrated magnetical philosopher Dr Gowin Knight. He published, in 1748, his  Attempt to explain all the phenomena  oſ nature by means of two principles, attraction and  repulsion, shewing that gravitation, cohesion, magnet-  ism, electricity, &e. are all the operation of those two s principles. Mr Knight supposes two species oſ material atoms, one oſ which attracts another atom of the same kind, and the atoms oſ the other species mutually repel each other. The atoms oſ diſferent species probably attract one another; but of this he is not certain. He then shews how the attractive atoms coalesce into particles; and how those particles must be surrounded with the repelling atoms constipated on their surſace, and even surrounding them like an atmosphere. From this combination arises another class oſ particles, which are mutually attractive or repulsive, according to the proportion and disposition of the atoms oſ the two spaces of which they consist. Mr Knight then proceeds to explain ſrom those premises the strueture and sensible properties oſ bodies of various kinds. The whole is digested into formal propositions and corollaries, very distinetly expressed, and the law of action which he assumes (viz. a force inversely as the distance) is applied matliematically. There is very considerable ingenuity and great simplicity in the management oſ his principles; but it requires only a moderate attention to the unchangeable laws oſ dynamices to shew that almost every one oſ his propositions is ſalsee At the same time it is not unsusceptible oſ improvement, and it deserves a serious perusal. This study has never heen resumed and prosecuted with method and perseverance. Yet the case does not seem desperate; although we may never be able to acquire such accurate knowledge oſ the corpuscular relations oſ tangible matter as we have oſ the simple laws oſ the planetary motions, and the ordinary doctrines oſ mechanies, hydrostatics, and pneumaties, it is highly probable that a steady and judicious prosecution oſ it would bring to light some general laws which might be Oſ material service. 263. Father Boscovich, one oſ the ſirst mathematicians oſ Europe, and of very extensive knowledge oſ the phenomena of nature, struck with the importance and probability oſ Sir Isaac Newtons conjectures, has endeavoured to revive this study, and published at Vienna in 1759 a most ingenious work, which he called Theoria Philosophiæ Noturalis ad unicam legem virium, in Natura existenlium redactu. This is oſ a very diſferent cast indeed ſrom Dr Knights, and is undoubtedly one oſ the most curious productions oſ the last century, filled with original and ingenivus notions oſ natural things, and explanations oſ all the general appearances and mechanical relations oſ diſſerent kinds oſ matter. It richly deserves the serious perusal oſ every philosopher. Although the ingenious author is ſar ſfrom having attained the knowledge oſ this characteristic lav oſ mutter, or established a perſect theory, he has deduced many legitimate consequences ſrom the phenomena, which are oſ very important service in all mechanical disquisitions; and I may even venture to say that, iſ we shall ever acquire the knowledge oſ a true theory, it will resemble Mr Boscovichs in many of its chieſ ſeatures. Tor which reason I shall give a slight sketeh oſ its leading propositions, reſerring the reader to the work itself ſor a ſull account oſ the theory *. The ſollowing are the elements oſ this theory. 264. lst, All matter consists oſ indivisible and inextended aloms. 265. àd, These atoms are endowed with attractive and repelling forces, varying, both in intensity and direcetion, by a change of distance, so that at one distance two atoms attract each other, and at another distance they repel. 266. 3d, This law oſ variation is the same in all atoms. It is thereſore mutual; for the distance of o from b heing the same with that of b ſrom a, iſ o attract or repel b, b must attract or repel a with precisely the same ſorce. P0. 4th, At all considerahle or sensible distances this mutual ſorce is an attraction, sensibly proportional to the square oſ the distance inversely. It is the attraction called gravitation. 268. 5th, In the small and insensible distances in which sensible contact is observed, and which do not exceed the 1000th or 1500th part of an inch, there are many alternations oſ attraction and repulsion, according as the distance oſ the atoms is changed. Consequently, within this narrow limit, there are many situations in which the two atoms neither attract nor repel 269. 6th, The ſorce which is exerted between the two atoms, when their distance is diminished without end, and is just vanishing, is an insuperable repulsion, so that no force whatever can press two atoms into mathematical contact. Such, according to Boscovich, is the constitution of a * See Note IL. at the end oſ the Volume- material atom, and it is the whole oſ its constitution, and the immediate efficient eause oſ all its properties. 270. Two or more atoms may be so situate, in respect of distance and position, as to constilute a PARTICLE Of the first order. Two or more such particles may constitute a partiele of the second order, and s0 on, to any degree oſ composition. Mr Boscovich proceeds to deduce such consequences oſ this eonstitution as may be called elementary; and then to shew that these are sufficient ſor constituting a substance having all the sensible qualities, ſorms, and physi-cal properties that we observe in tangible matter; and that, although all atoms oſ matter are precisely similar, there must result ſrom their combination, and the joint nction oſ their atomical ſorces, an inexhaustible variety of external form, mutual relations and actions, ſully adequate to explain all the phenomena oſ the material universe. 27l. All that can be done in the short while allowed ſor this discussion is merely to enable the uottentive student to ſorm a just notion oſ this most ingenious theory, and of its competency to the explanation of nature. I trust that he will see enough to incite him to a perusal and serious study oſ the work, and that he will find it ſull'of curious and valuable information. Mr Boscovich represents his law oſ atomieal action in the Newtonian manner, by what he culls an experimental curve. l 272. Let the distances oſ two aloms be estimated on the line CAC, Plate III. fig. I. A being the situation oſ one of them, while the other is placed any whère on this line. When placed at i, for example, we may suppose that it is attracted by the atom A, with a certain force We can represent the intensity oſ this ſorce by the length oſa line i l, perpendicular to AC, and we can express the direetion oſ it (namely the direction i A, because it is attrac- tion) by placing i l above the axis or line oſ distances AC: Should the atom be at æ, and be repelled, we can express the intensity oſ repulsion by æ t, and its direction (A2) by placing æ ſ below the axis. This may be supposed done for every point of the axis, and then a line DEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTV may be drawn through the extremities oſ all the perpendicular ordinatess. This is the exponential curve, or scale of forces, in the manner employed in DvNam©s. As there are supposed a great many alternations of anttraction and repulsion, it ſollows that the exponential curve musi consist oſ various branches, lying on diſſerent sides oſf the axis, and must thereſore eross it in many points, such as E, G, I, L, N, P, R. All those are supposed to be contained within a very small fraction oſ an inch, not exceeding the distance oſ the glasses in the Huyghenian experiment. AR may represent this distance, magnified by a microscope. 273. The branch most distant ſrom A is STV. This must he of such a form that its ordinates CV, v2, o ꝑ, &e. may be inversely as AC?, A oẽ, A oẽ, &e. RC must be an assymptote to this branch; and the branch ED next to A, must have the perpendicular AB ſor its assymptote, hecause the ordinate, expressing repulsion, increases heyond all limit. The intermediate branches oſ the curve must be determined by means of the phenomena oſ cohesion, capillary attraetion, the repulsion of the glasses in the Newtonian experiment, &e. &e. It is pluin that an atom situated in any oſ the poinis E, G, I, &e. where the curve crosses the axis, will neither be attracted nor repelled hy the atom A. But there is a remarkable diſſerence heleen the condition of an atom situate in E, and of one placed in G. If the atom E be pushed a little nearer to A, as to b, (A being held ſast in its place), it will be repelled by A, and a ſorce equal to the repulsion b r must be employed to keep it in b; and if this force be withdrawn, it will come hack again to E. On the other hand, if E be dravn off to d, (A being held ſast) it will be attracted by A, with the force d h, and iſ the extending force be withdrawn, it vill go back to E. Hence it appears that two atoms situated in A and E, will compose a sort oſ particle, which will have a certain degree oſ permanency oſ form. It may be compressed by an external force, or it may be distended, but will recover its bulk AE when the compressing or stretehing foree is removed. 274. An atom placed in G will be in a very difſerent condition. It may remain there ſor ever, iſ no compressing or distending ſoree is applied to it. But, if compressed in the smallest degree, ſor example to i, it is immediately attracted by A, and fſlies towards it with an accelerated motion, and vill finally settle in E. If G be drawn ofſ to m, it is immediately repelled with the force m n, and will ſly farther oſf, and proceed to I, or perhaps ſarther. Hence it appears that the atoms A and G cannot compose a permanent particle, but the smallest disturbance will immediately destroy it irrecoverably. 275. It is plain that the points E, I, N, R, are situations oſ the first kind, and that G, I, and P, are oſ the second kind. Boscovich ealls the first LixiTs or conESION, and the second L?s oF NON- conESION. These last are better named LiMiTs OF DISSOLUTION. I said that particles, such as AE or AI, have a certain degree of permanent ſorm, resisting compression or dilatation, and again recovering their natural bulk. But this is only when the disturbing force, and the change oſ bulk, have been moderate, the change oſ distance being very small in comparison of the whole distance between two intersections oſ the exponential curve with the axis. For iſthe particle AI be compressed into less room than AG, the atom will not return to I when the compressing force is vithdrawvn. For it will now he attracted hy A, and the particle AI will collapse into the bulk AE. If AI be stretehed beyond the bulk AL, it will not collapse into AI, but will take the ſorm AN. The only particle that cannot he changed by any compression is AE, as is evident. It is evident that the component atoms oſ particles so constituted are in a state of innctivity on each other, unless some external ſorce he appliedc. The atoms A and I neither attraet nor repel each other. But when the par. ticle is actually compressed, the atoms being pushed nearer than thoir natural inactive distance, they immediately repel; in like manner they attract if the particle be stretched. The approximation or separation oſ the atoms gives occusion or opportunity to the exertion oſ the attractive or repulsive forces which are inherent in, or at least always accompany the atoms. Thus these ſorces may be said to he excited in them, or brought into action. The compression or dilatation is thereſore the occusion, though not the efficient cause oſ the mutual attractions and repulsions. We must always keep this distinetion in mind. 276. The magnitude or intensity oſ those atomieal forces at the different distances determine the ſorm oſ the exponential curve. If a very moderate ſorce produces a sensible compression, the ordinates on eaeh side oſ the limit must be short, expressive oſ those small repulsions. The exponential curve must thereſore cross the axis very obliquely, that the ordinates expressing the attraeting and repelling ſorces may increase slowly. But iſ it require n very great ſorce to produce a very small compression, the small compression A b must have a great ordinate br, and the exponential curve crosses the axis almost perpendiculurly. We may also remark (and the remark is important) that when the dilatation or compression bears a very l small proportion to the natural distance of the atoms, the compression or dilatation will he very nenrly proportional 1o the forces employed. For, when the compression E b is very small in comparison with AE, the arch r E diſſers litile ſrom a straight line, and thereſore the ordinates r b, rV are very nearly proportional to Eb and E&. The same may he aſfirmed of the distension IE d. The arch Eh diſfers little from a right line, and the ordinates are nearly as the abseissæ?. But it is otherwisæ when the dilatation is considerahlee When the dilatation E d is much greater, the ordinates d h must now increase more slowly, and, when the dilatation has increased to a certain degree, the ordinates will even diminish again, and they are reiluced to nothing in the neighbouring limit oſ dissolution. Many examples oſ this will oceur in the phenomena oſ nature. On the other hand, when we observe the compression or dilatation proportional to the ſorce employed, we may conclude that the compression or separation oſ ihe atoms is very small in comparison with their natural inaetive distance. 277. We may now take the example oſ this simplest constitution of a particle to shew that, although the law of atomieal action be the same in all matter, the action of particles composed oſ such atoms may he unspeakably various, according to the distaneæ and position of the two component atoms. We have not room ſor much of this diseussion, and must content ourselves with one or two oſ the most simple casess But the attentive reader will find no diſficulty in extending the inferences to more complex cases. We shall first consider the action of such a particle on an atom placed in the axis or line joining the romponent atoms. Suppose thena particle XY (Plate III. ſig. 2.) composed of iwo atoms X and V, which are placed in this ſirst limit oſ eohesion A and E oſ fig. . In order to know the condition of an atom placed any where in the line AC, we may vOL. I. s suppose the whole exponential curve shiſted toward C, so as now to refer to the atom E as it formerly referred to the atom A. Thus, for any point in the line EC, where we suppose the third atom to be placed, there are two ordinates, one of them an ordinate to the curve belonging to A, and the other an ordinate to the curve belonging to E. Iſ those ordinates are on the same side oſ the axis, then the third atom is either attracted by both A and E, or is repelled by both. We must thereſore drawv an ordinate in that point, equal to the sum oſ the two ordinates This will express the force acting on the third atom But iſ the ordinates of the two curves lie on opposite sides oſ the axis, the third atom is attracted by one, and repelled by the other component atom. Thereſore we must make an ordinate equal to the difference oſ the two, and place it ahove or helow the axis. according as the repulsive or attractive forces prevail. Doing this ſor every point, we may draw a curve through the extremities oſ all the ordinates, and it will be the exponential curve for the particle AE or XY expressing its aection on a third atom placed in the line AR. Accordingly, the curve in fig. 2. is constructed in this very way. By this we see that the lav of action of the particle XY, diſſers greatly from that oſ the component atoms X and Y. The branch d A d between the two assymptotes c b and cV, is easily understopd. At A, the repulsions of the two atoms X and Y must exactly balance, and as the third atom comes nearer either to X or to Y, it is more strongly repelled by it than by Y or by X. 278. If an exponential curve had been constructed for a partiele consisting of two atoms A and I, it would have turned out still more unlike the primitive exponential. This will easily be conceived hy shiſting the primitive curve ſfrom A to I. We shall then find that several of the attractive branches of one curve stand opposed to repulsive branches oſ the other, the consequence of which must be that the particle AI will be almost inactive on a third atom, till it be moved almost to the ſurthest limit oſ the small seale oſ corpuscular action. 279. It is much more important that we learn the law oſ action on an atom placed out oſ the line ACC. But we must still begin with a simple casee Let us take a parlicle composed oſ the two atoms A and I, situated in this second limit oſ cohesion, and let us consider the action oſ the particle Al in fig. 3. on an atom placed any where in the line BCB, which bisects AI at right angles. Suppose the third atom placed in . Then join A u and Iu, and taking Au in the compasses, transſer it ſrom A in fig. Ito u, and draw the ordinate uy. This is an ordinate oſ an attractive branch of the exponential. Thereſore, in fig. 3. set off from u, towards A, and towards I, the two lines u y, uy, equnl to the ordinate u v of figz. I. The atom u is attracted by A and I with the forces uy, uyComplete the parallelogram u 5 v u, (Which is a rhombus) and its diagonal v u will express the foree with which u is attracted in the direetion u C. Draw u y perpendicular to u C, and make it equal to u v, placing it on the right hand oſf BC, if it represent an attractive force, and on the leſt as æſ, to represent a repulsive force. Eet this be done for every point of the line BCE, and drav a curve line CGHIKLMNOPQRSTV through the extremities oſ all the ordinatess This will be the exponential oſ the action of the particle AI on an atom placed any where in the line Be B. We see that this line oſ action diſſers most remarkably from that oſ a single atom. It has indeed, like the single atom, many alternations oſ attraction and repulsion. But instead oſ an insuperable repulsion at the greatest vicinity, ve see that the repulsion changes, at G, to attraction, which continues all the way to the centre, and that in the very centre C there is no ſorce, either attractive or repulsivee Such a purticle, thereſore, will be easily pe- netrable, though composed of atoms exerting an insuperable repulsion. It is scarcely necessary to advertise the reader that the exponential curve extends on both sides of the line AIL and that the attractive and repulsive branches below C are on the opposite sides of B C and B C. Thus GHI and G'H'I' are repulsive branches. Ohserve also that all the branches on the right hand of B CB express a ſorce which produces a motion of the third atom in the direction BB, and all those on the leſft hand express forces which produce a motion in the direction B'B. It is not unworthy of remark that our particle AI greatly resembles a magnet in its action. For it has heen already observed that this particular construction oſ the particle renders it almost inactive on an atom placed in the line AI, while ĩt acts very sensibly on an atom placed in the line BB. In like manner a magnet acts strongly in the direction of its poles, and is without action in the direction of its equator. Moreover, since we observe that a parcel of small magnets, or oſ magnetical ſragments of iron, ſloating on quicksilver, have a disposition to cluster together in a porticular way, rather than in any other; and since this arises ſrom that difference in action which we eall polarity, we must ascribe similar tendencies to a colleetion of particles constituted like AI. They will possess polarity, and will cluster together in one way in preference to all otherss. Keeping this in mind will greatly aid us in conceiving some oſ the hidden operations oſ nature. 280. Thus then we seæ that, even in this simplest constitution that can be imagined for a particle, the action on another atom is susceptible of great variety, by 1he mere difſerence of position and distance hetween the two eomponent atoms. But it must be ſarther remarked, that all these difſerences oſf action on a third atom are conſined to the small and insensible distances which lie vithin the limits of physical contact. At all considerable distances, we shall find nothing but the action oſ gravitation, inversely proportional to the square oſ the distances, and also proportional to the number of atoms which compose the acting particle This will easily appear, when we consider the primitive exponential curve with a little attention The whole distance AR (fig. 1.) does not exceed the thousandth part oſ an ineh. Thereſore supposing A and R to be the component atoms, (Which constitution oſ the particle will oceasion the greatest possible shiſting oſ the exponential curve), then, even at the distance oſ only a quarter oſ an inch from the particle, the sum oſ the ordinates oſ the two eurves will not difſer one part in ſive hundred ſrom the double of either; and at the distance oſ an ineh, will not difſer one part in a hundred thousand. Therefore, at all sensible distances; we may conclude that the ſorces are in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances ſrom the middle oſ the particle, anũ are double oſ the force tending to either of the component atoms. The slightest consideration will shew usi that this is equally true of a particle composed of any number oſ atoms, the particle itselſ being of insensible magnitude. Its action on a distant atom will be inversely as the square oſ the distance, and proportional to the number oſ atoms in the particle. 281. This is equally, and even more accurately, true oſ its action on an atom situated in the line BB of fig. 3. For, iſ we take even so small a distance as CR, which is within the limits oſf physical contact, the distances AR IR difſer very little ſrom CR. It is surely unnecessary to insist longer on what is so plain. From these considerations, we see that all the varieties in the law of corpuscular action will be observed only in the small and insensible distances which lie within the Iimits of physical contact, while the masses of matter consisting oſ the atoms so combined will exhibit, in all sensible distances, the attraction oſ gravitation, proportional to the number oſ atoms, that is, to the quantity of matter in the mass. 282. We have hitherto considered only such particles as consist oſ two atoms. But it is evident that, iſ the three sides oſ a triangle are respectively equal to three limits oſ cohesion, and iſ an atom be placed in each oſ the three angles, they will be in a state oſ indiſſerence or inactivity, in respect oſ one another. Iſ one oſ these atoms be moved a little away ſfrom the other two, this increase oſ distance will be the occasion oſ attractive ſorces exerted mutually between them, so that the other wo will be drawn aſter it. Or, iſ the atom be pushed towards the other two, so as to lessen its distance ſrom them, repulsive ſorces are exerted, aund the two remote atoms vill also be pushed away. This ĩs surely the character of a particle But we must examine this connection more particulorly. We have already seen that iſ an atom be placed in the point u oſ the line BB, ſig. 3, it is attracted hy the partiele AI with a force u5, and that iſ placed in⸗, it is repelled with the force æ ?. In either case, thereſore, it is impelled towards the situation N, where its distances NA or NI is the same with NA oſ the primitive exponential, fig. I. This happens, not only when the atom is drawn away ſrom its quiescent situation N in the direction NB, or pushed in the opposite direction NC, but also, when removed ſrom N in any direction. Thus, in ſig. 4. let the third atom be dawn laterally ſrom N, into the situation n. By this removal, it is drawn a little farther ſrom the component atom A. It is thereſore attracted by it, we may suppose with the ſorce n . By the same removal, it is brought a litt°le nearer to the atom I. It ĩs thereſore repelled by it, suppose with the force n . By the joint action of the Asorces n o and n ꝑ, the atom is impelled in the direction n q, and made to approach ils quiescent situation N. It requires a ſorce ꝗ n to keep it in n, (A and I heing supposed to be held ſast by some means in their places) and when this force is withdrawn, it returns to N. Thus we see that A, I, and N, will compose a particle, having both length and breadth, and that it retains both its bulk and its shape with a certain forcee It has all the characters oſ a particle It is surely needless to shew that all these things are true, although the form oſ the particle be not that oſ an isosceles triangle All the reasoning would have been the same, although one side had been AI of the primitive curve, fig. l. another AN, and the third AR. All that is required is that the three sides of the triangle be limits of cohesion. 283. It is of particular importance to altend to the lateral force n ꝗ exerted by the atom N, fig. 4. when it is dravn a little aside ſrom the line NC joining it with the centre oſ the particle A. This circumstance gives us a elear notion how a number oſ atoms may be disposed and combined s0 as to compose a material surſfacee For, if they he all placed symmetrically, in the angles of triangles, so that each atom may be in a limit oſ cohesion with its adjoining atoms, as is represented by the points in fig. 5. such an assemblage will form a sort oſ material surſace. Iſ the atoms in the line AB are held ſast in their places, and a small force be applied to the atom CD, tending to urge them towards E, it is plain that this must excite the corpuscular ſorces inherent in the atoms. Those in the side DB will be compressed, and will exert repulsive ſorces, while those in the side CA will be drawn ſarther ſrom each other, and will exert attractive forcess We shall have a very distinet and a very just notion oſ this mechanism by supposing all those atoms to be connected by slender elastic spiral ires like corkscrews. Urge any one atom nearer to another, and we compress the interposed spring. It resists, and when we withdraw the compressing ſorce, it unbends, and pushes the atom to its ſormer distance I we draw an atom ſarther ſrom its neighbour, the intervening spring, being stretched, exerts a contractile ſoree, which will, in like manner, bring the atom bãel to its nãtural quiescent position. A little attention to this, (for without attention nothing ean be Iearned) will make it evident that the ſiexion which the external ſoree produces on the hodies so conneeted, and the resistaricæ oppused by the hodies when thus hent, and the recovery oſ the original ſorm when the external force is withdrawn, ull proceed ſrom the elastieity oſ the connecting wires. This elastic action obtains whenever a spring is compressed or stretehed, ond not otherwise. In like manner, the inherent corpuseular ſorces must be exerted, or àn opportunity must he given ſor their exertion. This is done by changing the natural distances oſ the stoms, in which they exert no force, ſor greater or smaller distances, in which they, exert attractive or repulsive forcess. Aud we easily perceive that this exeitation oſ the atomicnl ſorces takes place over the whole assembluge. For, when D ſig. 5. is pulled in the direction DE, it drawn away ſrom C, and is pressed a little tovards l. Thereſore I resists, and is at the same time pressed towards 4. This side, thereſore, becomes a sort oſ ſulerum or prop, by means of the exerted repulsions. C is dravn aſter D, and thereſore is separated from 3, and attrãction is exeited between C and 3. The atom S is thus dravn avay from 5, and attruetion is exerted between them, by which 5 is drawn away ſrom A. And thus all the atoms on the side DB are in a state oſ compression, exerting repulsive ſorces, while those on the side CA are stretehed, and exerting attractive forces We need only consider what spiral wires would be in a state oſ extension, and what in n state of compression; and we may be assured that they are exerting forees precisely similar to the utomieal forces in the ſlieory of Boscovich. Beſore quitting the subject oſ the material surſace; therè remains another important observation. 2064. Let A and B (fig. 6.) be two atoms. The circles deseribed round them as centres with a ſull line, are supposed to have limits oſ cohesion ſor the radii. The dotted cireles have for their radii limits oſ dissolution. Thereſore an atom in C will remain theree S80 will an atom in N, D, E, G, F, K; or M. S8uppose N drawn towards u, it tends to come back to N. For iſ ĩt be situated in any part of the little quadrangle between N an q, it is attracted both by A and by B. In like manner, iſ it be in any part of the quadrangle between N and b, it is attracted by A, and repelled by B, and thereſfore tends towards N. In short, into whichever oſ the four quadrangles round N it he taken, the combined action oſ A and B tend to urgè it towards N. The atom will also remain at rèst in o, b, c, d, e, f, or g Suppose a to be dravn into any of the quadrangles whieh surround it, for example, into the quadrangle a C, it is repelled both by A and B. Thereſore it will not return to a, but will immediately go to C. Iſit be taken into the quadrangle a N, then, being attracted by A and B, it will immediately go to N. If taken into the quadrangle a D, being attracted hy A and repelled by B, it will go to D. If taken into the quadrangle a E, it is attracted hy B and repelled by A, and vill go to E. In like manner, an atom placed in b, or in f, or in f, iſ disturhed in the smallest degree, will immediately leave that position, and will settle in one oſ the neighbouring intersections oſ limits oſ cohesion. Thus it appears that in all the interseetions oſ the ſull circles the third atom will combine with the other two, and compose a purticle oſ three atoms, having a bulk ani shape which resist a moderate changing force But an atom situated in any interval of the dotted circles eannot ſorm a porticle, but will be forced by the smallest dis- turbing ſorce to alter its situation, and assume another, in which it may compose a permanent particle It is evident that iſ the atoms A and B have many limits oſ cohesion intervening, the number oſ intersections, such as C, D, E, N, &e. must be very great, and therefore the perticle oſ three atoms is susceptible of a great variety oſ ſorms. Aſter shewing how two atoms may compose the simplest particle that is possible, it was shewn that the law oſ action oſ this particle on a third atom is extremely different from the primitive lawv which characterises an atom oſ matter, and that it was susceptible oſ a great variet. We might now proceed to shew that the action oſ a particle consisting oſ three atoms diſſers from both, and is susceptible of much greater variety. But this is s0 evident, and the detail oſ the differences would be so tedious and complicated, without terminating in any thing very general, and at the same time precise, that it is better to abstain from the discussion, and to proceed to something that will bring us more speedily to a correspondence with our observation oſ the phenomena oſ tangible matter. 285. Therefore, we shall end the whole oſ this elementary part oſf Boscovieh's theory, by shewing how it ill account for the appearance and sensible qualities of a mass oſ tangible matter. The attentive reader must have in some measure guessed at this already. Suppose the three atoms A, B, C, (fig. 7.) placed in limits oſ cohesion, composing a particle, having both length and breadth. To make the case as simple as possible, let AB, BC, and CD, be all equa. We can now suppose a ſourth atom D, above the plane ABC, and so situated as to be in limits oſ cohesion with each of the other three atoms. We may still take the most simple case possible, and suppose each oſ the triangles ADB, BDC, CDA, to be equi- lateral, and the whole to be sides of a regular tetrahedron or triangular pyramid. Here we have a particle having length, breadth, and thickness, ſit ſor being a particle oſ tangible matter. It is now evident that in the same manner that a surſace was constituted in fig. 5, a mass oſ any size and shape, having length, breadth, and thickness, may be composed of atoms, all arranged in this way, each being in the angle oſ a regular tetrahedron. This would be a mass perſectly homogeneous. It will have a certain degree oſ firmness; that is, it will resist a certain compressing or dilating force, on the withdrawing oſ which it will recover its natural bulk and shape; or it may not be perfectly homogeneous, if the tetrahedrons are not all regular, yet still having their angles situated in limits of cohesion with each of the adjoining angles, or rather with the atoms situated in them; or the atoms may be in the angles of cubes, or indeed oſ any figures whose sides are limits oſ cohesion. It is plain, that iſ the distances between these atoms be so small as altogether to escape our observation, the assemblage will appear a continuous uninterrupted hody. It will have the mechanical properties that we pereeive in all bodies. It will gravitate in proportion to the number oſ atoms contained in it, that is, in proportion to its quantity of matter. It will exhibit all the appearances oſ coherent matter, because when brought near enough to another such collection oſ atoms, the nearest atoms oſ each will act on each other with that repulsion which is seen between the ohject glasses, producing sensible contact and pressure One part oſ it being impelled, the whole will be put in motion, because the particles immediately impelled cannot move without either coming nearer to the others, or separating farther ſrom them. Either oſ these events are the occasion oſ corpuscular ſorces being excited among the particles; and those must produce motionn. We shall aſterwards see, with complete evidence, that they must produce ſhe very motions that we observr. We will be greatly assisted in our eonceptions oſ all this internal and unseen mechanism by still comparing this assemhlage oſ atoms, connected hy attracting and repelling forces, with a number oſ bodies conneeted hy spiral elastic wiress. We may suppose those hodies (so many balls) arranged in the angles oſ regular or irregular solids, till they form a eluster oſ any siz und shape. This may he considered as a magniſied representation of the piece oſ tangible matterr. A small bit of the pith oſ elder, when viewed through a microscope, will give us a very good notion of this strueture. It consists oſ a number oſ dodecaedrons, the sides of which are so thin as scarcely to be visible; and there is in each angle a little knot, connected with its neighbouring knots by visible threads, which strengthen the angles of the planess. The whole is a piece oſ heautiſul cage-work. The knots are analogous to our atoms, and the connecting threads and films, being elastie, exert contractile or protrusive ſorces, atcording as they are stretched or compressed. Such a strueture will lie on the table, will carry another, and be compressed a little by the weight. Such a colleetion will be moved by another hitting it, and the motion oſ the parts remote ſrom the part that is hit is effected solely by the elasticity oſ the conneeting springs, and this elasticity is exeited by the compression or dilatation oſ the whole strueturee The similitude in mechanic action is very accurate. 2856. It is not necessary to prosecute the theory oſ Mr Boseovieh much ſarther. It is very evident that what we have said oſ a mass composed of atoms acting on each other is equally applicable to a mass consisting oſ particles composed oſ such atoms. Such particles act on each other ns the atoms do, but the law of action, that is, the change oſ ſoree by a change of distance, must be very different. Still, however, the general ostensible results will be similar; and, since all the actions are ultimately derived ſfrom the atomical forces, and arise from their comhination, the actions of different particles must depend entirely on the manner in which their atoms are situated in respeet of each other. Thereſore, there may, and there must, be an almost infinite variety in the manner of acting oſ difſerent substances, according to the strueture oſ the particles; and all those differences will be confined to the small and insensible distances in which the atoms and particles are situated, while in all sensible distances we shall see nothing hut the attraction oſ gravitation proportional to the quantities of matter. The phenomena of solid and liquid cohesion, with all its varieties oſ soſtness, hardness, ductility, viscidity, and perſeet ſluidity, must arise ſfrom the different manner in which the atoms are arranged in forming a particlee Thus, if they are so arranged that the action of a particle is the same in every direction, varying only with a variation oſ distance, and of any degree oſ intensity, however great, the situation of one particle among the rest must he perſectly indiſſerent; and this assemblage will have the ostensible qualities oſ a ſluid. But iſ the action oſ a particle is greater in one part than in another, or greater in one direetion than in another, such particles will not take any situation, among the others indifferently. They will conlesce in one way rather than another, just as we observe a parcel oſ small magnets ſloating on quicksilver to do. These will not eluster together except in their own way. Such particles will have a sort oſ polarity. This eonstitution, in a greater or less degree, must be supposed in the particles oſ all solid, and in a still smaller degree in viscid ſluid hodies. The notions which the preceding observations enable a reſlecting nmind to ſorm oſ the construetion oſ particles, point out 1his as likely to he the most general constitution oſ tangi- ble matter; that is to say, the number oſ particles which act equally in every direction, ĩs not probably so great as that oſ particles having inequalities oſ action on the diſferent sides. For a certain determinate arrangement oſf atoms is necessary ſor the first, whereas the possible arrangements exceed all numeration. Perſect ſluidity, therefore, devoid oſ all viscidity, will be comparatively rare, and the varieties of viscid, soſt, and firm eohesion will be very great. All this is agreeable to what we observe. 287. It seems to result from the preceding observations that all bodies should he perſectly elasti. For; when a purticle AI (fig. I.) is compressed, and the compressing ſorce suddenly withdrawn, the atom I, which was compressed to some point between I and G, will immediately fly back to I with an accelerated motion; and therefore will not stop there, but will pass on towards L, till its motion is gradually reduced to nothing by the attraction oſf A. It will come back to I with an accelerated motion, pass it as ſar as heſore; and thus will oscillate ſor ever on each side oſ I, and the whole partieles will be made to vibrate. But we have seen that iſ the disturbing ſorce exceed a certain moderate quantity, the puarticle will not return to I but may go to Eor to N, fig. . And we have seen (284) that when the limits of cohesion and dissolution are very numerous, the situations in which a third atom may rest in relation to a partiele consisting oſ no more than two atoms, are still more numerous. Now, when we consider a hody as composed oſ particles, ench of which contains many atoms, it is evident that the situations where a particle may be at rest, are increased in number beyond all power oſ calculation. 288. What should be the ostensible effect oſ this constitution? If we examine the motion of the portieles by the methods laid down in dynamics, wve shall find that all bodies, when dilated or compressed by very small forces, should recover their form like perſectly elastic bodies But iſ the disturbing force has exceeded a certain quantity, which may be very diſferent in different constructions of the particles, the restituent force must be less than the changing foreethe form will not be completely restored, and the bodies must appear imperfeetly elastic; and the sensible elasticity will be so much the less as the particle has been ſorced over a greater number of limits; because it will only return to the leſt oſ those it has passed over. This is a consequence oſ the theory that is confirmed by the most extensive experiencee Mr Coulomb was engaged (for a particular purpose) in a series oſ experiments on the oscillations of springs, particularly oſ twisted wires. He suspended a nicely turned ball or cylinder by a wire oſ a certain length, and fitted it with an index, which pointed out the degrees of the torsion. He found that when a wire oſ 20 inches long was twisted ten times, the index returned to its primitive position, if repeated a thousand times, and the oscillations were made in equal times, whether wide or narrow. But if it was twisted eleven times, the index did not return to its first place, but wanted nearly, a whole turn of it. Here then the parts oſ the wire had taken new relative positions, in which they were again at rest. But what was most remarkable in Coulombs experiments was thiss. He found that aſter the wire had taken this set, (as it is termed by the artisans) it exhihited the same elasticity. as beſoree It allowed a torsion of ten turns, and when let go, it returned, and aſter its oscillations were finished, it rested in the position from which it had been taken. I was mũch struck with this experiment, and immediately repeated it on a great variety oſ substances, with the same result. The most unelastie substance that I know is soſt clay. I got a thread made oſ fine clay at a pottery, hy forcing it through a syringe It was about , th oſ an inch in dia- meter, and eleven feot longg While quite soſt, (and smeared with olive oil, to prevent its stiſſening by the evaporation of its moisture,) I ſastened it to the eeiling, and fixed a small weight and an index to its lower end. I ſound that it made 53. turns a hundred times and more, without the smallest diminution oſ it⸗ elasticty, always recovering its first position. But when I gave it seven turns, it returned only 57. Thus it took a set. In this new arrangement oſ its parts, I ſound that it again bore a twist oſ 5 turns without taking any new set. And Irepeated this several times. I then gave it ten turns, in the same direction with the first seven. It returned 54 as beſore, and was again perſeetly elastic within this limit. I thereſore look upon this consequence of Boscovieh's theory as perfectly agreeable to what we observe in tangible matter. Mr Coulomb inſers ſrom his experiments that the ultimate particles oſ hodies are perſectly elastie, and that the imperfect elasticity that we observe is owing to the particles shiſting their positions when forced too ſar ſrom their present situations. This is a very familiar and easy way oſ conceiving it, and it is very evidently the case in such a body as clay, which we can twist and ſorce into any mutual position oſ its parts. But this perſeet elasticity oſ the ultimate particles can be conceived in no other way than that described by Boseovieh. I may add that Coulomb is probably right in aseribing the shiſting oſ position slely to the pauicles, and not to the atoms oſ which they are composed. For if the atoms oſ a particle shiſt their places in the partiele, the nature and manner of acting of that particle will be changed. It is also a demonstrable consequence oſ Boseovieh's theory, that the forces which resist a change of position among the atoms, must be incomparably greater than the similar forces oſ the particles; and also that the number oſ quiescent stuntions ſor particles must be incomparably greater than ſor the atoms oſ a particlo. 289. Another appearance oſ tangible matter shews a most eneouraging conſormity to the theory When hodies are very moderately compressæd or dilated, the forces employed are proportional to the change of distance bet ween the particles TFhis appears most exactly true in the experiments of Dr Hooke, on which he ſounded his theory of springs, expressed in the phrase & tonsio sic vis, and his aohle improvement oſ pocket wathes by applying a spiral spring to the axis of the halance. which, hy ils bending and unbending, produced a forcæ proportional to the angle of the oscillations, and thereſore made them isochronous, vhether wide or narrow. It is also confirmed by the experiments of Coulomb on twisted wires; and by the form oſ the elastio curve, as determined by Bernoulli, on the supposition that the ſorces with which the particles attracted and repelled each other are proportional to their removal ſrom their nutural quiescent positions. But it is found that when the compression or dilatation is too much increased, the resistance does not increase so ſast; that it comes to a maximum hy still inereasing the strain, then decreases, and the body takes a great set, or breakss All this is perſeetly analogous to the ſorces expressed by the ordinates oſ our exponential curve. In the immediate vicinity oſ the limits oſ cohesion, the ordinates inerease nearly in the ratio of the abscissæ, then they increase more slowly, come to a maximum, deerease again, till we eome to a limit oſ dissolution. I have now sid enough, I think, ſor giving a pretty iistinet notion oſ this theory, and its competency to explain many oſ the mechanical phenomena of nature. The eurions student will not content himselſ with this slight iketeh, but will go to the work itselſ. There he vill find a most ingenious application oſ these prineiples Lo the explanation of many abstruse and curious phenomena, some voL. . r of which seem to throw unsurmountable obstacles in our way. Nothing can seem more difficult to explain than the ſree passage oſ light. The observations which have oceupied our attention are only such as relate to the more obvious mechanical changes of condition produced by the mutual action of bodies. Mr Boscovieh's notion oſ the impenetrability oſ the masses are very curious, but are omitted, as not of much service in our particular vies. 200. I may end this exhibition by saying, that it is really wonderſul how ſertile this theory appears when we apply it to the explanation of physical phenomena. All masses will have gravity proportional to and proportional to the quantity oſ matter in the mass toward which it is directed. So that on the surface oſ this earth, gold and a feather will ſall equally fast; and the pressure which we call this weight will be (sensibly) as their quantity of matter; and (which is oſ prime importance) all the mechanical actions, contemplated merely as changes of motion, will be mutual, equal, and opposite. But, in all the properties which depend on the small insensible distances, such as those in which light is reſlected, reſracted, or deſlected, the distances at which our fibres are stimulated mechanically, those oſ the palate for taste, those oſ the nostrils for smell, those of the ear for sound, those of the eye for vision, the distance at which the particles oſ the air are exerted to tremor, and rest on each other so as to propagate this tremorthe distance at which the nerves of our skin are stimulated by roughnessthe distance at which cohesions are effected in all their varietiesthe distance at which secretions, ſermentations, solutions, precipitations the action and polarity oſ particles which operate in erystallisations, and all the wonders oſ chemistry which distinguish the different kinds oſ substances,in all these distances there must be a divensity, fully adequate to ac- count for all the variety observed in the world. There does not appear the smallest necessity ſor supposing that any one primary atom of matter diſſers in any respect whatever ſrom every other atom. One and the same curve linè is the exponential of the force oſevery atom. Not only does no other seem neeessary, notwithstanding the immense variety that we observe, but it would seem that there cannot be another. It would not be agreeable to the universal fact oſ action and reaction—a ſact to hieh we know of no exception. 201. It may now be asked why so mueh time has been occupied with this theory, however ingenious? Has it any foundation in nature? Will it assist us in our future researches? Can it be that tangible hody is not that continuous uninterrupted substãnce that it is generally supposed to be, and that it is merely an assemblage oſ points, distant ſrom one another,; and as unlike a solid body as any thing we can conceive? i In answering such questions, we must always recollect that our ultimate judgments depend more immediately, or at least more certainly, on the nature oſf human intellect, than on their agreement with the state of external nature. Oſ that perhaps we have but littlee. But we ean tell what notions we can ſorm with distinetness, what are obscure, and what are incongruous, impossible, or absurd. We also know what kind of evidence produces belief, and what does peremptorily exclude it. It is certain that we aceount a piece oſ polished gold or oſ glass, to be a piece oſ continuous uninterrupted matter. There is no alternative but that it is interruptedlc. But to say that it is so is not enough. We must prove in some way or another that it is not continuouss. We see no interruption, we feel none, and thereſore may require them to be pointed out to us. As this has not heen done with the evidence of sense, it has been ſlatly reſfused, and the greatest part of philosophers hold tangible matter to be something conti- nuous, consisting oſ parts in absulute contact, and that one hody acts on another by coming into contact with iĩt. There are cases; however, in which ve lve learned to distrost our first judgments concernimg the inſormution given by our senses. Sometimes the errors of opinion proceed ſrom the imperfection oſ our senses. Thus æ gluss globe ſoiled in the usual way, appears uniſormiy resplendent by reſlected light; but ĩ held hbetween the oye and the light, we pereeive the metaãllie covering to be very partial, and that light comes through it as through a eobweb, but still ve see no pores till ve take a magniſymg glass. In other cases we ohꝶerve our error, by ĩts absolute indonsistency with judgment, formed on the most uexceptionable manner. Thus it is certain, that in muny eaes, vhere no interruption ean be observed, there are nevertheless vacuities through which other matter may puss. The hardest marble is penetruble by oil, which it imbibes, and is diseoloured by t. Gold and silver do, in like manner, imbibe mevcury. The most specious prooſ is obtaineũ by the ſree passuge oſ light through transpurent hodies. Something passes thruugh a piece oſ gluss which illuminates, which wurms, which oxygenates metals and other imſlammables; and whioh, in other cireumstances, reduces metallic oxydes; which, ini short, gives the strongest indiecution oſ its muteriality. 202. From these, and many similar ſucts, philosophers thought themselves under the neeessity o? admitting interruption in the contimuity of tangible matter, and were led to ſhe atomistic theory, which Newton first enounced with some precision, ant whie Boseovich hius reduced to æ system. Fhe philosophers oſ antiquity ãlso had some imperſect notion oſ this kind. But they went no farther than the mere division, in imugination, oſ the visible musses; into smuller purts of the same Eind, without taking any pains to shew liow the sensiblæ qualities oſ bodies could result from the mere combination of suh ſragments. Even the ebemical philosophers, who taught that there were diſſerent elementory porticles, did nothing to shew in whai those ælements difſered, or what was the principle oſ their connection, ſrom ſragments of the sensible masses. Newton atiempted this; but though bis notions have all the originality and acuteness that wæ should expeot ſrom Sir Issac Newton, they are oſfered merely as miscellaneous thoughts, without any serious attempt to support this novel opinion. Inderd those observations oſ Newton are rather aitempts to explain some of the chieſ diseriminating relations oſ diſſerent substances, than i1o estublish a general doctrinee ooncerniug the sensible ſorms of laugible matter, and the mechanieal consæquenem oſ this doctrine. ©ioseoviehs on the other hand, endeavours at once to esAablish this doetrine. Theneſore, he begins with the bold aserijon that this atomodynamical constitution oſ tangihle matter is not only a conceivable and possible thing, dit thet no oſher constitution is computible with the asEnowledged phenomena of existing matter. His obieſ argument is taken ſrom vhat is ealled the Law or conrꝶuæv. A moving point cannot pass ſrom one pont oſ space o another, wilhout pussing throngh all the intermediate points of its push in auccessionn. In like manner, a body moviog with the velocity 5 ſeat per second, cannot change this ratæ oſ motion to 4 ſeet per second, in an indivisible instant oſ 1ime, as ĩt is generally thought to do in collision, ſor that instant is the end of its motion with the vælocity 5, and the beginning oſ its motion with the vel9city 4. It is not a portion oſ time interposed hotweęn them, but the mutual boundary of both. Thereſore, to suppuse this instantaneous change, is to suppose that in that indivisible instant, the body has both the velocity, md the velocity 4, whioh is inconceivable or absurd. 298. There must thereſore he some way by whigh this impossibility is avoided. This will be accomplished only by means of a mutual ſorce, acting on hoth bodies heſore they come into contact, in the manner in which we really observe all changing ſorces to act, that is, diminishing the velocity oſ the one, and increasing that oſ the other, by insensible degreess We shall, in due time, have the ſullest prooſ that this is the case in faot, in all the changes of motion observed in this crented world; and ve may limit our inquiries to this scene. All atoms oſ matter, thereſore, must be endowed with an insuperable repulsive ſTorce, extending to some distance, which shall make the mathematical contact absolutely impossible. , It does not require much reſleetion to see that, without this supposition, the law oſ continuity must he violated in every collision of bodies. But repulsive forces alone eannot produce a mass of coherent matter. Mutual attractions are equally necessory; and, as the law oſ continuity obliged Mr Boscovieh to consider this repulsive force as acting at a small and insensible distance, it was very natural for him to consider the attractive forces as similar in Lhis respect. Having admitted this, it did not require a great deal of consideration or ingenuity to contrive a constitution, such as has been described, where the atoms should be situated at such distances ſrom one another, that when pushed nearer they should repel, aud when drawn asunder they should attract, and when at their natural distance, they should neither attract nor repel. The rest oſ his study was in order to be able to shew, by the many alternations oſ attraction and repul;ion, and by other accommodations, how, ſrom one law of action for every atom, may be derived, by composition, all the varieties oſ ſorm and oſ mutual action that we ohserve in the world around us. 294. All this was pure speculation on the part oſf Mr Boscovieh; for he does not seem to have known the muny ſacts by which this corpuscular action e distanti is confirmed. He mentions indeed the experiments of Newton on the inſlexion oſ light as it passes near sõlid bodies, and also by those by which it appears that light is reſlected and reſracted beſore it comes into mathematical contact. But he takes no notice oſ the still more precious experiments oſ Huyghens, and those oſf Newton with the object glasses Nor does he consider the phenomena of capillary attraction as any thing different ſrom mere adhesion, or as aſſording prooſs oſ action e distanti. But, in the progress oſ his discussion, many things occur, which greatly illustrate and confirm his first notions of the discrete structure of tangible matter. This theory of Mr Boscovich unquestionably receives great support ſrom the various phenomena oſ corpuseular action, which I mentioned beſore giving an account of his doctrine. His great argument ſrom the law oſ continuity will come to be considered and applied aſterwards, and, I presume, will be ſound to be oſ great forcee It was mentioned just now, merely to shew how the ingenious author vas led to ſform his theory. 295. I shall just add to all Mr Boscovich's arguments ſor the discrete structure oſf body, that I cannot form to myselſ any conception of continuous matter that is compatible with a diſference of density. If the space be completely filled, that is, iſ there be no part oſ it in which there is not matter, I cannot conceive that more matter can be put into that space, nor what can be meant by a difference in density. Yet nothing can be more convincingly ascertained than the difſerent density oſ the most solid and continuous bodiess. When we talk oſ pores in such a body as gold, or water, or air, in which none can be discovered by the senses, however assisted, I cannot see what authority we have for supposing that the ultimate particles touch one another in any points whatever. We are induced to suppose this, solely because our ſamiliar ae- great principle, the discrote constitution o matter; ani the non-existonce of mathematical contact. These two great points are not morr apposite to the suggestions oſ sen than the rotation and revoliution of the earth, which ve ſind ourselves obliged to admit, on acount oſ the incompatibility oſf the ecommon opinion with other phenomena. It is for such reasons only that the daily and onnual motion oſ the sun, and the ahmlutæ rest oſ our owa habitation, are considered as ſul)e judgments or prejuilice. The præsent question is perſeetly similor in this respect. The continuity and contaot oſ the purtioles oſ tangible matteor are io be aoounte præejudices, only because they are ineompat ile æith other unduulted phenomena, und becaus they are incompatible with the law of continuity, the violation oſ which is With respect to the imputation o revving the ocoult qualities of the peripatætios by the name oſ attraction an repulsion, the deſence is nearly the sume us in the case oſ the gravitation oſ the planets We have seen instances in which the mutual adhesion, and the mutual separation of the component purtioles oſ tangible matter æare inoontostſlile ſuots,ure general laws in nature Nothing is meant by attraction and repulsion but the immerdiate æſficient causæs of those ſhenomena. A philosopher may suy thut the deſlection oſ a planet is effected by the action of an etheridl vortex. Hæ may and he must say the same thing hore.. But it may then he asked him how this other proiduces the deflection? He will probably say that it ĩs in the same way that a stream of water or wind, or even a strenm of sand, vould deſlect the motion oſ any budy that it striess But I apprehend that 1his answer oſ the philosophers, which has long been thought complete, is now rendered altogether invalid. For we have seen that it eunnt he shewn that one hody ever really ætrikes another, even when it puts it into motion. The ether is empſoyed, because it is a ſact that a hody oſ sensible magnitude impels another heſore it comes into mathematical contact. Thereſore, since we have no evidence that one body really hits another, ve cannot say that a particle oſ this ether hits the hody. Another ether is thereſore necessary for explaining ils impulse, iſ an ether be necessary for explaining the impulse oſ the sensible body; and we must have a third ether to aceount for the action oſ the second, &e. &e. &. There is no end to this kind of mechanism. In short, active powers, diſſerent from the stroke oſ a moving body, must be admitted, whatever origin we assign to them, and we must add them to our notions oſ mechanism, and no longer limit the term mechanical explanation to an explanation by impulsion and contact. The manner in which both gravitation and impulsion are eſſected, will probably always remain unknown, but the approach and the separation are not occult qualities, but maniſest phenomena; and both are accompanied by that pressure which we and all mankind have heen accustomed to call a force, which is therefore another maniſest phenomenon, and not an occult quality. Iſ better names can he ſound ſor them let them be employed, but nttraction and repulsion seem to distinguish the phenomena very clearly. There seems no reasonable ohjeetion against extending the action oſ these forces to the particles, and even to the atoms, although it must be acknowledged that we do not s0 clearly see their operation on those particular subjects. But surely, when a mass oſ tangible matter is compressed or dilated, the actual exertion oſ ſorces, opposing the approach or separation of the particles, is as distinetly perceivable as in the similar experiments of Newton and Huyghens, although in this last case the actual approach and recess oſ the subjects are seen, and can he measured, while in the first these motions are altogether imperceptible in the subjects which are thus moved.. The cases are s0 analogous that it is ſastidious to reſuse admitting the same mode oſ explanation. 297. Perhaps more solid objections may be made to one circumstance oſ Mr Boscovich's theory He holds his atoms to he unextended mathematical points. I cannot ſorm any notion oſ one oſ these as an individual subject, different ſrom the notion I have oſ a mere point of gpace. The individuality oſ a point of space consists in its being thut purticular point oſ space, so and so situated with respect to certain other points of space. This individual point oſ space is thereſore immovable. Surely, thereſore, the active powers ascribed to matter are conceived as the endowments, or the attendants oſ something that is diſſerent ſrom a mere point of space. I am hy no means certain that this inextension of an atom is indisputably requisite in a theory which maintains 1he discrete constitution of matter. Far less am I certain that it is necessary ſor the truth oſ this constitution, and Aor its utjlity in philosophical discussion, that I should perſectly understand the nature oſ this subject or substratum oſ the active powers oſ matter. But neither ean I, on the other hand, conceive those powers to have no substance to which they belong, or to which they are related, æither intrinsically or extrinsically. I cannot conceive one set oſ attractive and repelling powers putting another set in motion by impulse. These are words without ideas. It is not likely that human intelleet will either acquire more adequate knowledge oſ the subject, or that it will ever be able to divest itself of the thought that there is a substance in which those powers are inherent. 2098. Notvithstanding this limitation and imperſeetion oſ our knowledge oſ this suhject, we shall find several consequences oſ this manner of considering the mechanical relation oſ the parts oſ tangible matter, which we may employ with confidence, to help us in our inquiries; and I trust that T may be able by this help to illustrate many things which would otherwise have been very ohseure. But, at the same time, I am aware that the most scrupulous caution must be continually observed in making use oſ this help. We must at all times avoid forming any general conclusions without firmly establishing, by mathematical reasoning, the individual fact which we make the basis of our inference; and we must never trust our imagination in its riews oſ the combined motions or actions oſ many purticles or atoms, except in cases where we can demonstrate the legitimaey oſ such procedure. I should even add that the diffieulties in this study of corpuseulor attraction and repulsion have been greatly augmented by s0mæ late discoveries. The action which we are now considering is limited to the smuall and insensible distances in which the particles of tangible matter are situated in respect oſ one another; nnd the doctrine which I am now prosecuting considers the conpuscular ſorcæ as depending, both as to kind and degree, solely on the distance and position of the acting particless. No&, in that numerous and important class of phenomena which are known hy the name of galvanie, there occur corpusouler actions which seem altogether ĩnæxplicable on those principles. We see a wire, he remote ænd of which communicates with the positive pole of Volias pile, attmot to ĩtselſ the particles oſf metal which ane ſloating round it in the solution. Now let the remote end oſ this wire communicate with the other pole, of the pile. In an instant the action oſ the wire is totully changed; it mo longer attracts the metal, and even seoms to repel it. Yet there is no change in the distance anũ position oſ the acting particles. Tknow that magnetism presents phenomena vhich are extremely similar, and which we ean explain in perſect consistency with the laws oſ attraction and repilsion; hut the admission oſa similar explanation in the ꝑresent case, gives a ænmplexity to the question which almost blasts all our hopes. 299. Notwithstanding ſhis discouragement, ſhis department of science is deserving of the most eareful cultivation. All the changes oſ material nature, when anaIysed to the utmost, are examples of matter inſluenced hy moving ſorces. This is the case even when the sunshine discharges some gay vegetable colour; some matter is moved ſrom its ſormer place, and takes a new arrangement. The phenomenon would be completely explained, could we, ſrom our knowledge oſ the law oſ action of the ſorces, tell the path oſ the removed atom, and its motion in that path, as we can do in the case of the moon. We are not without encouragement, even in this perplexed research. We are obtaiming now and then pretty distinct traces oſ general lawss. We have ſound that the mutual action oſ the particles oſ such gasses as we have been able to conſine and measure, is nearly proportional to the density oſ the gas in its difſerent states oſ compression; and thereſore it diminishes nearly in the proportion that the distance oſ the particles increases. We hare also found that there is a great difference in the las oſ aetion in diſſerent gasses in the moment oſ their produetion ſrom a solid or liquid hody. Thus the gas produced hy the inſlammation oſ gunpowder exhibits an elasticity nearly proportional to its density, through the whole range of its expunsion. Hut the gas produced from fulminatim” gold, silver, or mercury, shews an action oſ the particle which diminishes much more by an increase oſ distance. Seorcely any barrel is able to withstand their explosion, yet they huve not half of the ſoree for impelling a ball by their continual expansion along the bartel 300. I ohserved, on another occasion, that a certain seet of philosophers insist that all ſorces difſused ſrom a eentre decrease in the inverse duplicate ratio oſ the distances; and that i any other law is ohserved, ĩt arises ſrom the manner in which different atoms, acting by this primordial law, are combined. But this will not agree with many phenomena of tangible matter. If the primordial force be proportional to x the action oſ all compound x particles must decrease more slowly, and be proportional l . ; to Now we are certain that there are many x ſorces which decrease ſaster than in the ratio of and : l must be proportional to n The phenomena of cohesion in hard and brittle bodies much more resemble the efſects oſ a force proportional to ſor at the smallest sensible distance the cohesion vanishes entirely. The action of aurum or argentum ſulminans undoubtedly del creases ſaster than Fũ The observations contained in the first part of this artiele give suſficient authority for concluding, that the parts of what we have called tangible matter are related to each other in a way which greatly resembles the mechanism deseribed by Mr Boscovich; so that this deseription may be of considerable service in our subsequent exammations oſ those changes oſ motion that are produced by the actions of sensible masses on one another. It directs us to a way oſ conceiving the connection of the distant parts oſ a hody, without which we shall in vain look ſor a satisſactory explanation of some ſfundamental truths. Ofſ this we. shall soon have full evidence. 301. I cannot help taking notice oſ a perſormance which has been repeatedly announced in our periodical publieations, as ready for the press, by the title of Recherches Mothematiques sur la constitution intime des Corps. Par A. G. Bu?©. An index or precis of the work has also been some time in circulationn. The author proſesses to ex- plain the intimate strueture and constitution oſ tangible matterr. He builds his whole system on the following proposition, which ascertains the primordial property oſ matter, by which alone all the phenomena oſ the visible universe are effected and explained. FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM. Any tuo elements of matter will, in virtue of their mere exisience, mutually approach each other in every instunt, ly a space which is inversely proportional to the square of their distunce. The author does not indeed say that they must so approach. His only meaning seems to be, that iſ there be any relation of approach or recess mutual between them, this must be its characterr. The momentary change of place must be inversely proportional to the square of their mutual distancee Having demonstrated this ſundamental theorem, the very ingenious author proceeds to explain, that is, to account ſor all the phenomena of the material world, the phenomena oſ cohesion, in all its varieties oſ hardness, soſtness, ductility, elasticity, ſluidity; and the phenomena of magnetism, electricity, chemical aſfinity, opties, &e. &e. Mr Bue is an expert and elegant algebraist, and has given a vast apparatus oſ the most reſined equations, ex, pressing the mechanical possibilities oſ naturee In particular, he gives une equation finule, which expresses the UxiversE touts les faits possibles” He then applies these equations to particular cases, and says that this and that phenomenon are explained, that is, are shewn to be necessary results from this primitive essential property oſ matterr. Then comes his chieſ question, If, among all the possibilities expressed by his final  oquation, a certain number tally exacily with the sume num-  Ber of the observed phenomena of ihe universe, hat is the sdegree of probubility thot the iypothesia is fals ? To answer this question, the author now nlunges into the depths of Condoroets, Caltul des probobilites; and, after several pages oſ the most abstracted and general equations that can be imagined, and in which all physical ideas have quitted the mind, he makes it as clear as sunshine that the probability isO!ll Q. E. . The phenomena are now held as explained. The inevitable conclusion which must, I think, ſollow from these ingenious lahours is, that the universe canuot be any thing but what we see it to hee. We have the good ſortune to exist during one of those possible ſorms into which matter, aſter acting and reacting, during ages oſ ages, haus worked itself into a shape whieh may endure for ever. I have studied, with the utmost eare and attention, this author's demonstration oſf this his fundamental proposition. I cammot say that it is not demonstrated; because I confess that I cannot ſorm any distinet notion, either oſ his reasoning, or oſ the principles ſrom which he reasons. I am willing to think that I misunderstand him; but I have given the proposition in his own wordss I shall grant that it ſlows legitimately ſrom his prineiles. l ' 302. But it is surely very singular that this primordial law oſ nature, essential to matter, and the ſoundation oſ all its properties, should not be oliserved in one single phenomenon of naturee. The author assumes and employs it under the name of the law oſ gravitation, the discovery oſ Sir Isanc Newton. But I apprehend thet he is ofſ his guard in this instance. Although an expert and elegant analogist, he does not seem to be aware that the proposition which he has demonstrated differs ioto eælo ſrom the law of gravitationn. This is remarhable; for I think that the mathematical roader ill pereeive ithat the proposition which Mr Bue considers as demonstrated is, that the velocity oſ the gravitating atom is inversely as the square of its distance ſrom the atom toward which it gravitates and approaches. For the litile space, through which it approuches in every instant, is adopted by every mechanician as the measure of the velocity. But in gravitation, it is not the velocity, but the acceleration, that is inversely as the square oſ the distance. I do not know one spontaneous phenomenon oſ nature, in which Mr Bue"s proposition is observed. Thus will it always ſare with us when we attempt to reason about the ſoundation oſ the powers of nature Mr Bue' has heard oſ this my ohjeetion; but it is in vain to make a refonte de Vouvrage, as I hear he is attempting. He must not shiſt his ground. IF he has demonstrated this proposition, he can demonstrate no other ſfrom the same principles; and he must search ſor some other prooſ of the law oſ gravitation, which he has shen, by this proposition, to be incompatible with the primordial property of matter. I may here observe that Mr Bues ingenious explanation of many phenomena is not in the least hurt by this blundering propositionn. He might have simply stated as a universal ſact, that all matter gravitates, in the manner described hy Newton, and he might then have applied this to the explanation of other phenomena, preeisely as he has done; and the explanations would still have all thal merit of great ingenuity, although I must consider them Bs altogether romantic and ſanciſul. 303. In the ſarther consideration oſ the mechanical phenomena oſ nature, as they are modified by the addition oſ the ſorce of cohesion, it is necessary to divide the subjects oſ our examination into two classes, depending on the manner in which the particles are combined, so as to ſorm masses oſ tangible matter. Those are either solid or ſluid. Solid bodies are such as retain a certain shape vOL. I. v and resist (to speak metaphorically) in a certain degree, the forces which are employed to change this shape. Fluids exhihit no such firmness, and must be kept in vessels, otherwise their gravity would cause them to spread abroad on the ground. We shall first consider The Mechanism of Solid Bodies. The experiments with the object glasses, to which reference has been s0 oſten made, shew us that any piece of solid matter acts on another, at a very minute distance, with a repulsive ſorce so great that we have no evidence that it can be overcome by any ſorce that we ean employ. This force was perceived in those experiments at a distance not less than the 5000th part of an inch, and it probably extended considerably ſarther, but with a diminished intensity. We are ſully warranted to say that the repulsion manifest in those experiments is the immediate cause oſ the physical contact of bodies, and is the foree which we call pressuree By this repulsion, bodies act on our external fibres and nerves, and occasion in us the sensation of touch, or what we call ſeeling This is perhaps our clearest notion of ſoree of any kind. Gravity is perceived as an agent by the pressure of a heavy body on our hand; yet this pressure is not the agency oſ gravity, but of the corpuscular repulsion we are now considering. Gravity, by ſorcing the heavy body near enough to our hand, gives occasion to this repulsion, which most persons imagine to be the heaviness or weight oſ the hody. Being the cause of our sensation of touch, this repulsion gives us our first and most ſamiliar notion oſ solidity, firmness, oſ corporeality. It is even the immediate cause oſ the philosophical notion oſ solidity, materiality, impenetrahility, that is, the maintenance of the place occupied, exclusive oſ all other matter. One piece oſ matter cannot occupy a space already occupied by other mat- ter, exeept by thrusting that other matter out oſ the space filled by it. So many ſunctions entitle this peculiar modiſfication of corpuscular force to a very careſul attention and study. 304. It appeared that the distance which produces physical contact is vastly greater than that in which adhesion and capillary attraction are exerted, and is therefore vastly greater than the distance at which the particles of the solid bodies coheree Consequently, when one oſ those hodies is so0 near to another as to act on it, the actions oſ many particles oſ the one on many particles oſ the other are comhined. Hence we derive a fundamental proposition. 305. The mutual action oſ two solid bodies in physical contact is always in the direetion perpendicular to the common plane oſ contact. Let AB Plate III fig. S. be the surſace oſa solid body, and let us suppose that the corpuscular force acts on a particle at all distances that do not exceed a certain line X. Let P be an external particle, whose distance ſrom the surſace AB is less than X. Let OCDE be a sphere whose centre is in the particle P, and whose radius is equal to X. It is plain that a part CDE oſ this sphere is occupied by the matter of the body. Every purticle, therefore, contained in the spherical segment CDE acts on the particle P, and it is not acted on hy any particle that is beyond the surſace oſ this spheree Now, suppose that the particle F repels P, in the direction, and with the force PH. There is another particle G, similarly situated on the other side oſ the perpendicular PD. It must repel P in the direction PI, and the measure PI oſ this force must he equal to PH, because the distance PG is equal to PF. The ſorces PIT and PI ecompose a force PK, the direction of which must evidently be perpendicular Lo the surſace AB. Whoat has now heen demonstrated concerning the action on one particle P, is true oſ the action on every purticle acted upon; and it is easily demonstrated to be true with respect to the action compounded oſ all those actions, and therefore the proposition is maniſest. The attentive render will remark that this demonstration proceeds on the perſect equality oſ action of the particles F and G. This supposes that no particle such as will be ſound within this spherical segment CDE which has not a companion G, similarly situated on the other side oſ the perpendicular PD; or, in other worãs, it supposes that all within this spherical segment is homogeneous. This, it must he owned, cannot be affirmed universally. But the sphere of this particular corpuscular ſoree, which is the cause oſ physical and sensible contact, and impulsion, is so great in comparison with the natural distance oſ the particles, that we may reckon upon the homogeneity of the segment without the risk of any sensible error. There will be some irregularity, but in the small space of the 2000th or 5000th oſ an inch, it cannot be considerable; and the average motion will be, to all sense, perpendicular to the surſace, just as gravity is to all sense perpendicular to the surface of the oeean, notwithstanding the mountains and other inequalities whieh occasion deviations and inequalities in natural gravitationn. We cannot discover the irregularities in the case now beſore us as ve cun those oſ gravity. Yet we shall, aſter this, meet with some instances oſ them which cannot be disputed. 306. The question now is, whether this theoretical deduction ſrom our notions oſ corpuseular action is agreeable to what we really observe. In answer to this, it must be observed that we cannot make the examination with such precision as we have been aceustomed to in our astronomical discussionss. When we recollect that the sphere oſ action cannot greally exeeed the 4000th part oſ mn inch, it is evident that we may be mistaken in our notion oſ the exact position oſ the common plane of contact. A serateh, or inequality, that we cannot perceive by the eye, may change the position in the point oſ contact unnoticed by us. But still, the experience which we have oſ this matter is abundantly agreeable to our proposition, and indeed may be pronounced accurately so. I know nothing that shews this more eclearly than the motion of the balls on the billiard tablee. Thus, suppose a ball A fig. 9. impelled in the direction A o, and that another ball B lies partly in its way, so that it cannot pass without striking it. Suppose that in the instant of contact, the plane Cę is the common tangent to both balls The ball B will not move in a direction parallel to A a, but in the direction Bb, perpendicular to Ce. A person who has never seen the action oſ elastic balls in collision will be much surprised at seeing the ball t>ke a direetion so unexpected. In like manner, iſ a series oſ balls, such as are æępresented in fig. I0. be struek by a ball moving in the direction A a, the last ball C of the series will be drawn off in a direction Ce, perpendicular to the plane D d, which is the common tangent to C and the next ball. There is generally, however, a small deviation ſrom the perpendicular toward the direction oſ the striking ball. Thus in fig. 9. the ball B does not move exactly in the perpendicular B b, but in a direction B ⸗, a little nearer to the direction A . But this is owing partly to imperſect elasticity, and partly to some frietion by which the ball A drogs a little into its given path the hall which it strikes. But in very elastic ivory balls this deviation is scarcely sensible. 307. There is another instance, in which the greatest precision in the direction and intensity oſ the ſorce is necessary for insuring the intended efſect, and where the complete success shews the truth oſ the principle on which the artist proceeds. This is in the construetion oſ the pallets oſ a elock or watch. Fig. l. represents the swing wheel oſ a clock, urged round in the direction DEF by the rest of the wheel-work. It is prevented ſrom running round by the point of the tooth A stopping on the pallett. This point oſ the tooth is urged ſorward in the direction oſ the tangent A.. A force in this diTrection would have little tendency to make the pallet turn round its centre G. But its action on the face of the pallet being in the direetion A a perpendicular to that surface, pushes it outward, causing it to turn round G. In like manner, the tooth B, moving in the direction B would have no tendency to make the pallet turn round G. But the action heing in the direction B b, has a proper eſficacy for this purpose. Many other examples may be had in the construetion oſ machines. It may be remarked here, that there is nothing in which the genius and sagacity oſ an engineer is more certainly seen than in his attention to this maxim, and there is no article of practical mechanies that is more imperſectly understood by proſessional men. It is most ævident that a right employment oſ this proposition is oſ the greatest importance in all machinery; for it is by such mutual contacts and pressures that all their motions and perſormances are eſſectedl. The proposition is by no means obvious, and the practice which it preseribes is ſrequently the most unlike to what our common notions would suggest to us, as in the two examples that have been given. 308. This proposition, when duly employed, makes a great change in the manner in which mechanieal problems have been treated. Thus, in explaining the motion oſ a body which is impelled in the direction AB (fig. 12.) by a ſoree AB, but which cannot move exeept along the solid path AC, the usual way is thiss The force AB may be resolved into a ſorce AC, in the direction which the body can really take, and a foree AD perpendicular to that direetion. This last ſorce neither promotes nor op- poses the motion in the direction AC, and thereſore the body moves as i impelled by AC alonee. All this is very just in abstracto, and the motion is truly ascertained. But it is not a narration oſ the procedure of nature. There is no such resolution of ſorces, hut, on the contrary, a compositionn. We are not now engaged in an abstract proposition of dynamies, but in some natural question. Why cannot the body move in the direction AB? Because it is hindered by a solid body, on which it presses, and which reacts in a direction perpendicular to the touching surſacee The motion which it takes is the diagonal of a parallelogram, one of whose sides is AB, and the other has the direction AE perpendicular to the path AC. Thereſore draw BC perpendicular to AC, and complete the parallelogram ABCE, oſ which AC is the diagonal, and the expression oſ the ſorce actually compounded of the motive ſorce AB, and the reaction AE really exerted by the path in the point A, but nowhere else. The compound ſorce causes the body to move along AC without any more pressure on the path, or any more reaction; whereas in the common way oſ considering the question, the resolution oſ the force is supposed continual, and thereſore the pressure continual. We shall meet with many cases where the investigotion has been made extremely diſficult by treating it in an abstracted manner, whereas it would have been extremely easy, had it been considered as nature presents it to our observation. 309. Having thus ascertained the direction in which an external atom, corpuscle, or larger mass oſ solid, that is firm matter, is acted on by another, we at the same time learn the direction oſ the reaction of that external body. It is also perpendicular to the touching surfaces. The natural consequence oſ this information seems to be, that when an external body is thus acted on (7e shall suppose it repelled,) it will be made to move oſſ in that direetion. Accordingly we see it 50 impelled, in the instance oſ the billiard bal. There seems nothing more necessary ſor explaining the whole efſect. True, it has heen perhaps only one sensible point oſ the body that has been so impelled. But as the body is solid, hard, and in a manner impenetrable, this impelled point eannot move oſf without pushing all the rest beſore it. We see no diſficulty in this; and there seems nothing more wanting. But there is a great deal yet unexplainedc One particle only has been impelled; a small force suſfices ſor moving one particlee. How eomes a reaction to be perceived as great as iſ each particle oſ the body had been separately acted on. The inertia oſ the most remote purticle must he overeome, and its particular reaction seems to he exerted by the single particle- that has really been impelled. It would seem that a part of the whole ſorce employed has been somehow propagated through the substance oſ the hall to each oſ its particles, and also that the reaction of each of those particles has heen propagated backwards to the particle really acted on, and that all these reactions have heen exerted by this single particle. But I do not think that we can conceive force to be a thing which can be transſerred in this manner from one particle to another, or shared among the difſerent particles of a body, as salt or sugar may be diffused through water. Our notion of the nature oſ force will never be very clear. But, besides this obscurity, we see that what has been hitherto said will not explain many cireumstances oſ the motion produced hy ueting on one part only oſ a solid body. In some cases we see the impelled body move straight forward in the direction that we expect; but in other cases it not only goes forward, but also turns briskly round; and a proper attention will shew l us that this combination oſ progressive and rotative motion is regulated by laws as steady as any in mechanies. There are principles, thereſore, by which this propagation oſ moving ſorce is regularly modiſied. 310. There is no such propagation of ſoreee The mited motion oſ the whole impelled body is an example oſ the excilement of those corpuscular ſorees which connect the particles oſ tangible matter. Iſ the action or pressure has heen great, and the body large, and of very tender ſriable texture, ve often see that it is not all moved, although its parts are as universally in contact as those oſ another body which moves oſf completely by the same action. A hlow given to a metal candlestick will Enock it over. The same blow given to a china candlestick will probahly leave the foot oſ it where it was, and the stalk only is knocked ofſ. Why this difſerence? Why is the foot leſt behind? There has been a deſiciency of connecting forcee. A hempen cord will twiteh into rapid motion a large bul. But if we give the same sudden tug by means oſ a slender thread, we shall leave the hall behind, ſor the thread will be broken. Sueh examples shew pretly clearly how the motion oſ the remote part oſ the hody is efiected, either by pushing or pulling. It is the pressure of the lust particle oſ the rod or rope that moves the ball; that pressure was brought into action by stretching the rope, or comprussing the rod. Something drew Ahe last particle but one oſ the rope a little way from the very last, and thereſore brought into action, or exeited the attractive foree which is inherent in, or always accompanies the particles when at that particular distance from each other. What was this something? It was this: the last particle but two was drawn away ſrom the last but one, and thereſore attracted it, and drew it avay ſrom the last. . 311. As I apprehend it to be oſ great importance that we have very clear and precise notions of the manner in which the sensible forces which connect the particles oſ matter are brought into action by the action oſ external forces, I shall employ a little time in endeavouring to render it plain. Let a æ (fig 13.) be a single row oſ eohering atoms or particles, without weight, in a vertical position, and at their natural unconstrained distances ſrom each other. Also let M be a material horizontal plane in physieal euntact with the row aæ. Now let the uppermost particle a recover its weight. It cannot remain in its present position, because it has no support. For we supposed the particles to be in their natural inactive distances. It is not acted on, that is, iĩt ĩs not supported by 5. It must thereſore descend by its gravity, and eome s0 much nearer to b that b repels it with a ſoree equal to its weight. a is now supported. But as b is supposed to act on a, ũ acts on b, and pushes it from its place toward c, thereſore b cannot rest, or be in equilibrio, till it is as much repelled by c as by a. It therefore comes nearer to c, and is ſollowed by . But when e in this manner repels b, enabling it to support a, b repels c, pushing it nearer to d, and c cannot rest till it is as near t0 d as it is to 5. But d is acted on by c as c was by b, and is made to approach to e and repel it. Without repeating the same thing oſ every particle, it is evident that all the particles, ſrom b to M inclusive, will be brought 20 much nearer to one another that their mutual repulsion is precisely equal to the weight oſ a, and the last particle æ acts on the plane M with the same ſoree Thus the plane M is said to carry the weight oſ . But this is incorrect. The plane sustains a pressure equal to that weight; but it is the exerted elasticity or repulsion inherent in 2, but dormant, till excited by the diminution oſ its distances. Now let b become heavy. It will descend and come still nearer to c, till the increase oſ cs repulsion is equal to the weight oſ b, and the whole repulsion exerted by ⸗ is equal to the sum of the weights of a and b. b is now repelling c with an equal forcee Therefore c must approach d till their mutual repulsion is equal to the sum oſ the weights oſ a and b It is evident that an equilibrium will not be established over the whole row oſ particles till all are as near to one another as b is to c. æ will be at this distance ſrom M, and M will sustain a pressure equal to the sum of the weights oſ a and b; a pressure which we may call 2. Now let c also have weight. Without repeating all that has been said, it is very plain that the equilibrium will be re-established when c and all below it are so near one another as to exert a repulsion which we may call 3, and M sustains a pressure 3. b still presses with a ſorce 2, and a with a foree I. Prosecuting the examination in this way, it is obvious that the particles will be compressed so much the more as they are ſarther down in the row. æ will press the plane with a foree 24, 5 will press on æ with a force 23, æ will press y with a ſoree 22, &e. &e., and a will still press with the ſorce I, the action of its elasticity, occasioned by its heaviness We are warranted to say so, because we know that all tangible matter is elastic, and is actually compressed by its weight, and when it is so compressed, it is its springyness, and not its weight, that is the immediate agent in this pressure We may even doubt (however diſficult it may be to rid ourselves oſ the inſluence of hahits) whether a would press at all, merely in consequence oſ its weight. For it is not, surely, from any previous knowledge oſ the nature of matter that we believe that a foro oſf any kind can be transmitted through a piece oſ continuous matter, any more than through empty spacee We have abundant evidence that this is the way in which the weight oſ bodies is ſelt and supportedlc. We see that when substances which are very compressible are collected in a great heap, the lower portions are more compacted than what lies above them. Thus cotton wool or sheeps wool, when heaped very high, is much compressed at the bottomm We know common air is in a very compressed state, and presses on every square ineh oſ the containing vessel with a foree oſ nearly I5 poundss. We call this the pressure oſ the atmospheree. But it is really the elasticity oſ the air (occasioned indeed by its heaviness) that is pressing on the vessel. For, by shutting the cock in the upper part of the vessel, all communication with the atmosphere is cut off Yet the air presses as mueh as beſore, and presses the lid of the vessel upward as mueh as it presses the bottom downwardss. Thereſore it is the inherent elasticity oſ the air that presses, and not the weight of the atmosphere. In like manner, it is the inherent elasticity or repulsive ſorce oſ the particle æ that thus presses on the plane M. 312. Having thus explained what is usually ealled the propagation oſ a dead pressure, I apprehend that it will be easy to conceive how a moving force is propagated through a coherent body. We have a similar excitement of corpuscular forces produced hy the compression occasioned in one part oſ the solid mass, by the external ſoree opplied to that part. In short, this excitement must obtain over the whole cord, beſore the hall can be moved. The model (so to eall it) which I deseribed in § 310, will give the most distinct notion oſ this general excitement of force, vhether they he pressures or tractions. Let the rod or cord be represented by a single row oſ little balls a, b, c1, (ſig. 14.) connected by screw wires. At one end æ it touches the body M which I would push away. I press on the other end a. This ſorces the ball a a little nearer to b, and a and b now repel one another, and b is pushed a little nearer to c, while I continue to press a forward. Thus c is repelled by b, and moves a little a neorer to d, and repels it. This goes on all the way to 2, which is in contact with the body M. This will not yield till pressed with a certain foreee This force can only be had in the elasticity oſ the spring which connects 5 with 2. This spring must be compressed: the only means ſor doing this is to compress the spring which unites æ and 4. This must obtain the whole way between æ and a. All the springs must be exerting protrusive ſorce; thereſore, all must be compressed, and in this simple case, all must be equally compressed. Iſ any of them break, the hody M is not moved. In this model (let me still call it so) there is no propogation of a force originally in a to the other end of the series, nor any propagation backwards of the reaction of the body to be moved. All is efſected by the excitement oſ the elasticity of the springs, and the compression caused by my pressure js the occasion for this excitement. The body M is not moved by the pressure of my hand propagated through the model, but solely hy the elasticity oſ the spring v2. My hand is not resisted by the inertia oſ the body M propagated backwards to a, but solely by the elasticity of the compressed spring a b. This model is a more perſect representation oſ nature than yet appears. Each little ball o? which it consists may represent a porticle oſf matter We may remove M entirely. In this case, the spring v æ will be no ſurther compressed than suſſices ſor exciting an elasticity able to remove the pagiicle 2z. A very little will suffice for this But the spring æ 5 must be twice as much compressed; it must be compressed as much as  z, in order to move y, and as much more, in order to compress y ⸗. In like mammer, the spring wæ must be thrice as much compressed as v æ, and the spring o w must be ſour times os much compressed; and the spring a b must be twentyſour times as much. I shall feel thereſore a reaction equal to what I should have ſelthad T applied my hanũ to the whole 24 balls, and had urged them intb the same motion. But this is not the reaction oſ each ball propagated backward, but solely the great elasticity oſ the spring a b occasioned by its great compression. 313. When we urge a soſt clay ball into quick motion by a stroke, or by the continued pressure oſ a rod, or by a spring, without striking it, e always observe that it is ſlattened or dimpled. Thus, if a strong spring be coiled up and held by a cateh, and we lay a clay ball on it, and disengage the catch, the spring unbends and draws avay the ball. Iſ it fall into water and be picked up, we shall find it very much ſlattened and dimpled by the spring: 50 much the more as the unbending oſ the spring was more rapid. How was this done? The ball got no blow; and mere lying on the spring did not dimple it. This will be still more sensibly seen, iſ the ball he impelled like a boy's trap-ball. The trapstick is 5truck at A, (Plate IV. fig.1.) and motion round the fulerum C ſollows, and B is drawn oſf, but without any stroke; yet B is just as much dimpled as if the blow had been given it without any intervention. This impulse then is effected entirely by the same repulsive ſorce which made B lie on the end of the trapstick without tonching it. We have no evidence that it touched it when drawn off; nay though it may have heen shattered to pieces. Remark also that in the example mentioned above of the bent spring, we know that the motion was impressed on the ball by insensible degreess We gan tell the velocity acquired in every part oſ the motion till it quitted the spring. 314. Thus the model has given us a very clear notion of the procedure of nature; and it is a very accurate notion, and nowise misleads us. Nay, IT must now say that it is not a model, but a real example, perſectly similar to the putting any piece of solid matter in motion. For all solid bodies that we are acquainted with have some elasti- city, and mutual pressures are exerted all over them, whether by compression or dilatation. If, thereſore, we limit our inquiries to the phenomena of the existing creation of God, our information is correct and adequate. The question now is, hether our dynamieal knowledge enables us to establish general principles which may suſfice for explaining the phenomena, and ſor rendering this Enowledge useſul by increasing our power. I apprehend that it is, and that in this investigation we shall obtain muceh help ſrom Father Boscovieh's manner of considering these corpuscular forcess We shall thus discover some very general and simple laws by which this excitement oſ corpuscular ſoree is regulated. A very evident way of obtaining this knowledge will be to inquire, what analogy or relation there is between the ſorce applied to one point oſ a solid body and the ſorce that is thereby excited in another point of the body. We shall learn this again by discovering what external ſorce will exactly balance the ſorce thus excitel. For the ſorce excited must be equal to this external ſorce, and must be in the opposite direction. The elementary doctrines on this subject may he comprehended in the ſollowing propositions. 83I5. lst. When any number of ſorces are in equilibrio by the intervention oſ a solid body, they are sueh as would be in equilibrio if they were all acting on a single atom. A mass of solid matter may be the means oſ selting two or more forces, such as pressures, impulses, or mere solicitations, to motion, in seeming opposition to one another. That is, ench may be prevented ſrom producing that change oſ motion in the body which it would have produced had the other forces been away. This is called setting the ſores in equilibrio with each other, and the forces are then said to balance each other. But it would be more proper to say that the body is in equilibrio. This however is but a seeming opposition of the ſorces. A ſorce cannot he in equilibrio with another unless both are applied to the same point. I another equal force be applied to the same point, in the opposite direction, all change oſ motion is prevented. Thereſore when two ſorces are applied, and no change oſ motion ensues, we must conelude that these two ſorces are equal and opposite. In applying these observations to the present question, thereſore, we must say that any one oſ the external forces, such as A, Plate IV. fig. 2. is in equilibrio, not with another oſ the external ſorces BB, but with the corpuscular forees which connect the rest oſ the hody with the point or with the atom to which A is applied. In like manner, each of Ahe other external ſorces is in immediate equilibrio, only with the foree exerted by the point to which it ĩs applied, which ſoree is the corpuscular ſorce conneeting that particle with the rest oſ the body. Also we may say, in general, that the force exerted hy any one of those particles is not a simple ſorce, but the combined action of all the particles with which the particle acted on is immediately connectedl. This must be the case ninety-nine times in the hundred. The foree exerted by the particle acted on by the external ſorce, is the equivalent of all those immediately connecting forcess. Now we have seen that when forces are thus excited in distant parts, the excitement must take place over all the intervening particles, perhaps diſſerently in each. We have supposed all the forces to be in equilibrio. Thereſore the equilibrium must obtain over all. For if any particle be not in equilibrio, it will not remain in its present sĩtuation, contrary to our supposition of perſect rest over al. The equilibrium thereſore is genera. Now consider how this equilibrium is produced. Every particle is attracting or repelling its adjoining particles, and is equally attracted or repelled by them. Thereſore the whole corpuscular ſorces are made up oſ puirs, and in each pair the two forces are equal and opposite. It is evident that iſ all thes corpustular ſorces wer upplied to one point they would be in equilibrio, because each is opposed by its equal. But it has been demonstrated that vhn a number òſ ſorces, acting on one point, arè in equilibrio, iſ they be divided into pareels, the equivalents oſ those parcęls would be in equilibrio if applied to one point. Now, in the present case, the ſorces exerted by the diſferent points to which the external forees are applied, are each the aquivalenis of parcels oſ the corpuscular forces exertàd all over the hody. Thereſore these equivalents would he in equilibrio iſ all were applied to onè point. But each oſ thoe equivalents is equal and opposite to the external foro? with which it is in immediate equilibrium: Thereſore these external ſorces are such as would be in equilibrio iſ all were applied to one point. Such is the general law. But, in order that this may obtain, in order that the precise foroes may be exortud whioh will produce this equilibrium, the body will assume certain positions or attitudes depending on the direction and intensity oſ the externãl forces. Those conditions ill comb into view by eonsidering some 6ſ the most simple cases oſ this general law. 816. d. If the body be in equilibrio between two external ſorees, they are æqual and opposite, and ſhe line joining the points of their application colncides with the line of direction in which thẽ ſorces are exerted. Suppose the point oſ a hody Plate IV. fig. 8. to be urged by a force whose intensity and direction is representęd hy a A; whilè the point b is urget by a ſorce whose intensity is represented hy b B, equal to a A; and whose direction is opposite to a A; s that bB either colncides with u A or is parallel to it. It is plain that those two forces woulil ror I. x be in equilibrio iſ applied to one point, because they are equal and oppositee But the hody will not be in equilibrio, unless the line a b between the points of application coincide with the produetion of Aa or Bb. For, when these two forces act, the point a is urged in the direction a A. But it is withheld by the corpuscular ſorces exerted between a and b, acting in the direction a . Thereſore the point a, being urged both in the direction a A and in the direction a b, tends to move in some intermediate direction a C. For the same reason, the point b will move in some intermediate direction  E. The hody will therefore change its positionn. That is, it is not in equilibrio. But iſ, as in fig. . the lines Aa, a b, bB, form one straight line, it is evident that there will be no such motion of the points a and 5 For a, being urged in the direction a A, and withheld in the opposite direction a b, and the force urging it in the direction a b being equal to that urging it in the direction a A, the point a is in equilibrio. In the same manner, b is in equilibrioo. The body will therefore be in perſect equilibrio between these two ſorees. It is easy to see that in the first case, where the body was not in equilibrio, the motions of a and b tend to diminish the inclination oſ the line a b to the direction oſ the ſorces, and would soon bring it into that direction, and then the body would be in equilibrio between them. Thus then it is one condition for the equilibrium of two forces, that their line oſ direction shall coincide with the line joining the points to which they are applied. Wheh this obtains, it is indifferent to what point of this line they are applied. The force ? B may be applied at b, or e, or f, &c. This is an important circumstance. 3d. When a body is in equilibrio between three forces, then S17. (a) The directions oſ these three ſorces lie in one plane. For this condition is necessary ſor their equilibrium if applied to one point. See DyNanics. l 318. (b) Thè intensities of these ſorces are proportional to the sides of a triangle or parallelogram which have the same direction. For this also is necessary ſor their equilibrium in one point. 319: (c) If three forces are set in equilibrio by being applied to three Hiſſerent points oſ a rigid body, all their Adirections meet in one point; or they are all parallel; and any one of the forces is to any other oſ them reciprocally as the perpendiculars drawn to their directions ſrom the point to which the remaining third external force is applied. Let the three ſorces, ncting in the directions AD, BE, CF, fſig. 4. be applied. to the points A, B, and C, of a rigid body. Let their intensities be represented by the length of these liness. Then it is to be proved that these direetions either meet in one point T, or that they are paralle. Also, iſ CG and CH be perpendicular to AD and BE, we shall have AD: BE æ CH: CG: ' If the directions AD and BE are not parallel, let them meet in T. Join CT, and draw C. parallel to AD, and C à to BE. Sincè we suppose these forces in equilibrio by the intervention of the rigid body, they are such as would halance iſ applied to one point with the same ũirections and intensities. Now the directions Cæ and C ⸗ are the same with AD and BE, and the ſigure CæT à is a parallelogram, and the forces AD and BE are in the same proportion as the sides Cæ and C 4 and the third CF is as CT, and has that direction, because a force equal and opposite to CT would, if applied at C, balance the forces C. and C. Thereſore the direction oſ the foree applied at C passes through the intersection T oſ the other two directions. Hence the first part oſ the proposition is demonstrated. Secondly, by reuson of the parallels C. and AT, and the parallels C o and BT, the angies C⸗ G and C. H are equal. So are the right angles at G and H. Thereſore the triangles C” G and C H are similar, and C⸗: C 9 CH: CG. But Cæ: Cę æAD: BE. Thereſore we have AD: BE æ CH: CG. Such ĩs the prooſ that may be deduced from a general proposition in dynamies. But it will greatly conduce to a better conception oſ the equilibrium in this fundamental case, if we trace the operation of the corpuseular connecting forces by which this equilibrium is immediately effected. 320. It is evident that by the joint action oſ the two forces acting in the directions AD and BE, anũ that oſ CF acting in the opposite direction to their equivalent, the point C is drawn away from the line AB. The body ĩs on the streteh hbetween C and the line AB, but between A and B there is a degree of compression. This state oſ things very much resembles what it would be iſ CA and CB were two threads, connecting C with A and with B, and having a slender rod or wire AB to keep those two points asunder. It is quite plain that if the body were pulled at C by a thread CF, and at A by a thread AT, and at B by the thread BT, those threads would have the directions oſ the ſorces Now this could not be unless there were some solid matter between A and B, keeping the threads asunder. The threads CA, CB, are stretched, and the rod AB is compressedl. We may perhaps conceive the internal mechanism still better i we suppose each oſf the lines CA, CB, and AB, to be spiral wires, twisted like cork-serewss When the forces pull at this elastic triangle, it is evident that the spirals CA and CB ill be stretched a little beyond their natural dimensions, and are therefore exerting contractile forces. But AB is compressèd into smaller bulk, and is thereſore exerting expansive or protrusive ſorces. Instead oſ thus pulling A, B, and C, in the directions AD, BE, and CF, we may suppose them pushed in the opposite directions DA, EB, and FC. In this case vo should find CA and CB in a state of compression, and AB on the stretch. It may even happen that all the three lines are stretched, or all three compressed. This happens when the direction DA or EB divides the interior angle oſ the trianglee. We always have one direction, such as CF, which does 50. Thæ other two directicns AD and BE either (as in this figure) both divide the external angles CAK and CBN, or both divide the internal angles. A little attentive consideration will make this very evident, but it requires many words. A ſorce cannot be immediately balanced except by an equal and opposite ſorce applied to the same point. The ſoree CF does not immediately balance the ſorces AD and BE, but an equal and opposite force CR.. This ſorce CR arises ſrom the combined action oſ the contractile forces oſ the threads CA and CB. It is their equivalent or resulting foree. CR is thereſore the diagonal oſ some purallelogram CPRQ, of which the side CP is to the side CQ as the contractile foree excited along CB. In like manner, the force AD is in immediate equilibrium with the contractile force of CA, and the protrusive or expansive force of AB. The force AL must be the diagonal of some parallelogram, whose sides have the direetions AC and BA, that is, of the parallelogram AKLI; and, lastly, BE is immediately halanced by its equal and opposite BO, the diagonal oſ the porallelogram BNOM, of which one side BM is the contractile force of CB, and the other BN is the protrusive ſorce oſ AB. Now, since every action is accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction, it ſollows that AI æ CP, and BM æ CQ, and AKæ BN. 821. Draw CS perpendicular to AB. Then, because in any triangle, the sides are as the sines of the opposite angles, ve have AL: LIæ sin. AIL: sin. LAI, æ sin. CAB: sin. CAG. But, making CA the radius, it is plain that CS is the sine oſ the angle CAB, and CũG is the sine of the angle CAG. Therefore we have AL: LI æCS: CG and also MO, or LI BO=CH: CS thereſore AL: BOæCH: CG consequently AD: BE =CH: CG Q E. à. Thus have we demonstrated the proportion between the forces applied at A and B. We should have the same determination for the ratio AD: CF, or of BE: CF, hy the same mode oſ procedure. It remains to demonstrate, by tracing the operation oſ the excited corpuscular forces, that the three lines FC, AD, and BE, interseet in one point T. Thereſore draw P a and Q b parallel to AB, meeting Cæ in a, and C⸗ in b, and join a R and  R. The figure Ca Rb is a parallelogram. For, since CP and CQ are respectively equal to AI and BM, the triangles LKA and CP a are similar |and equal. So are the triangles P a R and MOB. So a|are CQb and ONB; and so0 are Qb R and ILA. Therefore Ca and b R being, each oſ them, equal and parallel to LA, are equal and parallel, and therefore Cb and a R are also equal and parallel, and the figure Cę RD is a parallelogram. Thus we see that CR is not only the diagonal oſ the parallelogram CQRP, and the equivalent of the two con. tractile forces CP and CQ, excited in the solid matter of the body, but that it is also the diagonal of the parallelogram Ca Rb, and the equivalent of the forces Ca and C b, which are parallel and equal to LA and OB, or to AD and BE, the external ſorcess. We seeo that although it is not in immediate equilibrium with those two ſorces, it would be in equilibrio with them, were they applied at . Moreover, since we know that AD: BE æ Cæ: C⸗ we have C a: Cb =Caæ: C 3, and thereſore the two similar parallelograms Co Rb and C T à are about the same diameter; that is, the direction CR, or FC, coincides with CT, that is, it passes through the intersection oſ the directions AD and BE. The force CF remotely halances the ſorces AD and BE, by exciting the contractile ſorees AI and BM, or CP and CQ, the equivalent oſ which, viæ. CR, it balances immediately, while the expansive ſorces AK and BN halance one another. The illustration by means oſ the threads CA and CB and the rod AB, by which the threads are kept apart, ĩs quite acourate, and gives us very just and adequate notions oſ the unperceived corpuseular action by which the ostensible balance is eſſected. It must also be noted, that the demons tration would have been precisely the same, to whatever points oſ the lines AT and BT the same ſorces had been applied in the same direetions. Even at the point T or beyond it, the three ſorces would still have balanced each other. We shall always have the same equality and reciprocity of ſorces between the connected points; and this will always give the same form to the parallelogram Cæ T s The form oſ the triangle ABC is altogether indiſſerent. This confirms, in an unquestionable manner, what was aſfirmed in dynamics, and is assumed by Sir Isaac Newton in his second Corollary ſfrom the Laws oſ Motion. Some mathematicians say that he has done this without sufficient æuthority, and that it should not have been assumed, but demonstrated. This is done here, on the authority of the third law of motionn. Nothing else has heen assumed. 322. It is scarcely necessary to repeat this discussion fsor the case where the two forces AD and BE do not inLerseet, being paralle. For it is evident that, in this case, the third ſoroę CF must be parsllel to the other two, and must bo ęqual to this sum, or to their diſſerence, aecording as the forcos AD 5nd BE act in the same or in opposite directions For this must he the case when all act on one point. Then, as to the proportion oſ AD o BE, the investigation is precisely the same vith the foregoing, there will be the same excitement oſ contraetile ſorcęs AT and BM, and of expansive ſorees AK and BN, and the same ultimate analogy AL: BOæ CH: CG, There is however a peculiar simplicity in this ease oſ purallel foroes, which is very oonveniont on numberſess occasions ; ſor whieh reason it is generally advisable to reduge all other eases to this, by resolving each ſorce into others, parallel to cœrtain lines properly chosen. The simplicity arises from this circumsiance, that the lines CH ant CG make one straight line, as in fig. 5. And, because CF is also parallel, it ſollows that the ſorees at A and B are inversely as the portions of any line PCq, or ARV, or BXT, intercepted between the parallel. That is, AD: BE æ CH: Cũ,  CQ: CP,  RV: RA, XEB: XT. In like manner AD: CF æBX: BT, æ QC: QP, &o. &e. 328. Also AD: BE  BX: AR, by drawing perpendiculars, not from C on the direetions AD and BE, but from A and B on the direction FC. Thia is peeuliarly convenient on many ocensions. 324. We nov see that it is not enough ſor insuring the equilibrium of three external forces, by the intervention of a solid hody, that they have such directions and proportions as vould make them halance when acting on one atom. Iſ the body he at perſeet liberty, this balance will be effected, but the body will generally move and assume a particular attitude, allow me so io eall it), such that the perpendiculars drawa from one of the points of application on the directions of the ſorees acting on the other two points, are reciprocally proportional to the intensities of those ſorces. In any other attitude oſ the hody, the ſorces are purtly employed in changing (as will appẽar by and by) the position or situation of the hody among other hodięs This remark, and this distinction between attitude and situation or position, will be ſound to he important. Qur chief concern at present is to obtain the proportions oſ the balancing ſorces; and even this was required, in order to learn the law which regulates the excitement of the corpuscular foreess Accordingly, we have learned the magnitude oſ the force exeited at B fig. 4 hy the application oſ the force AD at A The force excited at B is evidently BO, and ve discover this practically, by finding that AD is holanced by BE. We know that BO is equal, and opposite to this ſoree E. 8235. We cannot proceed much ſarther without taking some notice oſ the change oſ attitude oęcasioned by the notion of external ſorcess When things are in this state oſ equilihrium; auppose that some addition is made to the ſorce AD, ſig. 4. it will no longer halance AL, and the point A must ho urgei and must move towards T The point B also nill shiſt ils placee The ſorea CF must also be supposed to receive some change, that it may again balance AD and BE. But we do not at present attend 30 particularly lo the condition oſ that point; and we may suppose it retained in its place by a competent force. The body must take a new attitude, as ve do not supposæ the directions of AB and BE to ghange, the mglo s Cæ, and the opposite angle T oſ the parallelogram retains its mognitude. But it will be diſferently divided by CT. For it may be remarked that CT being taken as radius, CII and CG- are the sines of the angles CTEB and CTA. Thereſore, as we supposed the ſorce AD to be augmented, BE remaining the same, the ratio of CH to CG must increasee Thereſore the angie CTA must diminish and CTB must increase; the line CT shiſting towards that side on which B is. Hence we see that increasing AD tends to give the body a 30rt oſ rotative motion round C in one direction; ænd that augmenting BE will tend to produce a rotative motion round C in the contrary directionn. In short, the body must again assume such an attitude, that the perpendieulars CH and CG are again proportional to the forces applied at A and B. 326. Since ve have AD: BE æ CH: CG, we have AD X CG æ BE x CH; that is, when the equilibrium obtains which ascertains the ratio oſ the excited ſorces, we have the rectangles or products oſ the ſorees hy their perpendicular distances ſrom C in the ratio oſ equality. This equation may he conceived as indicating an equality of energy or momentum ſor turning the body round the point C, ſor such rotation happens immediately, if either of the ſorces AD and BE be increased or diminished. This way of considering the subject, is not our chieſ object at present, but it will be useſul to keep it in mind. We may express it more brieſly by making a represent the perpendicular from e on the direction oſ the force applied at A, and b the perpendicular on the direction oſ the force applied at B. This gives the equivalent equation ADx a m BE x b. Till this be accomplished, we have no method of ascertaining the force exerted in the different partss We know however, (and it is of importance to have it ſamiliarly in our recolleetion) that while this body is changing its attitude, the force exerted in every particle, is precisely competent to the motion which is there produced. We have seen, that when a mass oſ rigid matter, or as it is usually denominated, a solid body, is the intermedium by which three forces are made to halance one another, their directions meet in one point. Hence it ſol- Iows that these directions are in one plane, namely, the plane oſ the triangle ABC. Three forces may have their directions meeting in one point, and yet may be in diſſerent planes, as when they meet in the vertex D of the tetrahedron ABCD of Plate III fig. 7. But in this case there is not an equilibrium, without the action of a ſourth force, as we shall see by and by. At present we proceed to investigate the exerted ſorces when more than three points are considered. It is necessary to begin with forces acting all in one plane. 327. Let the forees AD, BE, CF, S5, Ilate IV. fig. 6. be applied to the ſour poiuts A, B, C, S, all in one plane, in vwhich are also the lines oſ direction oſ the forces; and let all be in equilibrio. It is required to determine the ratio oſ the ſorces. Any one of the forces, BE ſor example, may be stated as in opposition to two other ſorces AD and Ss, tending to turn the hody round the point C to which the remaining foree CF is appliedl. BE may thereſore he considered as the aggregate oſ two forces, B æ and e E, oſ which the first hbalances AD, and the second halances Ss. The process oſ investigation may he the same as hefore. AL, equal and opposite to AD, is the fſorce exerted at A, and it arises ſrom a contractile force AI combined with a protrusive forcee AK. Making BN  AK, and drawing NO parallel to BC, we determine BO, the foree exerted at B by the action oſf AD at A In like manner, moking S  equal and opposite to S5, wve determine the exerted contractile force S ĩi, and protrusive force S E. Make B n  Sk, and no parallel to BC, we get the ſorce Bo exerted at B by the action of S5 at S. Thence we learn that a ſorce BE equal to the sum oſ BO, and B o will balance the forces at A and S, and thus obtain the ratio of the exerted ſorces. We also leurn the force at C by making CP and CQ equal to Al and BM respectively, and C p and Cq equal to 8ĩ and Bm. Then ſorming the purallelograms CPRQ and Cꝑ r q, and drawing the diagonals CR and Cr, and making them the sides oſ another parallelogram CRV?, we draw the diagonal CV. CV is the ſorce exerted at C by the action of the three ſorces at A, B, and S, and C, equal and opposite to CV, is the external ſorce Thus is the ratio of all the forces determined. All this is evident ſrom § 820, and the composition of forces. 328. Supposing perpendiculars ſfrom C on each of the lines AD, BE, and S5, and representing them by the symbols a, b, and s, it is plain that AD x a =BO Xb, and S 5 x 8 = B o x b, and thereſore BOA Bo x b, or BE XbADxX + S s x8. This equation may be considered as expressing the equality of the rotative momentum round C oſ the force BE to the combined momenta of AD and S6. If the two directions AD and S85 intersect in any point G, and if the ſorees are applied at that point, they will have the same rotative momentum as when applied at A and S8. For the perpendiculars ſrom C on their directions are not changed by changing the points in the lines oſ direction to which they are applied. Therefore, iſ instead of applying the forces AD and S: at G, we apply this equivalent G, the efſect should he the same also, since it is indiſſerent to what point in the line oſ its direction the ſorce be applied, this equivalent may he applied to any point oſ the line G  H. Nay, what is not 30 Obvious, if the forces AD and 5 are jointly applied to any point of this line, the equilibrium with BE xb will still obtain. For let ABDR fig. 7. be a parullelogram having BE for its diagonal. From any point C draw perpendiculars C d, Ca, and Cr, on the sides BD, BA, and the diagonal BR. draw CL parallel to DD, CEF parallel to DR, and CIH, EG, and DK porallel to BR, meeting the parallels CL, BD, and AR, in &, E, I, F, H. We have BR xX CrDBRHI BA x Co  BAFE,  BRGE DB x Cd æ LBDK but LB, orCI: IE =BR (or IH):: BD CI x BD æ IH x IE and LBDE æ EGHI therefore BAXCo+BDxdBRGE, +EGHI, =BRHI, =BRXCr. 329. The reader will doubtless pereeive, that iſ there be any number oſ points heyond C to which external forces are applied, the same process may be followed for ascertaining the portion oſf the whole force BEE which is in equilibrio with each oſ them. Thereſore, conversely, it ascertains the ſorce exerted in those different points by the action oſ an external force at B. We also may perceive that we can always reduce the forces in equilibrio with BE to one, by continuing their Airections till they intersect, and supposing their equivalent force applied at the point of intersection. Having done this, ve may suppose, instead oſ BE, any number oſ forces applied to points on the same side of C, and in equilibrio with the equivalent oſ all the ſorces applied on the other side. To do this in detail would be a tedious process But the reader must, I apprehend, see by Lhis time, that when the equilibrium obtains, ve shall have an equation expressing it, and containing, on one side, the sum oſ the products oſ each force tending to turn the body in one direction by the perpendicular ſrom C on the line oſ its direction; anũ on the other side an equal sum oſ similar produets ſor the ſorces which tend to turn the body in the contrary direction. Lastly, Since we saw that when there were only two ſorces AD and BE, fſig. 4. the direction oſ the force at C passed through the intersection T oſ AD and BE, or all wero parallel, and that, in either case CF was equal and opposite to the equivalent oſ AD and BE, it ſollows that we can always reduce the most complicated case to that of two equal and opposite forces. Hitherto the directions oſ all the ſorces, and also the points to which they are applied; have heen supposed to lie in one and the same plane. But a body may be at once impelled in numberless directions in different planes, and the points oſ application may have any situation on the surſace oſ the body. We must endeavour to simpliſy the consideration of this complicated case. This will he done by the help of the following proposition. 330. Let any number oſ external ſorces be applied to a solid body, in any points, and in any directions, and let all be in equilibrio. Let a plane pass through the point to which one of them is applied, and let all the ſorces be reduced to that plane, in the manner described under dynamics. Then I say that these reduced ſorces are such à would he in equilibrio were they applied to their respective points in that plane. Let A, B, C, (fig. 8.) be three points oſf a body to which external forces are applied. Let the point C be supposed to lie in the plane oſ the paper, but the points A and B to be ahove that plane, in the air. Suppose the forces AD and BE to have their directions in the plane oſ the triangle ABC, and construet a figure expressing the excited forces, in the same way as was done in 5 827. Let this ſigure be orthographically projected on the plane of the paper, by drawing perpendiculars Aq, Iĩ, KE, LI, &c. ſrom every angle to the paper. We shall then have its orthographic projection. The reader's imagination may he assisted by supposing the original figure to be made of wire, and to have its point C on the paper, but all the rest ahove the paper, except the line CF, which goes throngh to the under sidee Now let the paper be so held that the sun shines perpendicularly on it. The wire figure will cast a shadow on the paper, which will be its accurate orthographie projectionn. This is represented by ſainter lines. The triangle ACB has a Cb for its shadow. Iai is the shadow of the parallelogram LKAI Cprq is the shadow of CPRũQ, and Cſ is the projection of CF, heing the eontinuation oſ r C, which is the shadow oſf RC. Now since this projeetion is made by lines perpendicular to the paper, and thereſore parallel to one another, the plane Aa k  is parallel to the plane IVlL, and the plane A a ĩ l is parallel to the plane Kæl L (Eucl. xi. 15.) Thereſore the intersections Iĩ and a with the plane oſ the paper are parallel (Eucl. xi. 16.). So are the intersections a ĩ and  I. Thereſore leai is a purallelogram. So, in like manner, is m b n o. Also, because AK  BN, and the lines K, Aa, Bb, Nu, are parallel, we have l a =bn. Thereſore it is demonstrated, in the same way as in 5 326, that if perpendiculars C  and Ch are dravn from C on the directions a l and b o, we shall have a l x Cg=©bo x Ch, and the two ſorces la and o b (Which are the forces LA and OB reduced to this plane, and applied at æ and at b) are in equilibrio, or have equal rotative momenta round C. It is evident that we may proceed in the same way with any number oſ reduced forces that we have done with forces originally acting in the plane of the paper, by which means the proposition is demonstrated. There is no occasion to consider the forees which are perpendicular to this planee For the body being supposed in equilibrio, the ſorees are such as would be in equilibrio in any direction, iſ all were applied to one point. Therefore they would be in equilibrio iſ all were estimated in a direction perpendicular to this plane; and thereſore the sum of all the forces acting in one direction would he equal to that oſ the ſorces acting in the opposite direction, s0 that no motion will ensue ſrom those perpendiculur ſorces alonẽ. From this proposition may be deduced a corollary expressing a remarkable property of the centre oſ position. 331. If there he applied to every particle oſ a solid body an equal and parallel ſoree, and iſ a foree equal to their sum be applied in the opposite direction, in a line passing through the centre oſ position, all will be in equilibrio. The body will neither be moved out oſ its place, nor vill it change its attitude. Let P (fiz. 9.) be the centre oſ position of a solid body, and EGFH a section of the budy by a plane passing through the centre of position in a direction parallel to that of the ſorces. Buppose a force applied to a particle A in this plane, acting in the direction Aæ, and let A. also represent the intensity oſ this foree. Lot the line FE, paraſiel to Aæ, pass through P. Then this line may rpresent the section oſ the plane EGFH by another plane perpendicular to it. In like manner, let the other partieles B, C, D, &e. in the plane EGFH be actuated by forces B⸗, C,, D), &e. all equal and parallel to A.. Let the same be supposed oſ every other particle of the hody, both those that are above the plane EGFH oſ the figure and that below it. From every purticle let perpendiculars Aa, Bb, Co, D, &. be drawn to the plane which outæ the plane EGFH in the line EF perpendicularly. Now, Iet all the forcos Aæ, B 8, &. with their perpendiculars Aò, Bb, &e. be orthographically projected on the plane EGFH, in the manner deseribed in the last proposition. The slightest consideration will shew us that the projeetion or shadow of each line representing a foree must be a line equal and purallel to it, and thereſore equal and parallel to Aæ or Bę, &c. Also the perpendicular drawn ſrom the particle to the upstanding plane is precisely equnl to its projection, whieh is also perpendicular to EF. Thereſore the sum oſ all, or of any parcel oſ the perpendiculars to the upstanding plane, is equal to the sum oſ all the corresponding projections, perpendicular to EF. Now, because all the forces are parallel, and their sum is equal to the force applied to some point in the line FE, in the direction FE, they would balance if applied all to the same point. Thereſore the hody will not he moved out oſ its placee Moreover, since, by the property of the centre oſ position, the sum oſ all the perpendieulars on one side of FE is equal to the sum oſ all those on the other side, and the forces are all equal; it follows that the sum of all the produets oſ the ſorees by their perpendioular distances ſrom the line FE on one side, is equal to the sum oſ similar products on the other side. Their rotative momenta are thereſore equal, or they balance each other, and the body has no tendency to change its attitude. All motion is thereſore stopped, whether progressive or rotative. Note, that the complete equilibrium requires that the line oſ direction of the single opposing ſoroe pass through the very centre oſ position, because it is then only that we shall have the equality oſ the sums of the perpendieulars on the two sides oſ every plane that ean be dravn through that line of direction. Should the line of diretion be fe, fig. O. although still inæ plane passing through V, the rotative momentum on the side e H f will exceed that on the side e G f, and the hody will tura in the direetion eH f It is an ohvious inſerence ſfrom this proposition, that iſ a heavy body be supported hy a single point in the vertical line passing through its centre oſ position; then, Imo, The foree which thus supports the hody acts directly upwards, and is equal to the aggregate or sum of the weight oſ all the particles; and 2do; The body will have no i. deney to loan towards any side. Vor the hody may be eonesived as having every partiVOL. I. cle actuated hy an equal ſorce, acting in parallel lines. Thereſore, by this proposition, all are halanced, any plane being made to pass through the vertical line oſ support, the rotative momenta on the opposite sides oſ this plane are equal, by this proposition, and thereſore the body will incline to neither side, but will remain in the same attitude, just as iſ the weight oſ every particle were united in the centre oſ position. For this reason the point, determined in the way already described, and which we have called the centre of position, has been called the cENTRE OF GRAVITY, meaning by the term the point in which the whole gravity oſ the body is usually supposed to be coneentratedl. This however is an inaccurate conceptionn. The weight oſ all the particles is not applied to the centre oſ gravity, nor does it act there by itsell. But such must be the distance of the particles of the whole system, that a certain foree may be mutually exerted hy the support and the physically touching particle oſ the system, equal to the sum of the parallel and equal actions of gravity on the particles. It is not the gravity oſ the body whieh acts on the support, but a corpuscular repelling ſforcee And it is really the centre of gravity, if we suppose the gravity oſ all the particles perſectly equal, and all acting in parallel liness. But it would not he the centre oſ the efſort oſ gravity oſ a body placed very near to the centre of the earth, because, in that situation, the gravities oſ the diſferent particles will neither be equal nor paralle. The name is, however, proper enough in respect oſ any body oſ moderate bulk on the surface of this globe. 382. Such are the more simple and elementary laws by which the excitement oſ corpuscular force is regulated. They may also be ealled the laws oſ the propagation oſ pressuree. This is a very usual but inaccurate manner of expressing the phenomenon. It is very true that when the conditions here enumerated are observed, a pressure being exerted on one point oſ a solid hody, iĩt is instantly accompanied by a determinate pressure, exerted by some other part oſ the hòdy, balancing some other external pressure But we have full evidence, by what was said in 5 820, that the pressure that is observed in the remote part is the excitement oſ a corpuscular force belonging to that part, by means of an unknown number oſ eorpuscular forees which connect the intervening particles oſ the hody. Wahen these intermediate ſorces are wanting in any part, the remote pressure does not appear. We shall find, once we hegin the consideration oſ the forces actually existing, that these laws ãre ãs accurate as any theorem in geometry, confirming, in the most unexceptionable manner, the justness oſ the three propositions which we called the laws oſ motion, and the propriety of the mark and measure which we adopted of every change. It is now time to consider the motions producible in a mass of solid matter by the action of an external force. VWe shall find this to be a subject considerably different ſrom the motions in physical astronomy. In the celestial motions, the ſoree which produces the change oſ motion is conceived as acting alike, or nearly alike, on every particle of the body, and acting without any intermedium. Every particle was conceived as inſluenced by a force corresponding with its situation, without any dependence on the state oſ the other particless Jupiter and Mereury, if in the same place, would be equally moved, although Jupiter contains 5000 times as much matter as Mercury. A certain variation oſ velocity is acquired in that place, by every body; and the magnitude or quantity of this variation, can he varied only by a change of situationn. But here, the external force is commonly applied to some part oſ the body, and the parts at a distance are moved, not by the external force, but by the corpuscular forces exeited between the particless. This excitement requires the expenditure oſ the ſorce employed, in order to generate any particular velocity in the whole mass, and the expenditure must be so much the greater, as the number of particles excited to motion is greaterr. The quantity oſ motion produced depends thereſore on the ſorce employed, and. the velocity generated depends also on the mass oſ the hody moved. Sir Isanc Newton saw the necessily oſf a distinction between the vis motrix, or moving force, and the vis acceleratrin, or accelerating ſorce. The first is measured hy the quantity oſ motion produced or changed by it, and the. last by the velocity generated. The first ohservation oſ moment on this way oſ producing motion is, that iſ an external foree act on a slid body, in a line passing through its centre oſ position or gravity, it will produce a motion of the wholæ body, in its own direction, every particle advancing alike, and. thereſore without any rotation or ?change of aititude. 333: Let ꝑ express the magnitude oſ the moring ſorce; and m the number of particles in the body to be moved by it. It is plain, hy the last proposition, that if a force E or the m*. part oſ ꝑ, be applied to each particle, in the opposite direction, all will be in equilibrio. Now suppose the ſoree  to be annihilated in an instant. It is plain that the body will immediately begin to move in the direction opposite to that oſ the ſoree ꝓ, and that overy particle will move alike, being each impelled by an equal force _ just as a heavy body falls without changing its attitude, all parts being equally acted on. By the continued action oſ the ſorce H on every particle during some given time, a second ſor example, every particle acquires the velocity o in the same direction The whole quantity of motion, therefore, will be m v, the exact measure oſ the ſorce » which held the body in equiSuppose, on the other hand, that all the ſorces Ei are annihilated in an instant, while  is pressing the body in its proper direction. Every purticle is pressed in this direetion with the ſorce £; ſor all was in equilibrio when the external ſorces were applied to each particlee. Each was thereſore opposed to an equal and opposite ſoree E These ſorces, excited by the ſoree ꝑ, must now act alone, and will produce the same motion, but in the opposite direction, that was produced by the external ſorees H when the force 2 was removed. That is, by the action oſ those equal excited ſorces, every particle will begin to move in the direction oſ the ſoreœ ꝑ, and will acquire the velocity 0, if ꝓ continue to act on that body during a second, and the whole quantity of motion will be m v, the proper measure oſ the ſorce ꝓ. The ſorces actually exerted in the diſferent particles are not, strietly speaking, all equal; ſor, on the contrary, the force exerted in the particle to which 2 is immedintely applied, is equal to the whole foree 2. But by ſar the greatest part oſ the force exerted in ĩt is employed in pressing the particles with which it is immediately coherent, suſficiently near to the particles beyond them for exerting the necessary ſorces in them, to be expended in like manner in pressing those still more remote; and there remains only a portion z sufficient for giving this particle the velocity . This will appear very distinetly, by considering hackwards ſrom the most remote series oſ purticles. These reeeive only as much pressure as suſſices for giving them this velocity, and they react a much on the penult series. The particles oſ this series receive, each oſ them, a pressure sufficient ſor balancing this reaction, and a pressure suſficient for giving them the velocity  Thus each series in suceession sustains more pressure as it is nearer lo the particle acted on ly the ſorce 7. But in every particle there is an overplus of force sufficient for producing the velocity . There is no mystery or intricacy in thiss For it is this overplus alone that was the balance ſor the ſorces : that wve at first supposed to be applied to each particle, and to be all haIanced by the ſorce p. There was, in that case, the sume serieses oſ ſorces, greater and greater as we approach the oint to which  is applied; but these are all employed in connecting the particles, and keeping them in that state oſ strain that is necessary ſor the excitement of that ſorce in each particle which immediately balances the external ſorce applied Llo each. All these conneeting ſorces vanish, or cease Lo act, the instant that the force p is annihilated, and the body moves with the velocity æ. For, in that instant, the strain being removed, the particles all resume their natural distances, in which they are inactive, and the body continues to move with the velocity already acquired. This indeed is not strictly true, because when the particles spring back to their natural distances, they commonly overpass them a little, as a pendulum let go ſrom an oblique position does not stop at its natural position in the vertical, but passes to the other side, and oscillates some time, till it is brought to rest by various obstruetionss. The particles oſ the impelled body do the same thing, and vibrate a little on each side oſ their natural places, till this ceases, by the imperſection of their elasticily That this is really the case, may be easily perceived by striking away a small bell or other elastic body. It may be heard ringing all the while it ſlies through the air. It may sometimes be more distinctly perceived in a childs plaything which imitates a mouse jumping out of a hox. Iſ this be so placed on the ſloor as that the mouse springs out along the ſloor, the spiral wire that is attached to it will sometimes be seen to expand and contract several times as it runs along the ſloor. The other circumstance to be observed in this motion is, that it is merely progressive, without any rotation, This must he the case, since every particle has the same velocity v, no one gains upon another, and thereſore, whatever position or bearing they Mave in the beginning, they retain it during the whole motionn. The same progressive motion, ſree ſfrom all rotation, will be produced i the equivalent oſ any number of forces be in a line which passes through the centre oſ position. For a force equal and opposite to this equivalent, and applied in a line also passing through the centre, will balance those forces. Let the intensity oſ this equivalent be , and let m be the number of particles in the body. Then if a force be applied to each particle, they will balance this equivalent, and be halanced by it. The effect, therefore, oſ the primitive external forces being equal, and opposite to the ſorce ꝓ, which balances their equivalent, and this being equivalent with a force equal and opposite to applied to each particle, the effect oſ the primitive external ſorces is to impress this force L on each particle, and thereſore it will cause the whole body to advance alike, without rotation. It is very obvious that this permanent attitude is peculiar to this case. For if the same ſorce, acting in the same direction, be applied in a line which passes on one side oſ the centre oſ position of the hody, it is evident that that side will advance, in the very beginning oſ the motion, ſaster than the other. The body will thereſore both advance and turn round. It is also obvious that this will hbe the most general result. For an sction in a line passing through the centre is but one of millions oſ casess. Accordingly, it is very rarely that progressive motion is not combined with a motion oſ rotation. In the great movements oſ Nature, the celestial motions, ve see those two kinds of motion alWays conjoined. All the planets on which ohservations ean be made, turn round their axis while they revolve round the sun or other central hody. A stone thrown ſrom the hand, a bomb or cannon hall from the muæzle oſ the piece, are always observed to whir] as they fly. It requires particular contrivances to prevent this when inconvenient. On the other hand, this motion oſ rotation being subject to ſixed principles, we can modiſy it so as 10 suit any purpose ve may have in view. This will come under consideration by and by; and in the mean time we proceed with the remaining circumstances oſ progressive motion, as connected with the foree employed. 3385. The quantity of motion produced hy the action oſ a force was taken ſor the measure of that moving ſoree, upon every ground of good argument. (See Dv ams.) Iſ any ſorce he necessary for giving a certain motion to a cubic foot of maiter, as much is surely necessary for giving the same motion to another cubic ſoot. Thereſore it is most reasonable to call that a double ſorce which gives the :ame motion to a double quantity oſ matter. The ohservations which have been made on the way in which force applied to one part of a ſirm body produces motion in the whole, perfectly agrees with this suggestion of common sense, and even confirms it, by shewing how those sensible pressures, which we call moving ſorces, arise sometimes ſrom the comhined action oſ accelerating ſorces, such as gravity and magnetism, whose action on each atom is insensiblee. The sensibhle pressure oſ a mass oſ lead, used as the moving ſorce acting on a machine, ĩs usually eonsiũered as the accumulated gravitation of every particlee But we have seen that, although it be equal to the sum of those gravitations, it is really the corpuscular repulsion, or something similar, of the touching parts oſ the machine and weight, exerted, or brought into action by the compression occasioned by the heaviness of each particle. And we have seen how this mutual action comes to be as precisely measured hy the number of particles oſmnother hody which it puts into motion, and the velocity generated in each, as the action oſ gravity on the weight ĩtselſ is so measured. In other cases of moving ſorces, such as that of a spring, it cannot be measured in any other vay. The sensible pressure oſ a spring is not the accumulateũ elastic foree exerted by every particle of the spring. These elastic forces are only exerted between the purticles oſ the spring; and they are probably not much inferior to the sensible pressure oſ the spring on the body moved by itt. The sum total of these is probably immense; but it is unknown to us. This moving ſorce cannot be measured in any olher way than by the motion produced by it. But although the force oſ a spring must not he considered as the sum of the elasticities of the purticles, it is still their combined actionn. The spring must unhend through some sensible space, thãt it may Tollow the yielding body, continually accelerating it, till the velocity becomes sensible This could not be effected by the elasticity oſ the touching paris alone; their utmost mòtion is not the millionth of the millionth part oſ an inch, and would he instantly at an end by the yielding oſ the body. But each purticle moving a little, the end of the spring is urged over a sensible space, and produces its efſfect. We have a clear evidence oſ this internal motion oſ compressionn.  we strike off any sonorous body, such us a metal plate, or a bell, by a smart hlow, we shall hear it ringing all the while ĩt ſlies through thè nir. Its particles were compressed in succession, till the whole was put into motion, and quitted the body which impelled it, and then, springing back to their natural distances ſrom each oſther, they overpassed them, as a pendulum let go ſrom an oblique position passes the vertical line which is its natural quiescent position. Just s0 the particles vibrate for a while on each side oſ their natural positions, till this motion is extinguished by their imperſect elasticity. 336. Thus it appears that the force oſ a spring, by which it can put other hodies in sensible motion, is not the sum, nor equal to the sum oſ the elastic forces exerted by each of its particles, although the joint action oſ them all is necessary ſor the ostensible efſfect. It is only in such cases as gravity, magnetism, and others which we call attractions or repulsions, that the ostensible effect is at least equal to the sum of the forces acting on each particlee. Both kinds oſ moving ſorees are measurable by the motions which they produce. And it may be observed here, that the perſect agreement between the measure of gravitation by considering the weight or pressure oſ a heavy body as the sum, or at least as equal to it, of the gravitation oſ each particle, and by the motion which this weight will produce in another body, is a prooſ oſ the propriety oſ the Cartesian measure oſ the ſforce of moving bodies Were we to suppose this ſorce proportional to the square of the velocity produced, we should be led into numberless paralogisms, as any one will perceive by the example already given oſ the hody dragged along a horizontal plane by another hanging by a cord. If we measure the ſorce by its action in equal times, and this action by the quantity of motion generated, we shall find it always the same, as we have every reason to think that it iss. The weight oſ the hanging body is the sole moving power, and it is always the same, When it is employed to give motion to twice, or thrice, or ſour times as much matter, including its own, it generates 3, j, or; of the velocity, and always produces the same quantity of motion. But iſ we measure the foree by the square oſ the velocity, the action diminishes. in the same proportion that we increase the quantity of matter. The values oſ the generated velocities may also be considered as the accelerative powers oſ the forces, in the circumstances oſ their employment. The powers themselves are generally known to us as pressures, or as solicitations to motion, and must he previously known, otherwise we cannot use them as terms oſ any proportion. They must be estimated by some measure oſ the same kind. We can compare the moving force of a how with the action oſ gravity, by observing what weight will draw the bow to a given height, and compare this weight with the weight oſ the arrow. In the same way we can compare the attraction of a magnet with the ſorce oſ a stream oſ wind, by balancing both by weights, and comparing the weightss But we cannot compare the impulsion oſ a moving body with any thing but another impulsion. By attempts to compare impulsion with pressures oſ any kind, mechanicians have been led inlo many puzæling difſiculties. The comparison mentioned above, of the attraction oſ a magnet with the force of wind, may be thought contrary to this assertionn. But we shall see that vwhat we experience as the force oſ a stream oſf wind or water, is not an impulse but a pressure, accurately comparable with other pressures. 337. It only remains ſarther to be noticed, that in the preceding observations on the action of ſorces, we always mean to speak of the ahsolute pressure, energy, or strain really acting on the body. It is ſfrequently necessary to distinguish this ſrom the whole ſorce residing in, or somehow attending the substance employed as the vehicle oſ the power. Thus, in the example already alluded to on several occasions, the whole gravitation of the hanging body seems to be employed in dragging the equal body along the table But the thread is only stretched by half oſ its weight. For it still descends with halſ oſ its natural velocity, and it only generates this half velocity in the other body. If there he any difficulty in conceiving this, it will become clear by comparing it with n case precisely similar, but which we conceive differently. A magnet attracts a pennyweight oſ iron, and in a minute generates in it a certain velocityn. Add another pennyweight of iron, and the piece oſ twice the weight and bulk will acquire the same velocity, just as a piece of two pounds weight ſalls as fast as a piece of one pound. But join to the pennyweight of iron a pennyweight oſ brass, and the magnet will generate but half of the velocity. Here the same tendency of the iron toward the magnet has to drag along with it a mass which is without any tendency toward the magnet, just as the heavy body has to drag along the table a body which has its tendency downward taken awvay by the table. We must, in every employment oſ the natural moving ſorces, deduct ſfrom the whole ſoree competent to the subject employed, the part which is expended in making that subject ſollow up the yielding body so as to continue its action on it. This deduction is ſrequently of difficult investigation, purticularly when we employ the strength oſ animals. The proportion of their foree which is thus expended, varies with the velocity with which they must move, in order to continue their actionn. A certain velocity disables the animal from accelerating the body any more, hecause it requires all its strength to continue this velocity oſ its own body. This subject will be particularly considered, when we are occupied with the performance of machines. 338. We will now inquire into the modifications oſ tho motion produced by the action of an external force, when the direction of the ſorce does not pass the centre oſ gravity. Since, in this case, an equal accelerating ſorce is not exerted in every particle; they will not move alike, some vill move ſaster than otherss As the body is supposed to retain its continuity and its force, this unequal motion oſ its different parts must constitute a sort of rotation by which the body will change its attitule What in the beginning was the uppermost, or ſhe foremost, or the nethermost, will not continue so. It remains therefore to he considered, whether this motion of rotation he regulated by steady principles, and what is the relation subsisting between it and the progressive motions which have hitherto engaged all our attention, of what modiſications it is susceptible, and how we may be able to direct or modiſy it. This is not a matter oſ mere curiosity. The noblest mechanical art practised by man, depends entirely on those modiſications; I mean the art oſ working a ship. A ship must be considered as a body at perſeet liberty to move in oveory direction, and is susceptible oſ an inſinite variety oſ motions hesides the motion of progression, by which she advances in her course. She heels to leeward by pressure of the wind on her sails. She rolls and pitches by reason oſ the continual shiſling oſf her support by the waves. Shæ is made to yaw fſrom her course by various buſetings which the diſſerent parts oſ the hull receive ſrom the seas She receives various motions, round various axes, aceording as the sails are spread or trimmed, and according as her bows strike the water during her progressive motionn. All these tendeneies to conversion, are not only useless but hurtſul, and must be opposed by other ſorces, exerted by the rudder, in which oſfice a part oſ ita directing power is expended, so that the remainder is ſrequently almost unable to produce the conversion alnlutely necemsary ſor the saſety oſ the ship. Thus, in a in some enses extremely rapid, the progressive motion is the same as when the ſorce aets in a line passing through the centre oſ gravity and produces no rotation. It was demonstrated in dynamics, that iſ any body D, of a collection or system A, B, D, be moved uniſormly in a straight line, the centre of gravity moves uniſormly in the same direction, and that its velocity is to that of the body D as the matter in that body is to the whole matter of the systemThereſore, iſ this motion has heen the effect of any foree, the motion of the centre is aſſected in the same manner as iſ this ſorcœ had acted in the same direetion on all the matter oſ the system collected in that eentre. And, since this is equally true with respeet to each body of the sy⸗tem, it follows that if each hody be moving in any manner, by the action oſ difſerent ſorces, the motion oſ the centre is the sume as iſ all those ſorces were applied Lo the whole matter oſ the system collected there. Hence it ſollowed, that if equal and opposite ſorces act on any two hodies, or on every puir oſ hodies of the system, the motion oſ the centre is not afſected by those equal and opposite forces, because the equal and opposite motions resulting ſrom this action compensate one another. Therefore, iſ a system oſ hodies are moving in such a manner that they cannot continue their motions without disturbing one another, either by collision, or because they are joined to one another by rods or strings, this disturbance consists in mutual action, each oſ which is accompaniei by an equal reaction in the opposite direetion. Such a system must thereſore be considered as acted on by equal and opposite ſorces; and the motion oſ the centre is the same as iſ they did not act on one another at all. Iſ the centre was at rest while their motions were not disturbed by one another, itt will continue at rest notwithstanding the disturhance or total change oſ the individual motions, and if it was in motion, it will continue moving in the same direction, and with the same velocity as heſore. 340. Now any solid or cohering body is such a system, consisting oſ parts, which are so connected by material interpositions, that one part cannot move in any direction whatever, without either dragging the adjoining points along with it, or pushing them beſore it, or turning them aside, in one way or another; and these actions oſ the parts or particles oſ the body are all mutual, equal, and opposite. In whatever manner the particle a affects any remote particle , the particle p affects a in a way precisely equal and oppositee Therefore, whatever motions may be oceasioned to the different parts oſ this body by their mutual connection, the motion of the body, produced by the action oſ any external force or ſorces, is not affected hy them, it being estimated and measured by the motion of the centre We have seen that when a ſorce ꝓ acts on a body containing the quantity oſ matter, or number oſ particles, in a direction passing through the centre oſ the body, it causes the whole body to advance with the velocity u, generating the quantity oſ motion m » =p. Every purtiele is aſſected by the accelerating ſoree and advances with the velocity æ. Nov let the same ſoree  = mv act on the same hody, hut in a direction which does not pass through the centre. The body will both advance and turn round; some parts will be moving faster than others, and in other directions, and some may even be moving hackwardss. But the motion of the centre of gravity will he the same as in the last case, it will move in the same direction, and its velocity vill be æ as beſore. It is plain that the centre oſ gravity will still deseribe a straight line, but that the other parts oſ the hody must be moving in curve lines, oſ various curvature, according to their position respecting the centre, just as we observe in a coach wheel rolling along a smooth roadc The centre oſ the wheel describes a line parallel to the road; but the voL. I. z other parts are sometimes above the centre and sometimes below it, sometimes heſore it and sometimes behind. We must now endeavour to ascertain this motion oſ rotation, shewing, Ist, The position of the axis round which this rotation is performed; and dly, The velocity of this rotation, or the relation subsisting between it and the motion of progression. For this purpose, we shall begin with a case of such simplicity that we shall be assisted in our first notions oſ the subject by the ordinary suggestions oſ common sense. 341. Let A and B (Plate IV. fig. I0.) be two equal balls, connected by an inſlexible line, of which G is the middle point, and consequently the centre of gravity oſ the system. Let AB be so divided in P that AP: PBQ2: I. Now suppose that a force acts on this system at the point G, at right angles to AB, and let its intensity be such that in a given moment oſ time it would cause the system to describe the small space GI, perpendicular to AB. From what has been already said, it ſollows that the two balls will sustain equal impressions, and will thereſore move equally ſast; and that at the end oſ the movement, the system will have the position ab parallel to AB. But let us now suppose that the same ſorce has acted on the system in the point P, and still in the same direction, perpendicular to AB. We have just now learned that the motion oſ the centre G will he the same as in the ſormer ease. Tt will still he at I at the end oſ the moment, and will continue to move uniſormly forward in that direction GI. But, in order to ascertain the place oſ the two halls at the end oſ the moment, ve must know their motions. And we must learn this by means oſ our Enowledge of the forces or pressures by which they are urged forvard. We learn this by inquiring what ſorces, applied to A and B in the opposite direction, will prevent them from acquiring this motion, that is, will just balance the force applied at P. Now we have seen that these ſorces must be in the inverse proportion of the distances of P ſrom the balls Thereſore the force or pressure which urges B into motion is double of that which acts on A, and thereſore will produce a double motion. The incipient motion of B will be double of that of A, and, at the end of the moment, the balls will be in such positions that B⸗ is double of Aæ. Therefore the line ææ is no longer parallel to AB, but cuts ĩt in C, so that BC is double of AC. But the centre G having moved over the same space GI as in the former ease, it is plain that the line à - must cut the position b a of the former case in the point I. Thus we see that the system AB has changed its attitude as well as its situation, and that this change oſ attitude is the beginning oſ a rotation round the point G, which point alone moves uniſormly in a straight line in the direction oſ the moving forcee This rotation commences round an axis which passes through the centre of gravity G, perpendicular to the plane of the figue. For the motions oſ the two halls being parallel to the direction FP of the moving ſorce, and to the line GI deseribed by the centre, are necessarily in the same plane with those lines and the line AB. Since they are motions oſ rotation round an axis, each hall describing the circumference of a cirele round it, this axis must he ſerpendicular to the planes of those cireles. 342. Let us now consider the momentary rotation, and its relation to the motion oſ progression. Suppose the line BC to be eonnected with the balls, and to be turning along with them. Since the motion of the balls has been such that the line BC is not, at the end of the moment, in the position b Ie, parallel to BC, but is inclined backwards so as to eut its ſormer position in the point C, ĩt appears that the point e has heen moving backwards while G was advancing along GI. Iſ about the centre I, with the radius Ic, we describe a small arch hackwards, it will sensibly coincide with the line c C which is parallel to IG. The situation oſ the extremity oſ the revolving line, instead oſ being in c will be (as to all sense) in C, so that the line itselſ, instead oſ seeming to have turned round G, seems rather to have turned round C. For the upper end oſ it is still in the same placee. This is actually observed in many instances. I a ſlat ruler, such as a gunters scale, lying on a table, be struck laterally with a small blow, at a point about à ds or  ths oſ its length, it will turn in this very way, one end remaining stil. But, to return to the two balls, we see in this momentary motion the beginning oſ a rotation, such that while G advances a small space GI, C describes (backwards) an arch oſ a circle equal to GI. Suppose this arch to be one degree. Then it will go completely round while G moves over a line 360 times greater than GI. We may thereſore state the relation oſ the rotative and progressive motions by saying, that the system makes one revolution while the centre describes a line equal to the circumſerence oſ a cirele whose radius is GC. Having examplified this combination of motions by this very simple and palpable case, we shall now consider the subject more generally. But, that we may avoid some part of that complication oſ action which renders the consideration oſ the sulject very intricate, we must still limit our attention to certain forms. We have seen that by applying the ſorce at P below the centre of gravity, the system of two balls gets an incipient rotation round the point C ahove or beyond the centre. In like manner, had it been applied to the right hand of the centre, it would have produced a rotation round some point on the leſt hand oſ itt. We thereſore confine our attention at present to such shapes of body as have a middle plane, dividing the hody through the centre, and having the matter similarly disposed on both sides. Such are all the solids formed by the revolution of a plane figure round an axis. Such are all the regular solids, all prismatic bodies, and a great variety of others We shall ſarther suppose that the impelling force acts in this dividing plane. Thus ve avoid any chance of rotation round an axis on either side of this plane. Even with this limitation, we shall have the same internal mechanism as in the cases that are excepted, and shall see that those exceptions make no diſſerence in the general results Since the eſſect oſ a ſorce applied to a solid body in a line passing through its centre oſ gravity, is to impress on every particle an equal accelerating ſorce in its own direction, and since it was also demonstrated that such equal end parallel forces did not aſſect the relative motions and actions oſ bodies, it follows that this force, so applied, will make no change in any motion oſ rotation that the body may already have. Now, let a solid body, oſ the class which has been selected for this introducetion, he acted on by a force in the direction FP (Plate IV. fig. 4.) in the plane which passes through the centre oſ gravity G, and divides the body in the manner already mentioned, but so that the direction FP does not pass through the centree Let ꝓ express the magnitude oſ the ſorce, or the quantity of motion which it would generate by acting uniſormly for some given moment oſ time, and let m express the number of equal particles, or the quantity oſ matter in the body. This ſorce will communieate to the centre of gravity G oſ this hody, the velocity 5 causing it to describe some line GI parallel to FI. Suppose that, at the same instant, an equal ſorce is applied to the centre, in the opposite direction. It is evident that all progressive motion of the centre is now preventedl. But it is as evident that there must be a rotation; for the two ſorces, though ęqual, are not directly opposed to each other. Now let a third ſorce, also equal to ꝓ, and acting in the same or a parallel direction, act on the centre oſ the body. This will cause the hody to move with the velocity L and will make no change in the rotation already produced. The body must (as I have said) move with the velocity r because now the body is in the same state as iſ neither ſorce had been applied at the centre, and as when the first ſorce » alone was applied at . But we made use oſ those ſorces in order to shew the certainty oſ the rotation, without making it difſerent ſrom what the force ꝓ alone will produce. Since the centre must advance in a straight line, it does not partake oſ the rotation. This must thereſore be perſormed round the centre, or round an axis pussing through the centre In order to find the position of this axis, we must recollect that the rotation is the same as when  was applied at F, and an opposing force was applied at the centre. In this case, the motion oſ the point F results ſrom the action oſ the ſorce in the direction FP, and that oſ the other ſorce at G, propagated in the direction GF. The incipient motion of F must thereſore be in the plane oſ these two ſorces, that is, the plane of NFG, that is, in a plane passing through the centre of gravity, in the direction oſ the moving force, and the axis round which the body turns is perpendicular to this plane. We shall see, in due time, why this is limited to the incipient motion, and what circumstances make any change in it aſterwards. 343. The next object is to ascertain the relation hetween the progressive and rotative motionss. This is most conveniently determined by the space described by the centre during one revolution oſ the system. It may be enounced in the following manner. Let GP (Plate IV. fig. 11.) be drawn ſrom the centre of gravity, perpendicular to FP, the direction of the moving ſorce. Let m express any particle or portion oſ the whole matter m of the body, and let r express its radius vector, or distance ſrom the axis oſ rotation passing through the centre of gravity. The body will make one revolution while its centre G deseribes a line equal to the circumſermre nGPF For it is very obvious that when a hody hoth advances and turns round an axis, a point may be taken in a line connected with that axis and turning with it, at such a distance ſrom the axis, that ĩts velocity of rotation shall be equal to the progressive velocity of the centre. Therefore iſ, in the line PGproduced, we take the point C so situated, it ſollows that the motion of that point, by its rotation round the axis, is equal, and, in this instant, is opposite to the motion oſ the centre, and thereſore compensates it, so that C is at rest in absolute space. With the centre G, and radius GC, describe the circle CVB. Draw the radius vector GA, producing it till it meet the cirele in V. Let GI be the velocity or uniſform motion oſ the centre in some small moment of time. The motion of the point V is compounded of the rotation Væ in the tangent, equal to GI and the progressive motion Væ, also equal and porallel to GI. It therefore moves in ahsolute space with the velocity and in the direclion Vy, the diagonal oſ the rhombus Vo y 2. Draw æ G, and from A draw A d parallel to Væ, meeting æ G in d, and Ab equal and parallel to GI, and produce it till it meet CP in E Complete the parallelogram Ab e d, and draw the diagonal Ae, produeing it till it meet CP in H. Join CV and CA. It is plain that Ae is the absolute motion of the particle A, being compounded oſ the progressive motion Ab equal to GI, and A d the rotative motion of A round the centre of gravity. ence oſ a cirele whose radius is CG, æ The line Vo heing parallel to GI, is perpendicular to CG, and vy, being purallel to Væ, is perpendieular to VG. Thereſore the angles Voy and CGV are equal, and the isosceles triangles Voy and CVG are similar. Therefore the angle CVG is equal to the angle » V4, or its equal ? Vy. Add the angle GV y to both, and the angle CVy is equal to the right angle GV⸗, and CV is perpendicular to Vy. Again, Ab is perpendicular to CG, and b e is perpendicular to AG. Thereſore the angle CGV is equal to the angle Abe. Also Ab: he = Ab: Ad, æ V2: Ad, = VGG: AG, = CG: AG. Thereſore the triangles b e A and GAC are similar, and the angle CAG is equal to the angle Aeb or d Ae. Take avay the common angle GAe, and the remainder CA e is equal to the remainder d AG, and is thereſore a right angle, and Ae is at right angles to AC. Since what has now been demonstrated in relation to the particle A is equally true oſ another particle, it ſollows that the incipient absolute motions oſ every purticle, resulting from the composition oſ these progressive and rotative motions, are found to be at right angles with the lines joining the particles with the point C, or with an axis passing through C, perpendicular to the plane NFG. And since the point or axis C is, in that instant, without motion, and yet the hody is turning round while moving forward, the particles are turning round the momentary axis in C. This is a curious example of the composition oſ motions, and we shall see presently that it is oſ very frequent occurrence, and that a elear conception oſ it will greatly assist us in the discussion oſ many diſficult and important questions. It is obvious that when the circle CVB turns along with the body, it rolls along the line CC parallel to GI, as a coach wheel rolls along a level road, and that point oſ the circumſerenee which is in contact with the line CC is, in that instant, without motion. This point of contact is thereſore the momentary centre oſ motion for every particle oſ matter in the body. They are all heginning, as it were, to deseribe concentric arches having this puint, or the axis passing through this point, for the centre. We are here speaking oſ their real absolute motions in ſree space. For, as the hody is not supposed to change its form, the purticles are also turning round the centre oſ gravity G, while it is carried forward in aæ straight linee. When we consider the motions more particularly, we find that the point C deseribes a succession of eyceloids, having the line CC ſor their base, and that all the other points of the circumſerence CVDB deseribe cycloids, the porticles within and without this circumſerence describing epicyeloĩds, contracted or elongated, according to their situation. The centre of gravity G alone describes a straight line. In every position oſ the body, every particle is moving at right angles to the line joining it with that point oſ the circumſerence CVB which is in contact with the line CC, and the velocity oſ every particle is as its distunce ſrom that point. For as Vy and Ae are deseribed in the same time, and the angular motion of all the body is the same, the angles VC& and ACæ are equal, and thereſore the triangles are similar, and Vy: Ae = VC: AC, that is, the ahsolute velocity oſ the particles are as their distances ſrom C. The ſacts have now been stated and deseribed, and we must, in the next place, shew how all these motions are produced by the excentric impulsion oſ the moving ſorce, and by that means we may determine the situation of the uxis oſ conversion thus assumed by the body. It is plain, in the first place, that the moving ſorce P is equal to the sum of all the ſorces which, when applied at F, in the direction FP, produce all these motions. There is no other source ſrom which they can be derivedl We have considered P as a force which generates the quantity oſ motion m . Thereſore o is the velocity oſ the centre, by vhich it deseribes GI in some moment of time. A portion oſ this ſorce, which we may distinguish as elemental by the symbol m 6, is employed in producing in the particle A the motion A e, which it is observed to take, with a velocity which is to the velocity in C or in N, that is, to the velocity », as CA to CG.We have thereſore CG: CA zæ: 2CA CG by 2 The same symbol will conveniently enough and the velocity o? A is expressed express the quantity oſ motion in A, iſ all the particles be supposed equal, and he expressed by unity. The method which we adopted ſor discovering the ſorce excited in any remote point, by the action oſ a known force at another point, was by finding the proportion of two ſorces which would balance the body between them, when applied to those points, in the same directions; and they were ascertained to be inversely as the perpendiculars on their directions, drawn ſfrom the point to which the third force requisite for completing the balance was appliedl We make use of C as the third point on this occasion, because it is really a ſixed point, remaining at rest, and contributing to the excitation of the ſorce at A, which gives it the motion Ae. C is at rest, in consequence oſ the mutual compensation and balancing of all the forces which are acting on it in the instant of our examination. We are not, at present, interested in knowing the magnitude of any of those forces. It is enough that C is supported.

There is another way in which we may proceed in the same investigation, which has the advantage oſ pointing out something oſ the internal procedure in producing those motions We may examine how it happens that all the forces which act on C come to compensate each other. We may ascertain CGGby means oſ this circumstance, that they are all balanced in that point. A force NF is applied at F, in the direction FP, and we wish to know whãt efſect is produeed on C, in consequence oſ the particle A being dragged into the motion Ae by the material connection between the three poinis F, A, and C. Now the ſorces which are mutually exerted at these three points are such as would balance, if applied there in the same directions. And the three directions ure either parallel, or they meet in one point. In the present case, NF and Ae, which are two oſ the forces, meet in O. Therefore draw OCr. Then Cr is the direction of the excitement in C by such an action at F as produces the motion A e in A Draw PK and PL perpendicular to AO and CO.

The manner in which this theorem is usually demonstrated by the mechanicians, is more ſamiliar, but it is not s0 immediately deduced ſrom the actual state of things, viZ. a body in free space, and unobstructed by ſorces oſ any kind. They begin as we did, by supposing the body impelled at F, in the direction FP, and resisted by an equal and opposite force at the centre oſ gravity. The rotation is then strietly perſformed round that centre, yet does not differ from what it would be without this opposing forcee This supposition makes A move in the direction and with the velocity A d, while G has the velocity GI. We have GA: GVæAd: Væ  GI, v), and then GV: GA =u: = ę ſrom which we obtain, as by the other methods, CG- ſ 4 But this method is not so unexeeptionable as those rhich we have ſollowed, the state oſ things being so very difſerent, nor does it so immediately suggest the composition oſ the two motions. The intelligent reader has perhaps remarked, that the investigation oſ this theorem now before him proceeds on the supposition that all the particles of the body are in the plane oſ the figure, whereas some are above and some below or on the other side of that plane, and it may be doubted whether this simplifieation of the question be admissible But a little refleetion will show, that our conclusions are legitimate, at least with respect to the limited class oſ forms that we are consideringg. We may suppose all such bodies resolved into little prismatic elements, all oſ them perpendicular to the plane of the figure, and thereſore parallel to the axis oſ rotation in C, or in G, which is also perpendicular to that plane. The whole oſ one of those prisms being equidistant ſrom the axis, every atom of it has the same angular motion, and requires the same expenditure m ò oſ the ſorce to excite it into motion as iſ it were in the plane of the figure. It is attached to this plane by its middle, or its centre of gravity, and thereſore both halves oſ it will be equally urged forward. We shall see by and by what other circumstances must be attended to, wvhen these elementary prisms are not bisected by the plane passing through the centre in the direction of the impelling ſoree. In the mean time, we learn all the chieſ properties oſ this motion without the embarrassment arising ſrom a ſarther complicationn. We may now consider a number oſ consequences of this fundamental proposition. Cor. 1. The angular velocity of this motion, measured as usual by the number of revolutions made in a given time, or by the velocity of some point whose distance from the axis is unity, is proportional to the impelling force. For the velocity acquired by the centre of gravity being the same as iſ the body had no rotation, and this being proportional to the force, the time oſ deseribing the line equal to the circumſerence whose radius is CG is diminished in the same proportion, or the number of such circumſerences deseribed in some given time is augmented in the same proportion; thereſore the number of revolutions made in a given time is increased in that proportion. Cor. 2. The angular velocity is also proportional to the distance GP from the axis of gravity at which the body is impressed by the moving foree For CG, and consequently the circumference to be deseribed during one revolution, is inversely as GP. Because, when the body is given, the quantity ſ GA is invariable, in whatever point P the power shall act. Since m. GC. GP is equal to ſhis constant quantity ſ GA?, GC must be inversely as GP. Thereſore the space described in the time of one revolution, and consequently the time oſ describing it, is diminished in the same proportion. Cor. 3. If GC be taken ex in the line perpendicular to FP, the point C will remain at rest in the first moment of the motion. For this reason C, determined in this manner, is called the spontuneous centre of conversion. Cor. 4. The distance CP, between the point of impulsion and the spontaneous axis of conversion is equal to . 2 ſen or l For it is easy to see, as before, a that s PA: ſ GA* + m.

STRENGTE of Materials, in Mechanics, is a subject of 830 much importance, that in a nation so eminent as this for invention and ingenuity in all species of manuſactures, and in particular so distinguished for its improvements in machinery of every kind, it is somewhat singular that no writer has treated it in the detail which its importance and difficulty demands. The man of science who visits our great manuſactories is delighted with the ingenuity which he observes in every part, the innumerable inventions vhich come even ſrom individual artisans, and the determined purpose of improvement and refinement which he sees in every workshop. Every cotton-mill appears an academy oſ mechanical science; and mechanica nvention is spreading from these fountains over the whole kingdom: but the philosopher is mortiſied to see this ardent spirit so cramped by ignorance of principle, and many of these original and brilliant thoughts obseured and clogged with needless and even hurtful additions, and a complication of machinery which checks improvement even by its appearance of ingenuity. There is nothing in which this want of scientific edueation, this ignorance of principle, is so frequently observed as in the injudicious proportion of the parts of machines and other mechanical structures; proportions and forms of parts in which the strength and position are nowise regulated by the strains to which they are VOL. I. 2a exposed, and where repeated ſailures have been the only lessons. It cannot be otherwis. We have no means oſ instruetion, except two very short and abstracted treatises oſ the late Mr Emerson on the strength of materials. We do not recollect a performance in our language from which our artists can get inſormation. Treatises written expressly on different branches of the mechanical arts are totally silent on this, which is the basis and only principle of their performancess. Who would imagine that PRicE'S BEITIsH CaRPENTEE, the work oſ the ſirst reputation in this country, and of which the sole aim is to teach the carpenter to erect solid and durable structures, does not contain one proposition or one reason by which one form of a thing ean be shown to he stronger or weaker than another? We doubt very much if one carpenter in an hundred can give a reason to convince his oWvn mind that a joist is stronger when laid on its edge than when laid on its broad sidee We speak in this strong manner in hopes of exciting some man of science to publish a system of instruetion on this subject. The limits of our work will not admit of a detail: but we think it necessary to point out the leading principles, and to give the traces oſ that systematic connexion by which all the knovledge already possessed of this subject may be brought together and properly arranged. This we shall now attempt in as brief a manner as we are able. The strengih of materials arises immediately or ultimately ſrom the cohesion oſ the parts of bodiess. Our examina* Since this article was published, several sets of experiments of very considerable importance have been made on the strength of materials. The reader is particularly referred to the article CARPENTRY, in the Epinnunou Encvcrorænia, vol. V. ꝑ. 404, Mr Barlows ingenious Essay on the Strength of Timher, and Mr Tredgold's Elementary Principles of Carpentry (Lond. 1810), work of great practical utility ED. STRENGTH OF MATERIALS. 71 tion of this property of tangible matter has as yet been very partial and imperfect, and by no means enables us to apply mathematical calculations with precision and success. The various modifications of cohesion, in its different appearances of perſect softness, plasticity, ductility, elasticity, hardness, have a mighty influence on the strength of bodies, but are hardly susceptible of measurement. Their texture also, vhether uniform like glass and ductile metals, crystallized or granulated like other metals and freestone, or fibrous like timber, is a circumstance no less important; yet even here, although we derive some advantage from remarking to which oſ these forms of aggregation a substance belongs, the aid is but smal. All we can do in this want of general principles is to make experiments on every class of bodies. Accordingly philosophers have endeavoured to instrucet the public in this particular. The Royal Society of London at its very first institution made many experiments at their meetings, as may be seen in the ſirst registers of the Society. Several individuals have added their experimentss The most numerous collection in detail is by Muschenbroek, professor oſ natural philosophy at Leyden. Part oſ it was published by himselſ in his Essois de Physique, in two vols 4t0; but the full colleetion is to be found in his System oſ Natural Philosophy, published after his death by Luloſs, in three vols 4to. This was translated ſrom the Low Duteh into French by Sigaud de la Fond, and published at Paris in 1760, and is a prodigious collection of physical knowledge of all kinds, and may almost suffice for a library of natural philosophy. But this collection of experiments on the cohesion of bodies is not of that value which one expects. We presume that they were carefully made and faithfully narrated; but they were made on such small specimens, that the unavoidable natural inequalities of growth or texture produced irregularities in the results which bore too great a proportion to the whole quantities observedlc We may make the same remark on the experiments of Couplet, Pitot, De la Hire, DuHamel, and others of the French academy. In short, iſ we exeept the experiments of Buſfon on the strength of timber, made at the public expense on a large scale, there is nothing to he met with from vhich we can obtain absolute measures which may be employed with confidence; and there is nothing in the English language, exeept a simple list by Emerson, which is merely a set of affirmations, without any narration of circumstances, to enable us to judge oſ the validity oſ his conclusions: but the character of Mr Emerson, as a man of knowledge and integrity, gives even to these assertions a considerable value. But to make use of any experiments, there must be employed some general principle by which we can generalize their resultss. They vill otherwise be only narrations of detached factss. We must have some notion oſ that intermedium, by the intervention oſ which an external force applied to one part of a lever, joist, or pillar, occasions a strain on a distant part. This can be nothing but the ohesion between the parts. It is this conneeting force which is brought into action, or, as ve more shortly express it, excited. This aetion is modified in every part by the laws oſ mechanics. It ĩs this action which is what we call the strength oſ that part, and its eſſect is the strain on the adjoining parts; and thus it is the same force, differently viewed, that constitutes both the strain and the strength. When we consider it in the light of a resistance to fracture, we call it strength. We eall every thing a force which ve observe to be ever accompanied by a change of motion; or, more strictly speaking, we infer the presence and agency oſ a foree whereever we observe the state of things in respeet of motion different from what we know to be the result of the action of all the forces which we know to act on the body. Thus vwhen we observe a rope prevent a body from falling, ve inſer a moving fſoree inherent in the rope with as much conſidence as vhen we observe it drag the body along the ground. The immediate action of this force is undoubtedly exerted between the immediately adjoining parts of the rope. The immediate effet is the keeping the particles of the rope together. They ought io separate by any external foree drawing the ends of the rope contrariwise; and we ascribe their not doing so to a mechanical force really opposing this external ſorce When desired to give ĩt a name, we name it ſfrom what we conceive to be its eſfect, and thereſore its characteristic, and we call it couESsION. This is merely a name ſor the ſact; but it is the same thing in all our denominationss We know nothing oſ the causes but in the effects; and our name ſor the cause is in fact the name of the effect, which is conESION. We mean nothing else by gravitation or magnetism. What do ve mean when ve say that Newton understood thoroughly the nature of gravitation, of the force of gravitation? or that Franklin understood the nature of the electric ſorce? Nothing but this: Newton considered with patient sagacity the general ſacts oſ gravitation, and has deseribed and classed them with the utmost precision. In like manner, we shall understand the nature of cohesion vhen wæ have discovered vith equal generality the laws oſ cohesion, or general ſacts which are observed in the appearances, and when we have deseribed and classed them with equal accuracy. Let us therefore attend to the more simple and obvious phenomena of eohesion, and mark with care every circumstance of resemblance by which they may be classed Let us receive these as the laws of cohesion, characteristic ofſ its supposed cause, the force of cohesion. We cannot pretend to enter on this vast researeh. The modiſications are innumerable: and it would require the penetration oſ more than Newton to detect the circumstance of similarity amidst millions of diseriminating circumstances. Yel this is the only way of discovering which are the primary facts characteristic of the force, and which are the modifications. The study is immense, but by no means desperate; and we entertain great hopes that it ill ere long be successfully prosecuted: but, in our particular predicament, we must content ourselves with selecting such general laws as seem to give us the most immediate information of the cireumstances that must be attended to by the mechanician in his construetions, that he may unite strength with simplicity, economy, and energy. I45. 1. Then, it is a matter oſ fact, that all bodies are in a certain degree perſectly elastic; that is, when their form or bulk is changed by certain moderate compressions or distractions, it requires the continuance oſ the changing force to continue the body in this new state; and when the force is removed, the body recovers its original form. We limit the assertion to certain moderate changes: for instance, take a lead wire oſ one-ſifteenth of an inch in diameter, and ten ſeet long; fix one end firmly to the ceiling, and let the wire hang perpendicular; affix to the lower end an index like the hand of a watch; on some stand immediately below let there be a circle divided into degrees, with its centre corresponding to the lower point of the wire: now turn this index twice round, and thus twist the wire. When the index is let go, it will turn backwards again, by the vire's untwisting itself, and make almost four revolutions before it stops; aſter which iĩt twists and untwisis many times, the index going backwards and forwards round the circle, diminishing however its arch of twist each time, till at last it settles precisely in iĩts original positionn. This may be repeated for ever. Now, in this motion every part of the vire partakes equally of the twist. The particles are stretched, require force to keep them in their state of extension, and recover completely their relative positions. These are all the characters of hat the mechanician calls perfect elasticity. This is a quality quite ſamiliar in many cases; as in glass, tempered steel, &e. but was thought incompetent to lead, which is generally considered as having little or no elasticity. But we make the assertion in the most general terms, with the limitation to moderate derangement of formm We have made the same experiment on a thread of pipeclay, made by forcing soſt clay through the small hole of a syringe by means oſ a screw; and we found it more elastic than the lead wire: for a thread of one- twentieth oſ an inch diameter and seven ſeet long allowed the index to make two turns, and yet completely recovered iĩts first position. 846. 2. But if we turn the index oſ the lead wire four times round, and let it go again, it untwists again in the same manner, but it makes little more than four turns back again; and aſter many oscillations, it finally stops in a position almost two revolutions removed from its original position. It has now acquired a new arrangement of parts, and this new arrangement is permanent like the former; and, what is of particular moment, it is perfectly elastic. This change is ſamiliarly known by the denomination of a 8ET. The wire is said to have TAREN A s?e?. When ve attend minutely to the procedure of nature in this phenomenon, ve ſind that the particles have as it were slid on each other, still cohering, and have taken a new position, in which their conneceting forces are in equilibrio: and in this change of relative situation, it appears that the connecting forces which maintained the particles in their first situation were not in equilibrio in some position intermediate between that of the first and that of the last form. The force required for changing this first form augmented vith the change, but only to a certain degree; and during this process the connecting forces always tended to the recovery of this first form. But aſter the ehange oſf mutual position has passed a certain magnitude, the union has been partly destroyed, and the particles have been brought into new situations; such, that the ſorces which now connet each vith its neighbour tend, not to the recovery oſ the first arrangement, but to push them farther from it, into a nev situation, to which they now verge, and require force to prevent them ſrom acquiring The wire is now in fact again perfectly elastic; that is, the forces which now conneet the particles with their neighbours augment 1o a certain degree as the derangement from this new position augments. This is not reasoning from any theory. It is narrating facts, on which a theory is to be founded. What we have been just now saying is evidently a description oſ that sensible ſorm of tangible matter which we call ductility. It has every gradation oſ variety, from the soſtness of butter to the firmness of gold. All these bodies have some elasticity; but we say they are not perfectly elastic, because they do not completely recover their original form when it has been greatly damaged. The whole gradation may be most distinctly observed in a piece of glass or hard sealing-wax. In the ordinary form glass is perhaps the most completely elastic body that ve know, and may be bent till just ready to snap, and yet completely recovers its first form, and takes no set whatever; but vhen heated to such a degree as just to be visible in the dark, it loses its brittleness, and becomes so tough that it cannot be broken by any blow; but it is no longer elastic, takes any set, and keeps it. When more heated, it becomes as plastic as clay; but in this state is remarkably distinguished ſrom clay by a quality which we call viscipiTY, which is something like elasticity, o? which clay and other bodies purely plastic exhibit no appearancee This is the joint operation of strong adhesion and soſtnesss When a rod of perfectly soft glass is suddenly stretched a little, it does not at once take the shape which it acquires aſter some little time. Tt is owing to this, that in taking the impression of a seal, if ve take oſf the seal while the wax is yet very hot, the sharpness oſ the impression is destroyed immediately. Each part drawing its neighbour, and each part yielding, the prominent parts are pulled down and blunted, and the sharp hollows are pulled upwards and also blunted. The seal must be kept on till all has become not only stiſf but hard. This viscidity is to be observed in all plastic bodies vhich are homogeneous. It is not observed in clay, hecause it is not homogeneous, but consists of hard particles of argillaceous earth sticking together by their attraction for water. Something like it might hbe made of finely powdered glass and a clammy fluid such as turpentine. Viscidity has all degrees of softness till it degenerates to ropy fluidity like that of olive oil. Perhaps something of it may be found even in the most perfect fluid that we are acquainted with, as we observed in the experiments for ascertaining speciſic gravity. There is in a late volume of the Philosophical Transactions a narrative of experiments, by which it appears that the thread oſ the spider is an exception to our ſirst general law, and that it is perfeetly duetilee It is there asserted, that a long thread oſ gossamer, furnished vith an index, takes any position whatever; and that though the index be turned round any number oſ times (even many hundreds), it has no tendency to recover its first formm The thread takes completely any set hatever. We have not had an opportunity oſ repeating this experiment, but we have distinctly observed a phenomenon totally inconsistent vith it. If a fibre of gossamer about an inch long be held by the end horizontally, it bends downward in a curve, like a slender slip of whalebone or a hair. If totally devoid oſ elasticity, and perſectly indiſferent to any set, it would hang down perpendicularly without any curvature. When ductility and elasticity are combined in diſferent proportions, an immense variety oſ sensible modes oſ aggregation may be produced. Some degree oſ both are probably to be observed in all hodies of complex constitution; that is, which consist oſ particles made up of many diſfer6 ent kinds of atoms. Such a constitution of a body must aſford many situations permanent, but easily deranged. In all these changes of disposition which take place among the particles of a ductile body, the particles are at such a distance that they still coheree The body may be stretched a little; and on removing the extending force, the body shrinks into its first form. It also resists moderate compressions; and vhen the compressing force is removed, the body swells out againn. Now the corpuscular fact here is, that the particles are acted on by attractions and repulsions, which balance each other when no external force ĩs acting on the body, and which augment as the particles are made, by any external cause, to recede ſrom this situation of mutual inactivity; for since force is requisite to produce either the dilatation or the compression, and to maintain it, ve are obliged, by the constitution of our minds, to infer that it is opposed by a force accompanying or inherent in every particle of dilatable or compressible matter; and as this necessity of employing force to produce a change indicates the agency of these corpuscular forces, and marks their kind, according as the tendencies of the particles appear to be toward each other in dilatation, or from each other in compression; so it also measures the degrees of their intensity. Should it require three times the force to produce a double compression, we must reckon the mutual repulsions triple when the compression is doubled; and so in other instances. We see from all this that the phenomena of cohesion indicate some relation between the centres oſ the particles. To discover this relation is the great problem in corpuscular mechanism, as it was in the Newtonian investigation of the force of gravitation. Could we discover this law of action between the corpuscles with the same certainty and distinctness, we might with equal confidence say what vill be the result oſf any position which ve give to the particles of bodies; but this is beyond our hopes. The law of gravitation is so simple, that the discovery or detection of it amid the variety of celestial phenomena required but one step; and in its own nature its possible combinãtions still do not greatly exceed the povers of human research. One is almost disposed to say that the Supreme Being has exhibited it to our reasoning powers as suſficient to employ with success our utmost efforts, but not so abstruse as to discourage us from the noble attempt. It seems to be otherwise with respect to cohesionn. Mathematios informs us, that if it deviates sensibly from the lav of gravitation, the simplest combinations will make the joint action oſ several particles an almost impenetrable mystery. We must therefore content ourselves, for a long time to come, vith a careful observation of the simplest cases that we can propose, and with the discovery oſ secondary laws of action, in which many particles cõmbine their influencee In pursuance oſ this plan, ve observe, 4. 8. That whatever is the situation of the particles of a body with respect to each other, when in a quiescent state, they are kept in these situations by the balance of opposite forces. This cannot be reſused, nor can we form to ourselves any other notion of the state oſ the particles of a body. Whether we suppose the ultimate particles to be oſ certain magnitudes and shapes, touching each other in single points of cohesion; or whether we (ith Boscovieh) consider them as at a distance from each other, and acting on ench other by attractions and repulsionsve must acknowledge, in the first place, that the centres of the particles (by whose mutual distances ve must estimate the distance of the particles) may and do vary their distances from each other. What else can we say when we observe a body increase in length, in breadth, and in thickness, by heating it, or when we see it diminish in all these dimensions by an external compression ? A particle, therefore, situated in the midst of many others, and remaining in that situation, must be conceived as maintained in ĩt by the mutual balancing of all the forces which connect it with its neighbours. It is like a ball kept in its place by the opposite action of two springs This illustration merits a more particular applicationn. Suppose a number oſ balls ranged on the table in the angles of equilateral triangles, and that each ball is connected with the six which lie around it by means of an elastic wire curled like a cork-screv; suppose such another stratum of balls above this, and parallel to it, and s0 placed that each ball of the upper stratum is perpendicularly over the centre of the equilateral triangle below, and let these be connected with the balls of the under stratum hy similar spiral wires. Let there be a third and a fourth, and any number of such strata, all connected in the same manner. It is plain that this may extend to any size and fill any spaceNov let this assemblage of balls be firmly contemplated by the iagination, and be supposed to shrink continually in all its dimensions, till the balls, and their distances from each other, and the connecting wires, all vanish from the sight as diserete individual objects. All this is very conceivablee It ill now appear like a solid body, having length, breadth, and thickness; it may be compressed, and vill again resume its dimensions; it may be stretched, and vill again shrink; it will move avay when struck; in short, it will not diſfer in its sensible appearance ſfrom a solid elastic body. Now when this body is in a state of compression, for instance, it is evident that any one of the balls is at rest, in consequence of the mutual balancing of the actions of all the spiral wires which connect it with those around it. It vill greatly conduce to the full understanding of all that follows to recur to this illustration. The analogy or resemblance between the effects of this constitution oſ things and the effeets oſ the corpuscular forces is very great; and wherever it obtains, ve may safely draw conclusions ſrom vwhat we know would be the condition of a body oſ common tangible matter We shall just give one instruetive example, and then have done with this hypothetical body. We can suppose it of a long shape, resting on one point; we ean suppose two weights A, B, suspended at the extremities, and the whole in equilibrio. We commonly express this state of things by saying that A and B are in equilibrio. This is very inaceurate. A is in fuet in equilibrio with the united action oſ all the springs which eonnect the ball to which it is applied with the adjoining balls: These springs are brought into action, and each is in equilibrio with the joint action of all the rest. Thus through the whole extent of the hypothetieal body, the springs are brought into action in a way and in a degree which mathematics can easily investigat. We need not do this: it is enough for our purpose that our imagination readily discovers that some springs are stretehed, others are compressed, and that a pressure is excited on the middle point oſ support, and the support exerts a reaction which precisely balances it; and the other weight is, in like manner, in immediate equilibrio with the equivalent of the actions oſ all the springs which connect the last ball with its neighbours. Now take the analogical or resembling case, an oblong piece of solid matter, resting on a fulerum, and londed vith two weights in equilibrio. For the actions of the connecting springs substitute the corpuscular forces, and the result will resemble that of the hypothesis. Newton had said, that, as the great movements oſ the solar system were regulated by ſorces operating at a distance, and varying with the distance, 50 he strongly suspected (valde suspicor) that all the phenomena of eohesion, vith all its modifications in the different sensible forms of aggregation, and in the phenomena oſ chemistry and physiology, resulted from the similar agency of forces varying vith the distance of the particles The learned Boscovich, in his celebrated Theory of Natural Philosophy, pursued this thought; and has shown, that i we suppose an ultimate atom of matter endowed vith powers of attraction and repulsion, varying, both in kind and degree, ith the distance, and if this force be the same in every atom, it may be regulated by such a relation to the distance ſrom the neighbouring atom, that a colleetion of such may have all the sensible appearance of bodies in their different forms of solids, liquids, and vapours, elastic or unelastic, and endowed vith all the properties which we perceive, by whose immediate operation the phenomena of motion by impulse, and all the phenomena of chemistry, and of animal and vegetable economy, may be produced. He shows, that notwithstanding a perfect sameness, and even a great simplicity in this atomical constitution, there will result from this union all that unspeakable variety of form and property which diversify and embellish the face oſ nature. Having already given an account of this celebrated work, we mention it only, by the bye, as far as a general notion of it vill be of some service on the present occasion. For this purpose, we just observe that Boscovich conceives a particle of any individual species of matter to consist oſ an unknown number oſ particles of simpler constitution; each of which particles, in their turn, is compounded of particles still more simply constituted, and so on through an unknown number of orders, till we arriveat thè simplest possible constitution of a particle of tangible matter, susceptible of length, breadth, and thickness, and necessarily consisting of four atoms of matter. And he shows that the more complex we suppose the constitution of a particle, the more must the sensible qualities of the aggregate resemble the observed qualities of tangible bodies. In particular, he shows how a particle may be so constituted, that although it act on one other particle of the same kind through a considerable interval, the interposition of a third particle oſ the same kind may render it totally, or almost totally, inactive; and therefore an assemblage of such particles woulũ form such a fluid as air. All these curious mſerences are made with incontrovertible evidence; and the greatest encouragement is thus given to the mathematical philosopher to hope, that, by cautious and patient proceeding in this vay, ve may gradually approach to a knovledge oſ the laws of cohesion, that will not shun a comparison even with the Principia oſ Newton. No step can be made in this investigation, but by observing with care, and generalizing with judgment, the phenomena, which are abundantly numerous, and much more at our command than those of the great and sensible motions of bodiess Following this plan, we observe, 48. 4. Tt is matterof ſact, that every body has some degree of compressibility and dilatability; and when the changes of dimension are so moderate that the body completely recovers its original dimensions on the cessation of the changing ſorce, the extensions or compressions are sensibly proportional to the extending or compressing forces; and thereſore the connecting forces are proportional to the distunces of the particles from their quiescent, neutral, or inactive positions. This seems to have been first viewed as a law of nature by the penetrating eye of Dr Robert Hooke, one of the most eminent philosophers oſ the last century. He published a cipher, which he said contained the theory of springiness, and of the motions oſ bodies by the action of springs. It was this, c ei iin os 5 5t t u When explained in his dissertation, published some years aſter, it was ut tensio sic viss This is precisely the proposition just now asserted as a general ſoct, a lav oſ nature. This dissertation is full of curious observations oſ ſacts in support of his assertion. In his application to the motion oſ bodies, he gives his noble discovery of the balance-spring of a watch, which is ſounded on this lawm. The spring, as it is more and more coiled up, or unwound, by the motion of the balance, acts on it with a force proportional to the distance oſ the balance ſrom its quiescent positionn. The balance therefore is acted on hy an accelerating force, which varies in the same manner as the force oſ gravity acting on a pendulum swinging in a cycloid. Its vibrations therefore must be performed in equal time, whether they are wide or narrow. In the same dissertation, Hooke mentions all the facts which John Bernoulli aſterwards adduced in support of Leibnitæs vhimsical doctrine of the foree of bodies in motion, or the doctrine of the vires vivæ; a doctrine which Hooke might justly have claimed as his own, had he not seen its futility. Experiments made since the time of Hooke show that this law is strictly true in the extent to which we have limited it, viz. in all the changes of form which will be completely undone by the elasticity of the body. It is nearly true to a much greater extent. James Bernoulli, in his dissertation on the elastic curve, relates some experiments of his own, which seem to deviate considerably from it; but on close examination they do not. The finest experiments are those of Coulomb, published in some late volumes oſ the memoirs oſ the Academy of Pariss He suspended balls by wires, and observed their motions of oscillation, vhich he found accurately corresponding with this law. 349. 5. It is universally observed, that when the dilatations have proceeded a certain length, a less addition of force is sufficient to inerease the dilatation in the same degree. This is alvays observed when the body has been so far stretched that it takes a set, and does not completely recover its form. The like may be generally observed in compressions. Most persons vill recollect, that in violently stretching an elastic cord, it becomes suddenly weaker, or more easily stretched. But these phenomena do not positively prove a diminution of the corpuscular foree acting on one particle: it more probably arises from the disunion of some particles, hose action contributed to the vhole or sensible effectt. And in compressions ve may suppose something of the same kind; for vhen ve compress a body in one direction, it commonly bulges out in another; and in cases of very violent action some particles may be disunited, whose transverse action had ſormerly balanced purt of the compressing foro. For the reader vill 5 on reflection, that sincœ the compression in one direction causes the body to bulge out in the transverse direction, and since this bulging out is in opposition to the transverse forces oſ attraction, it must employ some part of the compressing force. And the common appearances are in perſect uniformity with this conception of things. When ve press a bit of dryish clay, it swells out and cracks transversely. When a pillar of wood is overloaded, it swells out, and small crevices appear in the direction of the fibres. After this it will not bear half oſ the load. This the carpenters call cRIPPLING; and a knowledge of the circumstances which modiſy it is of great importance, and enables us to understand some very paradoxical appearances, as will be shown by and bye. This partial disuniting oſ particles formerly cohering is, we imagine, the chief reason why the totality of the forces vhieh really oppose an external strain does not inerease in the proportion oſ the extensions and compressions But suſficient evidence will also be given that the forces which would connect one particle with one other partiele do not augment n the accurate proportion of the change oſ distance; that in extensions they increase more slowly, and in compressions more rapidly. But there is another cause of this deviation perhaps equally effectual with the former. Most hodies manifest some degree of ductility. Now what is this? The fact is, that the parts have taken a new arrangement, in which they again coheree Therefore, in the passage to this new arrangement, the sensible ſorees, which are the joint result of many eorpuscular forces, begin to respeet this new arrangement instead of the former. This must change the simple law of corpuseular force, eharacteristie of the partivOL. I. 28 cular species of matter under examination. It does not require much reflection to convince us that the possible arrangements which the particles of a body nſay acquire, vithout appearing to change their nature, must be more numerous according as the particles are of a more complex constitution; and it is reasonable to suppose that the constitution of even the most simple kind of matter that we are acquainted with is exceedingly complex. Our microscopes show us animals so minute, that a heap oſ them must appear to the naked eye an uniform mass with a grain finer than that of the finest marble or razor hone; and yet each of these has not only limbs, but bones, muscular fibres, blood-vessels, fibres, and a blood consisting, in all probability, of globules organized and complex like our own. The imagination is here lost in wonder; and nothing is leſt us but to adore inconceivable art and wisdom, and to exult in the thought that we are the only spectators of this beautiful scene who can derive pleasure from the viev. What is trodden under foot with indiſſerence, even by the half- reasoning elephant, may be made by us the source of the purest and most unmixed pleasure. But let us proceed to observe, 350. 6. That the forces which connect the particles of tangible bodies change by a change of distance, not only in degree, but also in kind. A particle B, Fig. 1, is attracted by A vhen in the situation C or E. It is repelled by it when at Dor F. It is not affected by it when in the situation B. The reader is requested careſully to remark, that this is not an inference founded on the authority of our mathematical figuree The figure is an expression (to assist the imagination) of facts in nature. It requires no ſoree to keep the particles of a body in their quiescent situations: but if they are separated by stretching the body, they endeavour (pardon the figurative expression) to come to- gether againn. If they are brought nearer by compression, they endeavour to recedee This endeavour is maniſested by the necessity of employing force to maintain the extension or condensation; and ve represent this by the different position of our lines. But this is not all: the particle B, which is repelled by A when in the situation F or D, is neutral when at B, and is attracted when at C or E, may be placed at such a distance AG from A greater than AB that it shall be again repelled, or at such a distance AH that it shall again be attracted; and these alterations may be repeated again and again. This is curious and important, and requires something more than a bare assertion for its prooſ. We have already mentioned the most curious and valuable observations of Sir Isaac Newton, by which it appears that light is thus alternately attracted and repelled by bodies. The rings of colour which appear between the object-glasses of long telescopes showed, that in the small interval of ;44 5th of an inch, there are at least an hundred such changes observable, and that it is highly probable that these alternations extend to a much greater distance. At one of these distances the light actually converges towards the solid matter of the glass, which we express shortly, by saying that it is attracted by it, and that at the nẽxt distance it declines from the glass, or is repelled by it. The same thing is more simply inferred ſfrom the phenomena oſ light passing by the edges oſ knives and other opaque bodies. We refer the reader to the experiments themselves, the detail being too long for this place; and ve request him to consider them minutely and attentively, and to form distinet notions of the inferences drawn from them. And ve desire it to be remarked, that although Sir Isaac, in his discussion, always considers light as a set oſ corpuscles moving in free space, and obeying the actions of external forces like any other matter, the particular conclu- sion in which we are just now interested does not at all depend on this notion of the nature of lightt. Should we, with Des Cartes or Huygens, suppose light to be the undulation oſ an elastic medium, the conclusion will be the same. The undulations at certain distances are disturbed by forces directed towards the body, and at a greater distance, the disturbing forces tend ſrom the body. 35I. These and other facts already mentioned, are a few of many thousand, by which it is unquestionably proved that the particles of tangible matter are connected by forees acting at a distance, varying with the distance, and alternately attractive and repulsive. If we represent these forees by the ordinates oſ a curve, it is evident that this curve must cross the axis at all those distances where the forces change ſrom attractive to repulsive, and the curve must have branches alternately above and below the axis. All these alternations of attraction and repulsion take place at small and insensible distances. At all sensible distances the particles are influenced by the attraction of gravitation; and therefore this part of the curve must be a hyperbola whose equation is — What is the form oſ the curve corresponding to the smallest distance of the particles ? that is, what ĩs the mutual action between the particles just before their coming into absolute contact? Analogy should lead us to suppose it to be repulsion: for solidity is the last and simplest form of bodies with which ve are acquainted.Fluids are more compounded, containing ſire as an essential ingredient. We should conclude that this ultimate repulsion is insuperable, for the hardest bodies are the most elastic. We are fully entitled to say, that this repelling force excecds all that ve have ever yet applied to overcome it; nay, there are good reasons for saying that this ultimate repulsion, by which the particles are kept ſrom mathematical contact, is really in- superable in its ovn nature, and that it is impossible to produce mathematieal contact. We shall just mention one of these, which we consider as unanswerablee. Suppose two atoms, or ultimate particles of matter A and B. Let A be at rest and B move up to it with the velocity 2; and let us suppose that it comes into mathematical contact, and impels it (according to the common acceptation of the vord). Both move vith the velocity . This is granted by all to be the final result of the collisionn. Now the instant of time in which this communication happens is no part either of the duration of the solitary motion of A, nor of the joint motion of A and B: it is the separation or boundary between them. It is at once the end of the ſirst, and the beginning of the second, belonging equally to bothh. A was moving vith the velocity 22 The distinguishing cireumstance therefore of its mechanical state is, that it has a determination (however incomprehensible) by which it would move for ever vith the velocity 2, if nothing ehanged it. This it has during the whole oſ its solitary motion, and thereſore in the last instant of this motion. In like manner, during the whole of the joint motion, and therefore in the first instant of this motion, the atom A has a determination by which it would move ſor ever with the velocity I. In one and the same instant, therefore, the atom A has two incompatible determinationss Whatever notion ve can form of this state, which we call velocity, as a distinetion of condition, the same impossibility of conception or the same absurdity occurs. Nor can it be avoided in any other vay than by saying, that this change of As motion is brought about by insensible gradations; that is, that A and B influence each other precisely as they would do if a slender spring were interposed. The two magnets there spoken oſ are good representatives of two atoms endowed with mutual powers of repul- sion; and the communication of motion is accomplished in both cases in precisely the same manner. 252. The simplest particle which can be a constituent of a body having length, breadth, and thickness, must consist of four such atoms, all of which combine their influence on each atom of another such particle It is evident that the curve which expresses the forces that connect two such particles must be totally different from this original curve, this hylarchic principle Supposing the last known, our mathematical knowledge is quile able to discover the first; but when we proceed to compose a body oſ particles, each of which consists of four such particles, ve may venture to say, that the compound force which connects them is almost beyond our search, and that the discovery of the primary force ſfrom an accurate knoledge of the corpuscular forces of this particular matter is absolutely out of our pover. Alll that we can learn is, the possibility, nay the certainty, of an innumerable variety of external sensible forms and qualities, by which different kinds of matter will be distinguished, arising from the number, the order of composition, and the arrangement of the subordinate particles of which a particle of this or that kind of matter is composed. All these varieties vill take place at those small and insensible distances which are between A and H, and may produce all that variety which we observe in the tangible or mechanical forms oſ bodies, such as elasticity, ductility, hardness, soſtness, fluidity, vapour, and all those unseen motions or actions which we observe in fusion and congelation, evaporation and condensation, solution and precipitation, erystallization, vegetable and animal assimilation and secretion, &e. &e. &e. while all bodies must he, in a certain degree, elastic, all must gravitate, and all must be incompenetrable. This general and satisfactory resemblance between the appearance of tangible matter and the legitimate consequence of this general hypothetical property of an atom oſ matter, aſfords a considerable probability that such is the origin of all the phenomena. We earnestly recommend to our readers a coręful perusal of Boscovich's celebrated treatise. A careful perusal is necessary for seeing its value; and nothing will be got by a hasty look at itt. The reader will be particularly pleased with the facility and evidence with which the ingenious author has deduced all the ordinary principles of mechanics, and with the explanation which he has given of ſluidity, and his deduetion from thence of the laws of hydrostaticss. No part oſ the treatise is more valuable than the doctrine of the propagation of pressure through solid bodies. This, however, is but just touched on in the course of the investigation of the principles of mechaniess We shall borrow as much as will suffice for our present inquiry into the strength of materials; and ve trust that our readers are not displeased with this general sketch of the doctrine (if it may be so called) of the cohesion of bodiess. It is curious and important in iĩtself, and is the foundation of all the knowledge ve can acquire of the present articlee We are sorry to say that it is as yet a new subject of study; but it is a very promising one, and we by no means despair of seeing the whole of chemistry brought by its means within the pale of mechanical science The great and distinguishing agency in chemistry is heat, or fire the cause oſ heat; and one oſ its most singular effects is the conversion of bodies into elastic vapour. We have the clearest evidence that this is hrought about by mechanical forces: for it can be opposed or prevented by external pressure, a very familiar mechanieal ſorc. We may perhaps find another mechanical forcæ which will prevent fusion. HAVING now made our readers familiar with the mode oſ action in which cohesion operates in giving strength c solid bodies, ve proceed to consider the strains to whiol this strength is opposed. A piece of solid matter is exposed to four kinds of strains pretty different in the manner of their operation. I. It may be torn asunder, as in the case of ropes, stretchers, king-posts, tye-beams, &e. 2. It may be crushed, as in the case of pillars, posts, und truss-beams. 8. It may be broken across, as happens to a joist or lever of any kind. 4. It may be wrenched or twisted, as in the case of the axle of a wheel, the nail of a press, &e. I. IT MAY BE PULLED ASUNDERE. 358. This is the simplest of all strains, and the others are indeed modifications of it. To this the force of cohesion is directly opposed, with very little modiſication of its action by any particular cireumstances. When a long cylindrical or prismatic hbody, such as a rod of wood or metal, or a rope, ĩs drawn by one end, it must be resisted at the other, in order to bring its coheson into actionn. When it is fastened at one end, ve cannot conceive it any other way than as equally stretched in all its parts; for all our observations and experiments on natural bodies concur in showing us that the forces which connect their particles, in any way whatever, are equal and opposite. This is called the third law of motion; and ve admit its universality, while we aſfirm that it is purely experimental (see PHYS1C5).. Yet ve have met with dissertations by persons of eminent knowledge, where propositions are maintained inconsistent with thiss. During the dispute about the communication oſ motion, some oſ the ablest writers have said, that a spring compressed or stretched at the two ends was gradually less and less com- pressed or stretched from the extremities towards the middle: but the same writers acknowledged the universal equality of action and reaction, which is quite incompatible vith this state of the spring. No such inequality of compression or dilatation has ever been observed; and a little reflection will show it to be impossible, ĩn consistency with the equality of action and reaction. Since all parts are thus equally stretched, it follows, that the strain in any transverse section is the same, as also in every point of that section. If therefore the hody be supposed of a homogeneous texture, the cohesion of the parts is equable; and since every part ĩs equally stretehed, the particles are drawn to equal distances from their quiescent positions, and the forees which are thus exeited, and now exerted in opposition to the straining force, are equal This external force may be increased by degrees, which vill gradually separate the parts of the body more and more from each other, and the connecting ſorces inerease vith this increase of distance, till at last the cohesion of some particles is overcome. This must be immediately followed by a rupture, because the remaining forces are now weaker than hefore. It is the united force of cohesion, immediately hefore the disunion of the first particles, that we eall the sTRENGTH of the section. It may also be properly called its AnSOLUTE sTRENGTH, being exerted in the simplest form, and not modified by any relation to other circumstances. 354. If the external force has not produced any permanent change on the body, and it therefore recovers its former dimensions vhen the force is withdrawn, it is plain that this strain may be repeated as often as we please, and the body which withstands it once vill always withstand it. It is evident that this should be attended to in all construetions, and that in all our investigations on this subject this should be kept strictly in viem When we treat a i piece of soſt elay in this manner, and with this precaution, the force employed must be very small. If we exceed this, we produce a permanent change. The rod of clay is not indeed torn asunder; but it has become somewhat more slender: the number oſ particles in a cross section is now smaller; and thereſore, although it vill again, in this new form, suſfer, or allow an endless repetition of a certain strain without any farther permanent change, this strain is smaller than the former. : Something of the same kind happens in all bodies which receive a sETT by the strain to which they are exposed. All duetile bodies are of this kind. But there are many bodies which are not ductile Such bodies break completely whenever they are stretched beyond the limit of their perſect elasticity. Bodies of a fibrous structure exhibit very great varieties in their cohesion. In some the fibres have no lateral cohesion, as in the case of a rope. The only way in which all the fibres can be made to unite their strength is, to twist them together. This causes them to bind each other so ſast, that any one of them vill break before it can be drawn out of the bundle. In other fibrous bodies, such as timber, the ſibres are held together by some cement or gluten. This is seldom as strong as the fibre. Accordingly timber is much easier pulled asunder in a direction transverse to the fibress There is, however, every possible variety in this particular. In stretching and breaking ſibrous bodies, the visible extension is frequently very considerablee This is not solely the increasing of the distance of the particles of the cohering fibre: the greatest part chiefly arises ſrom drawing the erooked fibre straight. In this, too, there is great diversity; and it is accompanied vith important differences in their poer of ithstanding a strain. In some woods, such as fir, the fibres on which the strength most depends are very straight. Sueh woods are commonly very elastic, do not take a sett, and break abruptly when overstrained: others, such as oak and hirch, have their resisting fibres very undulating and erooked, and stretch very sensibly by a strain. They are very liable to take a sett, and they do not break 0 suddenly, but give warning by complaining, as the carpenters call it; that is, by giving visible signs of a derangement of texturee. Hard bodies of an uniform glassy strueture, or granulated like stones, are elastic through the vhole extent of their cohesion, and take no sett, but break at once when overloaded. Notvithstanding the immense variety which nature exhibits in the structure and cohesion of bodies, there are certain general facts of which wve may now avail ourselves vith advantage. In particular, 355. The absolute cohesion is proportional to the area oſ the section. This must be the case where the texture is perfectly uniform, as we have reason to think it is in glass and the ductile metals. The cohesion oſ each particle being alike, the whole cohesion must be proportional to their number, that is, to the area of the sectionn. The same must be admitted with respect to bodies of a granulated texture, where the granulation is regular and uniform. The same must be admitted of fibrous bodies, if we suppose their fibres equally strong, equally dense, and similarly disposed through the whole section; and this we must either suppose, or must state the diversity, and measure the cohesion accordingly. We may therefore assert, as a general proposition on this subject, that the absolute strength in any part of a body by which it resists being pulled asunder, or the force which must be employed to tear it asunder in that port, is proportional to the area of the section perpendicular to the extending force. Thereſore all cylindrical or prismatical rods are equally strong in every part, and ill break alike in any part; and bodies which have unequal scetions will always break in the slenderest part. The length oſ the eylinder or prism has no effect on the strength; and the vulgar notion, that it is ensier to break a very long rope than a short one, ĩs a very great mistake. Also the absolute strengths of bodies which have similar sections are proportional to the squares of their diameters or homologous sides oſ the seetion. The veight of the body itself may be employed to strain it and to break it. It is evident, that a rope may be s long as to break by its own weight. When the rope is hanging perpendicularly, although iĩt is equally strong in every part, it will break towards the upper end, because the strain on any part is the weight of all that is below it. Its BELATIVE STRENGTH in any part, or power of withstanding the strain which is actually laid on it, is inversely as the quantity below that part. 856. When the rope is stretched horizontally, as in towing ship, the strain arising from its weight often bears a very sensible proportion to its whole strength. Let AEB Fig. 8.) be any portion of such a rope, and AC, BC be tangents to the curve into which its gruvity bends it. Complete the parallelogram ACBD. It is well known that the curve ĩs a catenaria, and that DC is perpendicular to the horizon; and that DC is to AC as the weight of the rope AEB to the strain to A In order that a suspended heavy hody may be equally able in every part to carry its ovn weight, the seetion in that part must be proportional to the solid contents of all that is below it. Suppose it a conoidal spindle, formed by the revolution of the curve A a e (Fig. 4.) round the axis CE. We must have AC?: a  / AEB sol.: a E b sol. This condition requires the logarithmie eurve for A a ę, of which Cc is the axis. These are the chief general rules which can be safely deduced from our clearest notions of the eohesion of hodies. In order to make any practical use of them, it is proper to have some measures of the cohesion of such bodies as are commonly employed in our mechanics, and other structures vwhere they are exposed to this kind of strain. These must be deduced solely from experiment. Therefore they must be considered as no more than general values, or as the averages of many particular trials. The irregularities are very great, because none of the substances are constant in their texture and firmnesss Metals differ by a thousand circumstances unknown to us, according to their purity, to the heat with which they were melted, to the moulds in which they were cast, and the treatment they have aſterwards reeeived, by forging, wire-drawing, tempering, e. It is a very curious and inexplicable ſact, that by forging a metal, or by frequently draving it through a smooth hole in a steel plate, its cohesion is greatly increased. This operation undoubtedly deranges the natural situation of the particles. They are squeezed closer together in one direction; but it is not in the direction in which they resist the fracture. In this direction they are rather separated to a greater distancee The general density, however, is augmented in all of them except lead, which grows rather rarer by wire-drawing: but its cohesion may be more than tripled by this operation. Gold, silver, and brass, have their cohesion nearly tripled; copper and iron have it more than doubled. In this operation they also grow much harder. Jt is proper to heat them to redness after drawing a Ettlee This is called nealing or anncaling. It softens the metal again, and renders it susceptible of another drawing without the risk of eracking in the operation. We do not pretend to give any explanation of this remarkable and very important ſact, vhich has something resembling it in woods and other ſibrous bodies, as will be mentioned afterwards. The varieties in the cohesion oſ stones and other minerals, and of vegetable and animal substances, are hardly susceptible of any description or classiſfication. 857. We shall take for the measure of cohesion the number oſf pounds avoirdupois which are just suſficient to tear asunder a rod or bundle of one inch square From this it vill be easy to compute the strength corresponding to any other dimension. lat, METALS.

It is very remarkahle that almost all the mixtures of metals are more tenacious than the metals themselves. The change of tenacity depends much on the proportion oſ the ingredients, and the proportion which produces the most tenacious mixture is different in the diſferent metals. We have selected the following from the experiments of Muschenbroek. The proportion of ingredients here selected is that which produces the greatest strength.

It is, however, more fusible, which is a great inconvenience. We also see that a very small addition oſ Zine almost doubles the tenacity of tin, and increases the tenacity of lead five times; and a small addition of lead doubles the tenacity oſ tinn. These are economical mixtures. This is a very valuable information to the plumbers for augmenting the strength of waterpipes. By having recourse to these tables, the engineer can proportion the thickness of his pipes (of whatever metal) to the pressures to which they are exposed. L, Voons. 359. We may premise to this part oſ the table the ſollowing general observations: I.The wood immediately surrounding the pith or heart of the tree is the weakest, and its inferiority is so mueh more remarkable as the tree is older. In this assertion, however, we speak with some hesitation. Musehenbroeks detail of experiments is decidedly in the aſfirmative Mr Buſon, on the other hand, says, that his experience has taught him that the heart of a sound tree is the strongest; but he gives no instances. We are certain, from many observations of our own, on very large ouks and firs, that the heart is much weaker than the exterior parts. 2. The wood next the bark, commonly called the white or blea, is also weaker than the rest; and the wood gradually increases in strength as we recede from the centre to the blea. 3. The wood is stronger in the middle oſ the trunk than at the springing of the branches or at the root; and the wood oſ the branches is weaker than that oſ the trunk. 4. The wood oſ the north side oſ all trees which grow in our European climates is the weakest, and that of the south- east side is the strongest; and the diſference is most remarkable in hedge- row trees, and such as grow singly. The heart of a tree is never in its centre, but always nearer to the north side, and the annual coats of wood are thinner on that sidee In conformity with this, it is a general opinion of carpenters that timber is stronger whose annual plates are thicker. The trachea or air-vessels are weaker than the simple ligneous ſibres. These air-vessels are the same in diameter and number of rows in trees of the same species, and they make the visible separation between the annual plates. Therefore when these are thicker, they contain a greater proportion oſ the simple ligneous fibres. 5. All woods dre more tenacious while green, and lose very considerably Ly drying aſter the trees are ſelled. The only author who has put it in our power to judge oſ the propriety of his experiments is Muschenbroek. He has described his method of trial minutely, and it seems unexeeptionable The woods were all formed into slips fit ſor his apparatus, and part of the slip was cut avay to a parallelopiped oſ ; th oſ an inch square, and thereſore '7th of a square inch in section. The absolute strengths oſ a square inch were as ſollows: Ib. Ib. 361. Locust tree 20, 100 Mulberry. 12,500 Jujeb.: 18,500 Villow.. 12,500 DBeech, oak. 17,300 Ash...

Mr Pitot says, on the authority of his own experiments, and oſ those of Mr Parent, that 60 pounds will just tear asunder a square line oſ sound oak, and that it will bear 50 with saſety. This gives 8640 for the utmost strength of a square inch, which is mueh inferior to Musehenbroeks valuation. We may add to these, 562. Ivory. . . . . 1I6,27 Bone . . . . . . 5,250 Horn . . . . . . 8, 750 Whalebone. . . . . 7,500 Tooth oſ sea-calP. . . 4,075 363. The reader will surely observe, that these numbers express something more than the utmost eohesion; ſor the weights are such as will very quickly, that is, in a minute or two, tear the rods asunder. It may be said in general, that two. thirds oſ these weights will sensibly impair the strength after a considerable while, and that one- half is the utmost that ean remain suspended at them without risk for ever; and it is this last allotment that the engineer should reckon upon in his constructions. There is, however, considerable difference in this respect. Woods oſ a very straight fibre, such as ſir, will be less impaired by any load which is not suſficient to break them immediately. According to Mr Emerson, the load which may be saſely suspended to an inch square is as ſollows: Iron. . : : : : . 76,400 Brass . . . : : . 35, 600 Hempen rope. . .. . 19,600 Ivory . ; 15, 700 Oak, box, yew, plum- tree : : 1,550 Elm, ash, heech : : : : 6,070 Walnut, plum. . 5,360 BRed fir, holly, elder, ple, erab : 5,000 Cherry, hazle. . . : 4,760 Alder, asp, birch, willom. : . 4,200 Lead . . : . : . 430 Freestone. : . : : 914 He gives us a practical rule, that a cylinder whose diameter is d inches, londed to one- ſourth oſ its ahsolute strength, will carry as ſollows: Iron . : . 135 Good rope ” oaF.I4 Cut.

It is wonderful that in a matter oſ such unquestionable importance the public has not ennbled some persons of judgment to make proper trials. They are beyond the abilities oſ private persons. II. BODIES MAY BE CRUSHED. 364. It is oſ equal, perhaps greater, importance to know the strain which may be laid on solid bodies without danger of crushing them. Pillars and posts oſ all kinds are exposed to this strain in its simplest ſorm; and there are cases where the strain is enormous, viz. where it arises from the oblique position oſ the parts; as in the struts, braces, and trusses, which occur very ſrequently in our great works. It is thereſore most desirable to have some general Enowledge oſ the principle which determines the strength oſ bodies in opposition to this kind of strain. But unſortunately we are much more at a loss in this than in the last casee. The meehanism of nature is much more complicated in the present case. It must be in some circuitous way that compression can have any tendency to tear asunder the parts of a solid body, and it is very diſficult to trace the steps. If we suppose the particles insuperably hard and in contact, and disposed in lines which are in the direction of the external pressures, it does not appear how any pressure can disunite the particles; but this is a gratuitous supposition. There are infinite odds against this precise arrangement of the lines oſ particles; and the compressibility of all kinds of matter in some degree shows that the porticles are in a situation equivalent to distancee This being the case, and the porticles, with their intervals, or what is equivalent to intervals, being in situations that are oblique with respect to the pressures, it must follow, that by squeezing them together in one direction, they are made to bilge out or separate in other directions. This may proceed so ſar that some may be thus pushed laterally beyond' their limits of cohesion. The moment that this Rappens the resistance to compression is diminished, and the body will now be crushed together. We may ſorm some notion of this by supposing a number oſ spherules, like small shot, sticking together by means oſ a cement. Compressing this in some particular direction causes the spherules to act among each other like so many wedges, each tending to penetrate through hetween the three which lie below it: and this is the simplest, and perhaps the only distinet notion we can have oſ the matter. We have reason to think that the constitution of very homegeneous bodies, such as glass, is not very diſferent ſrom thiss. The particles are eertainly arranged symmetrically in the angles of some regular solidss. It is only such an orrangement that is consistent with transparency, and with the ſree passage of light in erery direction. 365. Iſ this be the constitution of bodies, it appears probable that the strength, or the resistance which they are capable oſ making to an attempt to erush them to pieces, is proportional to the area oſ the section whose plane is perpendicular to the external ſorce; ſor each particle being similarly and equally acted on and resisted, the whole resistance must be as their number; that is, as the extent oſ the section. Accordingly this principle is assumed by the ſew writers who have considered this subjeet; but we conſess that iĩt appears to us very doubtſul. Suppose a number of brittle or ſriable halls lying on a table uniformly arranged, but not cohering nor in contact, and that a board is laid over them and loaded with a weight; we have no hesitation in saying, that the weight necessary to erush the whole collection is proportional to their number or to the area of the section. But when they are in contact (and still more iſ they cohere), we imagine that the ease is materially altered. Any individual ball is crushed only in consequence oſ its being bulged outwards in the direction perpendicular to the pressure employed. IF this could be prevented by a hoop put round the hall like an equator, we cannot see how any ſorce can crush it. Any thing thereſore which makes this bulging outwards more diſſi- cult, makes a greater force necessary Now this eſfect will be produced by the mere contact of the balls beſore the pressure is applicd; for the central ball cannot svell outward laterally without pushing away the balls on all sides of it. This is prevented by the ſriction on the table and upper board, which is at least equal to one third oſ the pressure. Thus any interior ball hecomes stronger by the mere vicinity of the others; and if we ſarther suppose them to cohere laterally, we think that its strength will be still more increased. The analogy between these halls and the cohering particles oſ a ſriable body is very perfect. We should therefore expect that the strength by which it resists being crushed will increase in a greater ratio than that oſ the section, or the square oſ the diameter oſ similar seetions; and that a square inch oſ any matter will bear a greater weight in proportion as it makes a part oſ a greater section. Accordingly, this appears in many experiments, as will be noticed afterwardss. Muschenbroek, Euler, and some others, have supposed the strength oſ columns to be as the biquadrates oſ their diameterss But Euler deduced this ſfrom formulæ which occurred to him in the course oſ his algebraic analysis; and he boldly adopts it as a principle, without looking ſor its ſoundation in the physical assumptions which he had made in the beginning oſ his investigation. But some of his original assumptions were as paradoxical, or at least as gratuitous, as these resulls: and those, in particular, ſrom which this proportion of the strength oſ columns was deduced, were almost ſoreign to the case; and thereſore the inference was oſ no value. Yet it was received as a principle by Muschenbroek, and by the academicians oſ St Petersburgh. We make these very ſfew observations, because the suhject is oſ great practical importance; and it is a great obstacle to improvements when deſerence to a great name, joined to incapacity or indolence, causes authors to adopt his care- less reveries as principles ſfrom which they are aſterwards to drav important consequences. It must be acknowledged that we have not as yet established the relation between the dimensions and the strength oſ a pillar on solid mechanical principless Experience plainly contradicts the general opinion, that the strength is proportional to the area oſ the section; but it is still more inconsistent witli the opinion, that it is in the quadruplicate ratio oſ the diameters of similar sections. It would seem that the ratio depends much on the internal structure of the body; and experiment seems the only method ſfor nscertaining its general laws. S66. If we suppose the hody to be of a fibrous texture, having the ſibres situated in the direction of the pressure, and slightly adhering to each other by some kind oſ cement, such a body will ſail only by the bending oſ the fibres, by which they will break the cement and be detached ſrom each other. Something like this may be supposed in wooden pillarss. In such cases, too, it would appear that the resistance must be as the numher oſ equally resisting fibres, and as their mutual support, jointly, and thereſore as some ſunction oſ the area of the section. The same thing must happen if the ſibres are naturally crooked or undulated, as is ohserved in many woods, &e. provided we suppose some similarity in their form. Similarity oſ some kind must always be supposed, otherwise we need never aim at any general inſerences. In all cases thereſore we ean hardly reſuse admitting, that the strength in opposition to compression is proportional to a function oſ the area oſ the section. As the whole length oſ a eylinder or prism is equally pressed, it does not appear that the strength oſ a pillar is at all aſſeeted by its length. Iſ indeed it be supposed to bend under the pressure, the ease is greatly changed, heeause it is then exposed to a transverse strain; and this increases with the length of the pilla. But this will he considered with due attention under the next class oſ strains. Few experiments have been made on this species oſ strength and strainn. Mr Pitot says, that his experiments, and those oſ Mr Parent, show that the force necessary for crushing a body is nearly equal to that which will tear it asunder. He says that it requires something more than 60 pounds on every square line to erush a piece oſ sound oak. But the rule is by no means general: Glass, for instance, will carry a hundred times as much as oak in this way, that is, resting on it; but will not suspend above four or five times as much Oak will suspend a great deal more than fir; but fir will carry twice as much as a pillar. Woods oſ a soſt texture, although consisting of very tenacious fibres, are more easily erushed by their loadl. This softness of texture is chieſly owing to their fibres not being straight but undulated, and there being considerable vacuities between them, so that they are easily bent laterally and erushedld When a post is overstrained by its load, it is observed to swell sensibly in diameter. Increasing the load causes longitudinal cracks or shivers to appear, and it presently aſter gives way. This is called crippling. In all cases where the fibres lie oblique to the strain the strength is greatly diminished, because the parts can then be made to slide on each other; when the cohesion oſ the cementing matter is overcome. Muschenbroek has given some experiments on this subject; but they are cases oſ long pillars, and thereſore do not belong to this placee They will be considered aſtervards. The only experiments of which we have seen any detail (and it is useless to insert mere assertions) are those of Mr Gauthey, in the 4th volume of Ro⸗iers Journal de Physique. This engineer exposed to great pressures small rectangular parallelopipeds, cut ſfrom a great variety oſ stones, and noted the weights which erushed them. The ſollowing table exhibits the medium results oſ many trials on two very uniſorm kinds of freestone, one of them among the hardest and the other among the soſtest used in building. 367. Column lst expresses the length oſ& the section in French lines or 12ths of an inch; column 2d expresses the breadth; column 3d is the area of the seetion in square lines; column 4th is the number oſ ounces required to crush the piece; column bith is the weight which was then horne by each square line of the seetion; and column 6th is the round numbers to which Mr Gauthey imagines that those in column 5th approximate.

It is evident, however, that the strength inereases much faster than the area oſ the section, and that a square line can carry more and more weight, according as it makes a part of a larger and larger section. In the series of experiments on the soſt stone, the individual strength oſ a square line seems to inerease nearly in the proportion oſ the section oſ which it makes a part. Mr Gauthey deduces, from the whole oſ his numerous experiments, that a pillar oſ hard stone oſ Givry, whose section is a square foot, will bear with perfect saſety 664, 000 pounds, and that its extreme strength is 571,000, and the smallest strength observed in any oſ his experiments vas 460,000. The soft bed of Givry stone had for its smallest strength 187,000, for its greatest 311,000, and for its saſe load 249,000. Good brick will carry with safety 320,000; chalk will carry only 9500. The boldest piece oſ architecture in this respect which he has seen is a pillar in the church of AllSaints at Angers. It is 24 feet long and Il inches square, and is loaded with 60,000, which is not ;th oſ what is necessary for crushing it. 365. We may observe here by the way, that Mr Gauthey's measure oſ the suspending strength oſ stone is vastly small in proportion to its power oſ supporting a load laid above it. He finds that a prism oſ the hard bed of Givry, oſ a foot section, is torn asunder by 4600 pounds; and iſ it be firmly fixed horizontally in a wall, it will be broken by a weight oſ 56,000 suspended a foot ſrom the wall. Iſ it rest on two props at a ſoot distance, it will be broken by 206,000 laid on its middlee These experiments agree so ill with each other, that little use can be made of them. The subject is oſ great importance, and well deserves the attention oſ the patriotic philosopher. 369. A set oſ good experiments would be very valuable, because it is against this kind of strain that we must guard by judicious construction in the most delicate and difficult problems which come through the hands oſ the civil and military engineer. The construction oſ stone arches, and great wooden bridges, and puarticularly the construction oſ the frames oſ carpentry ealled centres in the erection of stone bridges, are the most difficult jobs that occur. In the centres on which the arches oſ the bridge oſ Orlenns were huilt, some oſ the pieces oſ oak were carrying upwards oſ two tons on èvery square inch of their scantlingg. All who saw it said that it was not able to earry the fourth part oſ the intended load. But the engineer understood the principles oſ his art, and ran the risk: and the result completely justified his confidence; for the centre did not complain ĩin any part, only it was ſound too supple: so that it went out oſ shape while the haunches only oſ the areh were laid on itt. The engineer corrected this by loading it at the erown, and thus kept it completely in shape during the progress of the work. In the old Memoirs oſ the Academy oſ Petersburgh ſor 1778, there is a dissertation by Euler on this subjeet, but particularly limited to the strain on columns, in which the bending is taken into the account. Mr Fuss has trented the same suhject with relation to carpentry in a subsequent volume. But there is little in these papers hesides a dry mathematical disquisition, proceeding on nssumptions which (to speak favourably) are extremely gratuitouss. The most important consequence oſf the compression is wholly overlooked, as we shall presently see. Our knowledãe oſ the mechanism of cohesion is as yet ſar too imperſect to entitle us to a confident application oſ mathematics. Experiments should be multiplied. 370. The only way we can hope to make these experiments useſul is to pay a careful attention to the manner in which the ſracture is producedc By discovering the general resemblances in this partieular, we advance a step in our power oſ introducing mathematical measurement. Thus, when a cubical piece oſ chalk is slowly erushed between the chaps oſ a vice, we see it uniſormly split in æ surſace oblique to the pressure, and the two parts then slide along the surſace of fracture. This should lead us to examine mathematically #hat relation there is between this surface oſ fracture and the necessary force; then we should endeavour to determine experimentally the position oſ this surſace Having discovered some general law or resemblance in this cireumstance, ve should try what mathematical hypothesis will agree with thiss Having found one, we may then apply our simplest notions of cohesion, and compare the result oſ our computations with experiment. We are authorised to say, that a series oſ experiments have been made in this way, and that their results have been very uniſorm, and thereſore satisfactory, and that they will soon be laid beſore the publie as the ſoundation of successſul practice in the construetion oſ arches. III. A BODY MAY BE BROKEN ACROSS. 371. The most usual, and the greatest strain, to which materials are exposed, is that which tends to break them transversely. It is seldom, however, that this is done in a manner perſectly simple; ſor when a beam projects horizontally ſrom a wall, and a veight is suspended ſrom its extremity, the heam is commonly broken near the wall, and the intermediate part has perſormed the funetions oſ a lever. It sometimes, though rarely, happens that the pin in the joint oſ a pair oſ pincers or scissars is cut through by the strain; and this is almost the only case of a simple transverse ſracturee Being so rare, we may content ourselves with saying, that in this case the strength oſ the piece is proportional to the area oſ the section. 372. Experiments were made for discovering the resistances made by two hodies to this kind of strain in the following manner: Two iron hars were disposed horizontally at an inch distance; a third hung perpendicularly between them, being supported by a pin made oſ the substance to be examined. This pin was made oſ a prismatic form, so as to fit exactly the holes in the three bars, which were made very exact, and oſ the same size and shape.. A scale was suspended at the lower end of the perpendicular har, and loaded till it tore out that part of the pin which ſilled the middle hole This weight was evidently the measure oſ the lateral cohesion oſ two sections. The side-bars were made to grasp the middle bar pretty strongly between them, that there might he no distance imposed between the opposite pressures. This would have combined the energy oſ a lever with the purely transverse pressure. For the same reason it was necessary that the internal parts oſ the holes should he no smaller than the edges. Great irregularities occurred in our first experiments ſfrom this cause, because the pins were somewhat tighter within than at the edges; but when this was corrected they were extremely regular. We employed three sets oſ holes, viæ. a tircle, a square (hich was occasionally made a rectangle whose length was twice its breadth), and an equilateral trianglee We found in all our experiments the strength exactly proportional to the area oſ the section, and quite independent oſ its figure or position, and we found it considerably ahove the direct cohesion; that is, it took considerably more than twice the force to tear out this middle piece than to tear the pin asunder by a direct pul. A piece of fine ſreestone required 205 pounds to pull iĩt directly asunder, and 575 to break it in this way. 373. The difſerence was very constant in any onesubstance, but varied ſrom àds to àds in different kinds oſ matter, heing smallest in bodies oſ a fibrous texturee But indeed we could not make the trial on any bodies oſ considerable cohesion, because they required such ſorces as our appa- ratus could not support. Chalk, clay haked in the sun, baked sugar, brick, and freestone, were the strongest that we could examine. But the more common case, where the energy oſ a lever intervenes, demands a minute examination. 374. Let DABC (Plate V. ſig. 1.) be a vertical section of a prismatic solid (that is, of equal size throughout); projecting horizontally from a wall in which it is firmly fixed; and let a weight P be hung on it at B, or let any power P act at B in a direction perpendicular to AB. Suppose the body of insuperable strength in every part except in the vertical section DA, perpendicular to its length. It must break in this section only. Let the cohesion be uniform over the whole of this section; that is, let each of the adjoining particles oſ the two parts cohere with an equal force f. There are tvo ways in which it may break. The part ABCD may simply slide down along the surface of ſracture, provided that the power acting at B is equal to the accumulated ſforce which is exerted by every particle of the seetion in the direetion AD. But suppose this eſſectually prevented hy something that supports the point A The action at P tends to make the body turn round A (or round a horizontal line passing through A at right angles tio AB) as round a joint. This it cannot do without separating at the line DA. In this case the adjoining particles at D or at E will be separated horizontally. But their cohesion resistæ this separation. In order, thereſore, that the ſracture may happen, the energy or momentum of the power P, neting by means of the lever AB, must be superior to the uccumulated energies of the particles The energy of each depends not only on its eohesive force, but also on its situation; for the supposed insuperable firmness oſ the rest oſ the body makes it a lever turning round the fulorum A, and the cohesion of each particle, such as D or E, acts by means oſ the arm DA or EA. The energy oſ each particle will thereſore be had by multiplying the ſorce exerted by it in the instant oſ ſracture by the arm of the lever by whieh it acts. Let us thereſore first suppose, that in the instant oſ ſracture every particle is exerting an equal ſoree . The energy oſ D will be ſx DA, and that oſ E will be ſx EA, and that of the whole will be the sum oſ all these products. Let the depth DA oſ the section be called d, and let any undetermined part oſ it EA be called æ, and then the space occupied by any particle will he z. The cohesion of this space may be represented by ſ æ, and that oſ the whole by  d. The energy by vhich each element of the line DA, or d, resists the fracture, will be f x, and the whole accumulated energies will be ſ x I x 2. This we know to be ſx à dẽ, or fdx 4 d It is the same thereſore as if the cohesion fd of the whole section had been acting at the point G, which is in the middle oſ DA. The reader who is not ſamiliarly acquainted with the ſluxionary calculus may arrive at the same conclusion in another way. Suppose the heam, instead of projecting horizontally ſrom a wall, to he hanging ſrom the eeiling, in which it is firmly fixed. Let us consider how the equal cohesion oſ every part operates in hindering the lower part ſrom separating ſrom the upper by opening round the joint A The equal cohesion operates just as equal gravity would do, hut in the opposite direction. Now we know, by the most elementary mechanies, that the eſſeet oſ this will be the same as iſf the whole weight were concentrated in the centre of gravity G of the line DA, and that this point G is in the middle of DA. Now the number oſ fibres being as the length d oſ the line, and the cohesion oſ each ſibre being ſ, the cohesion of the whole line is ſ x d or ſ d. The accumulated energy thereforè of the cohesion in the instant oſ fracture is ſd x  d. Now this must he equal or just inſerior to the energy of the power employed to break it. Let the length AB be called I; then P x I is the corresponding energy oſ the power. This gives us fd b d =p I for the equation of equilibrium corresponding to the vertical section ADCB. Suppose now that the ſracture is not permitted at DA, but at another section 3 æ more remote from B. The body being prismatic, all the vertical sections are equal; and therefore ſd J d is the same as beforee. But the energy oſ the power is hy this means increased, being now =PX B, instead of P x BA: Hence we see that when the prismatic body is not insuperably strong in all its parts, but equally strong throughout, it must break close at the wall, where the strain or energy of the power is greatest. We see, too, that a power which is just able to break it at the wall is unable to break it anywhere else; also an absolute cohesion ſ d, which can withstand the power ꝑ in the section DA, will not withstand it in “the section ? , and will withstand more in the section da. This teaches us to distinguish between absolute and relative strength. The relative strength oſ a seetion has a reſerence to the strain actually exerted on that section. This relative strength is properly measured by the power which is just able to balance or overcome it, when applied at its proper Place. Now since we had ſd ; dæpl, sſd we have  / ſor the measure oſ the strength of the seetion na' in relation to the power applied at B. If the solid is a rectangular beam; whose breadth is b, it is plain that all the vertical sections are equal, and that AG or  d is the same in al. Thereſore the equation expressing the equilibrium hetween the momentum oſ the external ſorce and the accumulated will be p l æſd h x } d. The produet d b evidentſy expresses the area oſ the section oſ ſracture, vhich we may call 5, and we may express the equilibrium thus,  l =æfs } d, and 2l: d=fs:ꝑ Now ſ5 is a proper expression of the absolute eohesion oſ the section oſ ſracture, and ꝑ is a proper measure oſ its strength in relation to a power applied at B. We may thereſore say, that tuice the length of a rectangular beam is to the depth as the absolute cohesion to the relutive strength. Since the action oſ equable cohesion is similar to the detion of equal gravity, it ſollows, that whatever is the figure oſ the section, the relative strength will be the samo as iſ the absolute cohesion oſ all the ſibres were acting at the centre oſ gravity oſ the sectionn. Let  be the distance between the centre of gravity oſ the section and the axis oſ ſracture, we shall have p l =fs g, and l: g=ſ: ꝑ. It will be very useſul to recollect this analogy in words: “The length of a prismatic beum of uny shape is to the height of the centre of gravity above the lower side, as the absolute cohesion to the strength relative to this length Because the relative strength oſ a rectangular beam is ſhad a opſba: ba⸗ 11 2i oſ difſerent henms are proportional to the absolute cohesion of the particles, to the breadth, and to the square of the depth directly, and to the length inversely; also in prisms whose sections are similar, the strengths are as the cubes oſ the diameters. 375. Such are the more general results oſ the mechanism of this transverse strain, in the hypothesis that all the porticles are exerting equal ſorees in the instant oſ ſracture. We are indebted for this doctrine to the celebrated Galileo; and it was one oſ the first specimens oſ the application of mathematics to the science oſ nature. VOL. I. P omenta of cohesion  it ſollows, that the relative strengths We have not included in the preceding investigation that action oſ the external force by which the solid is drawn sidewise, or tends to slide along the surface of ſracture. We huve supposed a particle E (fig. I.) to be pulled only in the direction E e, perpendicular to the section of fracture, by the action oſ the crooked lever BAE. But it is also pulled in the direction EA; and its reaction is in some direction: E, compounded oſ. f, by which it resists being pulled outwards: and. e, by which it resists being pulled downwardss We are but imperſectly acquainted with the force: e, and only know that their accumulated sum is equal to the force p: but in all important cases which occur in practice, it is unnecessary to attend to this force; because it is so small in comparsion of the ſorces in the direction E e, as we easily conclude ſrom the usual smallness of AD in comparison oſ AB. 376. The hypothesis of equal cohesion, exerted by all the particles in the instant of ſracture, is not conſormahle to nature: ſor wve know, that when a force is applied transversely at B, the beam is bent downwards, hecoming convex on the upper side; that side is thereſore on the stretch. The particles at D are farther removed from each other than those at E, and are thereſore actually exerting greater cohesive ſorces. We cannot say with certainty and precision in what proportion each fibre is extended. It seems most probable that the extensions are proportional to the distances ſrom A We shall suppose this to be really the case Now recollect the general law which we formerly said was observed in all moderate extensions, viz. that the attractive forces exerted by the dilated particles were proportional to their dilatations. Suppose now that the beam is so much bent that the particles at D are exerting their utmost ſorce, and that this fibre is just ready to break or actually breaks: It is plain ihat a total fracture must immediately ensue; because the force which was superior to the ſull cohesion of the particlè at D, and a certain portion oſ the cohesion oſ all the rest, will be more than superior to the ſull cohesion of the particle next within D, and a smaller portion oſ the cohesion oſ the remainder. Now let F represent, as before, the ſull force of the exterior fibre D, which is exerted by it in the instant oſ its breaking, and then the force exerted at the same instant by the ſibre E will be had by this analogy AD: AE, or a: x=F t , and the force really exerted by the ſibre Eis ſfx 5 The force exerted by a fibre whose thickness is æ is thereore ſ ; but this ſoree resists the strain by acting by means oſ the lever EA or x. Its energy or momen,: tum is therefore and the accumulated momenta x 2 T This, vhen æ is taken equal to d, will express the momentun oſ the whole fibres in the line AD. This, thereIq⸗ fore, nriæ, or f aè, or fd x} d. Now f d expresses the absolute cohesion oſ the whole line AD: The accumulated momentum is therefore the same as if the ahsolute cohesion of the whole linè were exerted at ;d of AD ſrom A. 377. From these premises it ſollows that the equation expressing the equilibrium oſ the strain and cohesion is pl æpfd x } d; und hence we deduce the analogy,  As thrice the length is to the depth, s0 is the ubsolute cohesion to the relative strength This equation and this proportion will equally apply to oſ all the fibres in the line AE will be ſ x sum oſ rectangular heams whose breadth is b; for we shall then have p l m fb d x j d. We also see that the relative strength is proportional to the ahsolute cohesion oſ the particles, to the breadth, and to the square oſ the depth directly, and to the length inversely: for p is the measure oſ the force with which re3 ſ" In this respect, thereſore, this hypothesis agrees with the Galilean; hut it assigns to every beam a smaller proportion oſ the absolute cohesion of the section oſ ſracture, in the proportion of 3 to 2. In the Galilean hypothesis this section has a momentum equal to à oſ ils absolute strength, but in the other hypothesis it is only 3d. In beams oſ a diſſerent ſorm the proportion may be diſſerent. As this is a most important proposition, and the ſoundation oſ many practical maxims, we are anxious to have it clearly comprehended, and its evidence perceived by all. Our better inſormed readers will therefore indulge us while we endeavour to present it in another point oſ view, where it will be better scen by those who are not ſamiliarly acquainted with the ſluxionary calculus. 38. Fig. 2. oſ Plate V. is a perspective view oſ a three sided heam, projecting horizontally from a wall. and loaded with a weight at B just suſſicient to break it. DABC is a vertical plane through its highest point D, in the direction oſ its length. u Do is another vertical section perpendicular to AB. The piece being supposed oſ insuperable strength everywhere, except in the section a D a, and the cohesion heing also supposed insuperable along the line o Aq, it can break nowhere but in this seetion, and by turning round a A a as round a hinge. Make D d equal to AD, and let D d represent the absolute cohesion oſ the fibre at D, which absolute cohesion we expressed by the symbol ſ. Let a plane a da be made to pass through a a and d, and let d ' & be another cros seeit is resisted, and ) tion. It is plain that the prismatic solid contained hetween the two sections a Da and a d ' will represent the full cohesion of the whole section of fracture; for we may conceive this prism as made up of lines such as F f, equal and parallel to D d representing the absolute cohesion oſ each particle such as F. The pyramidal solid d Da a, cut off by the plane d a a, will represent the cohesions actually exerted by the different fibres in the instant of ſracture. For take any point E in the surſace of ſracture, and draw E e parallel to AB, meeting the plane a d a in e, and let e AE be a vertical plane. It is evident that D d is to Ee as AD to AE; and thereſore (since the ſorces exerted by the difſerent fibres are as their extension, and their extension as their distances ſrom the axis of ſracture) E e will represent the force actually exerted by the fibre in E while D is exerting its full force D d. In like manner, the plane F F ſf expresses the cohesion exerted by all the ſibres in the line FF, and so on through the whole surface. Thereſore the pyramid d a a D expresses the accumulated exertion of the whole surſace of ſracture. Farther, suppose the beam to be held perpendicular to the horizon, with the end B uppermost, and that the weight oſ the prism contained between the two sections a Da and a' d d (now horizontal) is just able to overcome the full cohesion of the section oſ fracture The weight oſ the pyramid d D a a will also be just able to overeome the cohesions actually exerted hy the diſſerent fibres in the instant oſ fracture, because the weight oſ each fibre, such as E e, is just superior to the cohesion actually exerted at E. Let o he the centre oſ gravity oſ the pyramidal solid, and draw o O perpendicular to the plane a Da. The whole weight oſ the solid d D a a may be conceived as accumulated in the point o, and as acting on the point O, and it will have the same tendency to separate the two ecohering surſaces as vhen each ſibre is hanging by its re- spective point. For this reason the point O may be called the centre of actual effort of the unequal ſorces oſ cohesionThe momentum, thereſore, or energy by which the cohering surſaces are separated, will be properly measured by the weight of the solid d D a a multiplied by OA; and this produet is equal to the product oſ the weight ꝓ multiplied by BA, or by . Thus, suppose that the cohesion along the line AD only is consideredl The whole cohesion will be represented by a triangle A D d. D d represents 7, and AD is d, and A d is x. Thereſore AD d is à Jd. The centre oſ gravity o oſ the triangle A D d is in the intersection oſ a line drawn ſrom A to the middle oſ D d with a line drawn ſrom d to the middle of AD; and thereſore the line o O will make AO æà of A d. Therefore the actual momentum of eohesion is ſf x à d x  d, m ſxdx 3 d mfd x } d, or equal to the absolute cohesion acting by means of the lever - If the section of ſracture is a rectangle, as in a common joist, whose breadth ao is = b, it is plain that all the vertical lines will be equal to AD, and their cohesions will be represented by triangles like A D d; and the whole actual cohesion will be represented by a wedge whose bases are vertical planes, and vhich is equal to halſ of the parallelopiped AD x D d x a a, and will thereſore be =3 ſb d; and the distance AO oſ its centre oſ gravity ſrom the horizontal line AA vill be 3 of AD The momentum of cohesion oſ a joist will thereſore be à fbd x § d, or ſhd } d, as we have determined in the other way. The beam represented in the figure is a a triangulor prism. The pyramid Da a d is j oſ the prism o a Dd a'u If we make s represent the surface oſ the triangle a D , the pyramid is ; oſ ſf. The distance AO oſ its centre oſ gravity ſrom the horizontal line AA is ; oſ AD, or à d. Thereſore the momentum of actual cohesion is  ſfæx4d, m ſs 3 d; that is, it is the same as iſ the ſull cohesion of all the fibres were accumulated at a point T whose distance from A is  of AD or d; or (that we may see its value in every point of view) it is ; of the momentum oſ the ſull cohesion oſ all the fibres when accumulated at the point D, or acting at the distance d=AD. This is a very convenient way oſ conceiving the momentum of actual cohesion, by comparing it with the momentum oſ absolute cohesion applied at the distance AD ſrom the axis oſ ſracturee The momentum oſ the absolute cohesion applied at D is to the momentum oſ actual eohesion in the instant oſ fracture as AD to AI. Thereſore the length oſ AI or its proportion to AD, is a sort of index of the strength of the beam. We shall call it the InDEX, and express it by the symhol ĩ. Its value is easily obtained. The product oſ the absolute cohesion by AI must he equal to that oſ the actual cohesion by AO. Therefore say, as the prismatic solid aa Dda adis to the pyramidal solid a a D d, s0 is AO to AL We are assisted in this determination by a very convenient circumstance. In this hypothesis oſf the actual cohesions heing as the distances oſ the ſibres ſrom A, the point O is the centre oſ oscillation or percussion of the surſace D a a turning round the axis a a; for the momentum of cohesion oſ the line FF is FF x F f x EA FF x EA?, hecause Fſis equal to EAA Now AO, by the nature oſ the centre of gravity, is equal to the sum of all these momenta divided by the pyramid a a Dd; that is, by the sum oſ all the FF x Ff; that is, by the sum of sum of FF x EA? all the FF x EA. Thereſore AOæ um of FF x E” which is just the value of the distance oſ the centre of percussion oſ the triangle a a D ſfrom A. Moreover, if G be the centre of gravity of the triangle a D a, we shall have DA to GA as the absolute cohesion to the sum oſ the cohesions actually exerted in the instant oſ ſracture; ſor, by the nature oſ this centre oſ gravity, AG is equal to sum oſ FF x EA sum oſ Fr the sum oſ FF x EA. But the sum oſ all the lines FF is the triangle a Da, and the sum oſ all the PF x EA is the sum oſ all the rectangles FF ſſ; that is, the pyramid d D a a. Thereſore a prism whose buse is the triangle a D a, and whose height is AG, is equal to the pyramid, or will express the sum oſ the actual cohesions; and a prism, whose hase is the same triangle, and whose height is D d or D a, expresses the absolute cohesion. Therefore DA is to GA as the absolute eohesion to the sum of the actual cohesions. Consequently we have DA: GA = OA: TA. Thereſore, vhatever be the form of the beam, that is, whatever be the figure oſ its seetion, ſind the eentre of oscillation O, and the centre oſ gravity G of this section. Call their distances ſrom the axis oſ ſfracture o and 2. Then , and the sum of FF x AG is equal o AI ori E, and the momentum oſ cohesion is ſ⸗ x n 4, where s is the area oſ ſracture. This index is easily determined in all the cases which generally occur in practice:. In a reetangular beam AI is 3 d of AD; in a eylinder (circular or elliptic) AI is,bę-ths of AD, &e. In this hypothesis, that the cohesion actually exerted by each fibre is as its extension, and that the extensions of the ſibres are as their distances from A (Plate V. ſig. .), it is plain that the ſorces exerted hy the fibres D, E, &e. will he represented by the ordinates Dd, Ee, &e. to a straight line Ad. And we learn ſrom the principles oſ Rorarios that the centre oſ percussion O is in the ordinate which passes through the centre oſ gravity oſ the triangle AD d, or (iſ we consider the whole seetion having breadth as well as depth) through the centre of gravity of the solid bounded by the planes DA, d A; and we ſound that this point O was the centre oſ effort of the cohesions actually exerted in the instant oſ ſracture, and that I was the centre of an equal momentum, which would be produced iſ all the fibres were accumulated there and exerted their full cohesion. This consideration enables us to determine, with equal ſacility and neatness, the strength oſ a heam in any hypothesis oſ forces. The ahove hypothesis was introduced with a cautious limitation to moderate strains, which produced no permanent change oſ form, or no sett as the artists call it: and this suffices for all purposes oſ practice, seeing that it would be imprudent to expose materials to more violent strains. But when we compare this theory with experiments in which the pieces are really broken, considerable deviations may be expeeted, because it is very probuble that in the vicinity oſ rupture the forces are no donger proportional to the extensions. 379. That no doubt may remain as to the justness and completeness oſ the theory, we must shew how the relative strength may he determined in any other hypothesis. Thereſore suppose that il has been established by experiment on any kind of solid matter, that the forces actually exerted in the instant oſ fracture by the fibres at D, E, &e. are as the ordinates D d, E, &e. oſ any curve line Ac d. We are supposed to know the ſorm of this curve, and that of the solid which is hounded by the vertical plane through AD, and by the surſace which passes through this eurve A ? d perpendicularly to the length of the beam. We know the place oſ the centre oſ gravity oſ this curve surſace or solid, and can draw a line through it parallel to AB, and cutting the surface oſ fracture in some point O. This point is also the centre oſ efſort oſ all the cohesions actually exerted; and the product oſ AO, and of the solid which expresses the actual cohesions, will give the momentum oſ cohesion equivalent to the ſormer ſs Or we may find an index AI, by making AI a fourth proportional to the ſull cohesion of the surface oſ fracture, to the accumulated actual cohesions, and to AO; and then ſ5 xi (7AI) will be the momentum oſ cohesion; and we shall still have I for the point in which all the fibres may be supposed to exert their ſull cohesion f, and to produce a momentum of cohesion equal to the real momentum oſ the cohesions actually exerted, and the relative strength of the beam will still be s : : or I . Thus, iſ the forces be as the squares oſ the extensions (still supposed to be as the distances from A), the curve Ac a will be the common parahola, having AB for its axis and AD for the tangent at its vertex. The area AD d will be 3d AD x Dd; and in the case oſ a rectangular beam, AO will be ths AD, and AI will be th of AD. We may observe here in general, that if the ſorces actually exerted in the instant of fracture be as any power q of the distance ſfrom A, the index AI will be for a rectangular heam, and the momentum of cohesion will always be (cæteris paribus) as the breadth and as the square oſ the depth; nay, this will be the case whenever the action of the fibres D and E is expressed by any similar functions of d and . This is evident to every reader acquainted with the ſluxionary calculus. As ſar as we can judge ſrom experience, no simple algebraic power oſ the distance will express the actual cohesions oſ the fibress. No curve which has either AD or AB ſor its tangent will suit. The ohservations which we made in the beginning show, that although the curve of Pl. III fig. I. must be sensibly straight in the vicinity of the points of interseetion with the axis, in order to agree with our observations which show the moderate extensions tobe as the extending ſorces, the curve must he concave towards the axis in all its attractive branches, because it cuts it again. Thereſore the curve Ae d oſ Plate V. ſig. l. must make a finite angle with AD or AB, and it must, in all prohability, be also concave towards AD in the neighbourhood of d. It may however he convex in some part oſ the intermediate archh We have made experiments on the extensions of diſferent bodies, and find great diversities in this respect: But in all, the moderate extensions were as the ſorces, and this with great accuracy till the body took a sett, and remained longer than formerly when the extending ſorce vas removed. We must now remark, that this correction oſ the GaliIean hypothesis oſf equal forces was suggested by the bending which is observed in all bodies which are strained transversely. Because they are bent, the fibres on the convex side have heen extendedl. We cannot say in what proportion this obtains in the different fibres. Our most distinet notions oſ the internal equilibrium between the particles render it highly prohable that their extension is proportional to their distance ſrom that fibre which retains its former dimensionss But by whatever law this is regulated, ve see plainly that the actions of the stretched fihres must follow the proportions of some ſunetion of this distance, and that thereſore the relative strength of a beam is in all cases susceptible oſf mathemotical determination. . 880. We also see an intimate connection between the strain and the curvature. This suggested to the celebrated James Bernoulli the problem oſ the EtasTic Cunve, i: e. the curve into which an extensible rigid body will be hent by a transverse strain. His solution in the Acta Lipsiæ 1694 and 1695 is a very beautiſul specimen of mathematical discussion; and we recommend it to the perusal of the curious reader. He will find it very perspicuously treated in the first volume of his works, published aſter his death, where the wide steps which he had taken in his investigation are explained so as to be easily comprehended. His nephew Dan. Bernoulli has given an elegant abridgment in the Petersburgh Memoirs for 1729. The problem is too intricate to be fully discussed in æ work like this; but it is also too intimately connected with our present subject to be entirely omitted. We must content ourselves with showing the leading mechanical property oſ this curve, ſrom which the mathematician may deduee all its geometrical properties. 381I. When a bar oſ uniform depth and breadth, and of a given length, is bent into an arch of a circle, the extension of the outer fibres is proportional to the curvature; ſor, because the curves formed by the inner and outer sides of the beam are similar, the circumſerences are as the radii, and the radius of the inner circle is to the difference of the radii, as the length of the inner circumference is to the difference of the circumferencess The diſference of the radii is the depth of the beam, the difſerænce of the circumferences is the extension oſ the outer fibres, and the inner circumſference is supposed to be the primitive length oſ the beam. Now the second and third quantities of the above analogy, viæ. the depth and length of the heam, are constant quantities, as is also their product. Therefore the produet oſ the inner radius and the extension of the outer fibre is also a constant quantity, and the whole extension of the outer fibre is inversely as the radius oſ curvature, or is directly as the curvature of the beam. i The mathematical reader will readily see, that into whatever curve the elastic bar is bent, the whole extension of the outer fibre is equal to the length oſ a similar curve, having the same proportion to the thickness oſ the beam tliat the length oſ the heam has to the radius oſ curvature. Now let ADCB (Pl. V. fig. 3.) be such a rod, oſ uniſorm breadth and thickness, firmly fixed in a vertical position, and bent into a-curve AEFB by a weight W suspended at B, and of such a magnitude that the extremity B has its tangent perpendicular to the action of the weight, or purallel to the horizon. Suppose too that the extensions are proportional to the extending ſoreess From any two points E and F draw the horizontal ordinates EG, FH. It is evident that the exterior fibres of the sections E e and F ſ are stretehed by ſorces which are in the proportion oſf EG to FH (these being the long arms of the levers, and the equal thickuesses E , F f being the short arms). Thereſore (by the hypothesis) their extensions are in the same proportion. But because the extensions are proportional to some similar functions of the distance ſrom the axes oſ ſracture E and F, the extension oſ any fibre in the seetion E e is to the contemporaneous extension oſ the similarly situated fibre in the section F f, as the extension of the exterior fibre in the section E e is to the extension of the exterior fibre in the section F : therefore the whole extension oſ E e is to the whole extension of F ſ as EG to FH, and EG ĩ3 to FH as the curvature in E to the curvature in F. Here let it be remarked, that this proportionality oſf the curvature to the extension of the fibres is not limited to the hypothesis of the proportionality of the extensions to the extending forces. It follows from the extension in the difſerent sections heing as some similar function of the distance from the axis oſ ſracture; an assumption which cannot be reſused. This then is the ſundamental property of the elastic curve, ſrom which its equation, or relation between the abscissa and ordinate, may be deduced in the usual forms, und all its other geometrieal propertiess These are ſo- reign to our purpose; and we shall notice only such properties as have an immediate relation to the strain and strength of the difſferent parts oſ a ſlexible body, and which in particular serve to explain some diſficulties in the valuable experiments of Mr Buffon on the Strength oſ Beams. 382. We observe, in the first place, that the elastie curve cannol he a cirele, but is gradually more incurvated as it recedes from the point oſ application B of the straining forces. At B it has no eurvature; and iſ the bar were extended beyond B there would be no curvature there. In like manner, when a beam is supported at the ends and loaded in the middle, the curvature is greatest in the middle; but at the props, or beyond them, iſ the beam extend farther, there is no curvature. Therefore when a heam projecting 20 feet ſrom a wall is bent to a certain curvature at the wall by a weight suspended at the end, and a beam of the same size projecting 20 ſeet is bent to the very same curvature at the wall by a greater weight at 10 ſeet distance, the figure and the mechanical state oſ the beam in the vicinity of the wall is different in these two cases, though the curvature at the very wall is the same in both. In the first case every part of the beam is incurvated; in the second, all beyond the IO feet is without curvature. In the first experiment the curvature at the distance of five feet from the wall is Jths oſ the curvature at the wall; in the second, the curvature at the same place is but à of that at the wal. This must weaken the long beam in this whole interval oſ five ſeet, because the greater curvature is the result oſ a greater extension oſ the fibres. 383. In the next place, ve may remerk, that there is a certain determinate curvature for every beam which cannot he exceeded without breaking it; for there is a certain separation of two adjoining particles that puls an end 1o their cohesionn. A ſibre can thereſore hbe extended only a certain proportion oſ its length. The ultimate extension oſ the outer fibres must bear a certain determinate proportion to its length, and this proportion is the same with that oſ the thickness (or what we have hitherto called the depth) to the radius oſ ultimate curvature, which is thereſore determinate. 384. A beam oſ uniform brendth and depth is thereſore most incurvated where the strain is greatest, and will break in the most incurvated part. But by changing its form, so as to make the strength oſ its difſerent sections in the ratio oſ the strain, it is evident that the curvature may he the same throughout, or may be made to vary according to any law. This is a remark worthy oſ the attention oſ the watchmaker. The most delicate problem in practical mechanics is s5o to taper the balancespring of a wateh that its wide and narrow vibrations may be isochronous Hooke's principle ut tensio sic vis is not sufficient when we take the inertia and motion of the spring itselſ into the account. The figure into which it bends and unbhends has also an inſluencee Our readers vill take notice that the artist aims at an accuracy which will not admit an error oſ ;55355th, and that Harrison and Arnold have actually attained it in several instances. The taper oſ a spring is at present a nostrum in the hands oſ each ortist, and he is careſul not to impart his gecret. Again, since the depth oſ the beam is thus proportional to the radius oſ ultimate curvature, this ultimate or breaking curvature is inversely as the depth. It may be exl pressed by i 385. When a weight is hung on the end of a prismatic beam, the curvature is nearly as the weight and the length directly, and as the breadth and the cube oſ the depth ina versely; ſor the strength is b a⸗ Let us suppose tl 5 5 l . that this produces the ultimate curvature vi Now let the beam be loaded with a smaller weight », mo the curvature produced be C, we have this analogy ?ru HUA EI . : : : C, and C æ Jtœ It is evident that this is also true oſ a beam supported at the ends and loaded hetweer the props; and we see how to determine the curvature in its difſerent parts, whether arising ſrom the load, or from its own weight, or from both. 356. When a beam is thus loaded at the end or middle, the loaded point is pulled down, and the space through which it is drawn may be ealled the nEFLECTION. This may be considered as the sub-tense oſ the angle oſ contact, or as the versed sine oſ the arch into which the beam is hent, and is thereſore as the eurvature when the length of the arches is given (the ſflexure being moderate), and as the square of the length oſ the arch when the curvature is given. The deſlection thereſore is as the curvature and as  he  sppso of the length of the arch jointly; that i nu2tũ 7 x I?, or as 7a The deflection ſrom the primitive shape is thereſore as the bending weight and the eube oſ the length direcily, and as the breadth and cube of the depth inversely. 387. In beams just ready to break, the curvature is as the depth inversely, and the deſleetion is as the square oſ the length divided by the depth; for the ultimate curvature at the breaking part is the same whatever is the length; and in this case the deſlection is as the square of the length. We have been the more particular in our consideration oſ this subject, hecause the resulting theorems aſſord us the finest methods of examining the laws of corpuscular action, that is, ſor discorering (he variation of the force 6F cohesion by a change oſ distance. It ĩs true it is not the atomical law, or HYLARCEIC PRINCIPLE, as it may justly he called, which is thus made accessible, hut the speciſic law oſ the perticles of the substance or kind of matter under examination. But even this is a very great point: and coincidences in this respect among the difſerent kinds oſ matter are oſ great moment. We may thus learn the nature oſ the corpuscular action oſ diſſerent substances; and perhaps approach to a discovery oſ the mechanism of chemical aſfinities. For that ehemical actions are insensible cases oſ local motion is undeniable, and local motion is thè province of mechanical discussion; nay, we see that these hidden changes are produced by mechanical forces in many important cases, for we see them promoted or prevented by means purely mechanical. The conversion oſf bodies into elastic vapour by heat can at all times be prevented by a sufficient external pressure. A strong solution oſ Glauber's salt will congeal in an instant by agitation, giving out its latent heat; and it will remain ſluid for ever, and return its latent heat in a close vessel which it completely fills. Even water will by such treatment ſreeze in an instant by agitation, or remain fluid for ever hy confinement. We know that heat is produced or extricated by ſriction, that eertain compounds of gold or silver with saline maiters explode with irresistible violence by the smallest pressure or agitation. Such facts should rouse the mathematical philosopher, and excite him to ſollow out the conjectures oſ the illustrious Newton, encouraged by the ingenious attempts oſ Boscovich; and the proper beginning oſ this study is to attend to the laws of attraction and repulsion exerted by the particles of eohering hodies; discoverable by experiments made on their actual extensions and compressionss. The experiments oſ simple extensions and compressions are quite insufſicient, because the total stretching of a wire is s0 small a quantity, that the mistake oſ the 1000th part vOL. J. 2e oſ an inch occasions an irregularity which deranges any progression so as to make it uselesss But by the bending of hodies, a distension oſ 3,th of an inch may be easily magnified in the deſlection oſ the spring ten thousand times. We know that the investigation is intricate and difficult, but not beyond the reach oſ our present mathematical attainments; and it will give very ſine opportunities of employing all the address oſ analysis. In the last century and the beginning of the present this was a sufficient excitement to the first geniuses of Europe. The cycloid, the catenaria, the elastic curve, the velaria, the caustics, were reckoned an abundant recompense for much study; and James Bernoulli requested, as an honourable monument, that the logarithmic spiral might be inseribed on his tombstone. The reward for the study to which we nov presume to incite the mathematicians is the almost unlimited extension oſ natural science, important in every particular branch. To go no further than our present subject, a great deal oſ important practical knowledge respecting the strength of bodies is derived from the single observation, that in the moderate extensions which happen heſore the parts are overstrained, the ſorces are nearly in the proportion oſ the extensions or separations oſ the particless To return to our subject. 388. James Bernoulli, in his second dissertation on the elastic curve, calls in question this law, and accommodates his investigation to any hypothesis concerning the relation of the ſorces and extensions. He relates some experiments oſ lute strings where the relation was considerably diſſerent. Strings oſ three ſeet long, Stretched by 2, 4, 6, 8, I0 pds. Were lengthened 9, 17, 23, 27, S0 lines. But this is a most exceptionable ſorm oſ the experiment. The strings were twisted, and the mechanism oſ the extensions is here exceedingly complicated, combined with compressions and with transverse twists, 5cc. We made experiments on fine slips oſ the gum enoutchoue, and on the juice of the berries oſ the white bryony, of which a single grain ill draw to a thread oſ two feet long, and again return into a perſectly round sphere. We measured the diameter oſ the thread by a microscope with a mierometer, and thus could tell in every state oſ extension the proportional number of particles in the sections. We found, that though the whole range in whieh the distance oſ the particles was echanged in the proportion of I3 to 1, the extensions did not sensibly deviate ſrom the proportion oſ the ſorces. The same thing was observed in the eaoutehouc as long as it perſectly recovered its first dimensions. And it is on the authority oſ these experiments that we presume to announce this as a lav oſ nature. : 369. Dr Rohert Hooke was undoubtedly the ſirst who attended to this subject, and assumed this as a law oſ naturee. Mariotte indeed was the first who expressly. used it ſor determining the strength oſ beams: this he did about the 1679, correcting the simple theory oſf Galileoo. Leibnitæ indeed, in his dissertation de Resistentlia Solidorum, in the Acta Eruditorum 1684, introduces this consideration, and wishes to he regarded as the discoverer; and he is always acknowledged as sueh by the Bernoullis and others who adhered to his peculiar doetrines. But Mariotte had published the doetrine in the most express terms long beſore; and Bulfinger, in the Comment, Petropol. 1729, completely vindicates his claim. But Hooke was unquestionably the discoverer of this law. It made the foundation of his theory of springs, announced to the Royal Society about the year 1661, and read in I666. On this occasion he mentions many things on the strength oſ bodies as quite ſamiliar to his thoughts, whieh are immediate deductions from this principle; and among these oll the facts which John Iernoulli adduces in support oſ Leibnitæ's notions about the ſorce oſ hodies ĩn motion. 890. But even with this first correction of Mariotte, the mechanism of transverse strain is not fully nor justly explained. The ſorce acting in the direction BP (Plate V. fig. 1.), and bending the body ABCD, not only stretches the fibres on the side opposite to the axis of ſracture, but compresses the side AB, which hecomes eoncave by the strain. Indeed it cannot do the one without doing the other: For in order to stretch the fibres at D, there must be some fſulerum, some support, on which the virtual lever BAD may press, that it may tear asunder the stretched fibress. This fulerum must sustain hoth the pressure arising ſrom the cohesion of the distended fibres, and also the action oſ the external ſorce, which immediately tends to cause the prominent part of the beam to slide along the section DA Let BAD thereſore he considered as a erooked lever, o which A is the fulcrum. Let an external ſorce he applied at B, in the direction BP, and let a force equal to the accumulated cohesion of AD be applied at O in the direction opposite to AB, that is, perpendicular to AO; and let these two forces be supposed to balance each other by the intervention of the lever. In the first place, the ſorce at O must be to the ſorce at B as AB to AO: Therefore, if we make AK equal and opposite to AO, and AL equal and opposite to AB, the common principles of mechanics inſorm us that the fulerum A is affected in the same manner as if the two ſorces AK and AL were immediately applied to it, the ſoree AK being equal to the weight P, and AL equal to the accumulated cohesion actually exerted in the instant of ſracture. The fulerum is thereſore really pressed in the direetion AM, the diagonal oſ the parallelogram, and it must resist in the direction and vith the force MA; and this power oſ resistance, this support, must be furnished by the repulsive ſorces exerted by those purticles only which are in a state oſ actual compression. The force AK, which is equal to the external force P, must be resisted in the direction KA by the lateral cohesion oſ the whole particles between D and A (the partiele D is not only drawn forward but downward). This prevents the part CDAB ſrom sliding down along the section DA. 391. This is fully verified by experiment. If we attempt to break a long slip oſ cork, or any such very compressible body, we always observe it to bulge out on the concave side beſore it cracks on the other side. If it is a body oſ fibrous or ſoliated texture, it seldom ſails splintering ofſf on the concave side; and in many cases this splintering is very deep, even reaching halſ way through the piece. In hard and ~ranulated bodies, such as a piece of ſreestone, chalk, dry clay, sugar, and the like, ve generally see a considerable spſinter or shiver ſly off from the hollow side. Iſ the ſracture be slowly made by a ſorce at B gradually augmented, the ſormation oſ the splinter is very distinctly seen. It forms a triangular piece like a Ib, which generally breaks in the middle We doubt not but that attentive observation would show that the direction oſ the crack on each side oſ I is not very difſerent ſrom the direction AM and its correspondent on the other side. This is by no means a circumstance oſ idle curiosity, but intimately connected with the mechanism oſ cohesion. 302. Let us see what consequences result ſrom this state oſ the case respecting the strength of bodies. Let D A KC (Plate V. fig. 4.) represent a vertical section oſ a prism of compressible materials, such as a piece oſ timber. Suppose it loaded with a weight P hung at its extremity. Suppose it also of such a oonstitution that all the fibres in AD are in a state of dilatation, while those in A A are in a state oſ compression. In the instant oſ fracture the particles at D and E are withheld by ſorces D d, E , and the- particles at A and E repel, resist, or support, vith forces a5 E .. Some line, such as d e A3, will limit all these ordinates, vhielv represent the forces actually exerted in the instant oſ ſracture. Iſ the ſorces are as the extensions and compressions, as ve have great reason to believe, d e A and A.: will be two straight lines They will form one struight line d A 3, iſ the ſorces which resist a certain dilãtation are equal to the ſorces which resist an equal compression. But this is quite accidental, and ĩs not strictly true in any body. Tn most hodies which have any eonsiderable ſirmness, the compressions made by any external ſorce are not so great as the dilatations which the same ſoree would produce; that is, the repulsions which are excited by any supposed degree of compression are greater than the attractions excited by the same degree oſ dilatation. Henee it will generally follow, that the angle d A D is less than the angle ? A 4, and the ordinates D q, E e, &e. are less than the corresponding ordinates A3, E,, &c. But whatever be the nature of the line d A 3, we are certain of this, that the whole area A D d is equal to the whole area A a3: ſor as the ſoree at B is gradually increased, and the ports between A and D are more extended, and greater cohesive ſorces are excited, there is ulvays such a degree of repulsive ſorces excited in the particles hetween A and A that the one set precisely haIances the other. The foree at B, acting perpendicularly 10 AB, has no tendency to push the whole piece closer on the part next the wall or to pull it away The sum oſ the attractive and repulsive ſorces actually excited must thereſore be equal. These sums are represented by the two triangular areas, which are therefore equal. The greater we suppose the repulsive forces corresponding to any degree of compression, in comparison with the ultractive ſorees corresponding to the same degree oſ. ex- tension, the smaller will A A be in comparison o?f AD. In a piece oſ cork or sponge, A A may chance to be equal to AD, or even to exceed it; but in a piece of marhle, A A will perhaps be very small in comparison of AD. 393. Nov it is evident that the repulsive forces excited between A and A have no share in preventing the ſraeturee. They rather contribute to it, by ſurnishing a ſulcrum to the lever, hy whose energy the cohesion oſ the particles in AD is overcome. Hence we see an important consequence of the compressibility of the hody. Its power of resisting this transverse strain is diminished by it, and so much the more diminished as the stufſf is more compressible. This is ſully verified by some very curious experiments made by Du Hamel. He took 16 hars of willow 2 ſeet long and  an inch square, and supporting them hy props under the ends, he broke them by weights hung on the middle He broke 4 of them by weights oſ 40, 41, 4T and 52 pounds: the mean is 45. He then cut 4 of them 3d through on the upper side, and filled up the cut with a thin piece oſ harder wood stuck in pretty tight. These were broken by 48, 54, 50, and 52 pounds; the mean of which is 51. He cut other ſour à through, and they were broken by 47, 49, 50, 46; the mean of which is 48. The remaining four were cul ds; and their mean strength vas 42. Another set oſ his experiments is still more remarkable. Six battens oſ willow, 36 inches long and Ij square, were broken by 525 pounds at a medium. Six hars were cut d through, and the cut filled with a wedge oſ hard wood stuek in with a little force: these broke with 551. Six bars were cut half through, and the cut was Bſlod in the same manner: they brok⸗ with 512. Six bars were cut ſths through; these hroke with 530- A hatten cut Jths through, and loaded till nearly broken, was unloaded, and the wedge taken out oſ the cut A thicker wedge was put in tight, so as to make the batten straight again by fſilling up the space leſt by the compression of the wood: this hatten broke with 577 pounds. From this it is plain that more than jds oſ the thickness (perhaps nearly ĩths) contrihuted nothing to the strength. The point A is the centre oſ ſracture in this case; and in order to estimate the strength oſ the piece, we may suppose that the crooked lever virtually concerned in the strain is DAB. We must find the point I, which is the centre oſ effort of all the attractive forces, or that point where the full cohesion of AD must be applied, so as to have a momentum equal to the accumulated momenta of all the variable forces. We must in like manner find the centre of effort ĩ oſ the repulsive or supporting ſorces exerted by the fibres lying between A and a. It is plain, and the remark is important, that this last centre of effort is the real fulerum oſ the lever, although A is the point where there is neither extension nor contraction; for the lever is supported in the same manner as if the repulsions oſ the whole line A A were exerted at that point. Thereſore let S represent the surface of ſracture ſrom A to D, and f represent the absolute cohesion of a ſibre at D in the instant oſ ſracture We shall have ſS xTæi=p, orl: I4iæVſfS: p; that is, the length AB is to the distance between the two centres of eſſort I and i, as the absolute eohesion of the section hetween A and D is to the relative strength of the section. It would be perhaps more accurate to make AI and Aĩ equal to the distances of A from the horizontal lines passing through the centres oſ gravity oſ the triangles d AD and ; AA, It is only in this construction that the points Iand i are ſhe centres oſ real eſſort oſ the accumulated attractions and repulsions. But I and i, determined as we have done, are the points where the ſull, equal, actions may be all applied, s0 as to produce the same moments. The final results are the same in both cases. The attentive and duly inſormed reader will see that Mr Bulfinger, in a very elaborate dissertation on the strength oſ heams in the Comment. Petropolitun. 1720, has committed several mistakes in his estimation oſ the actions of the ſibres. Wo mention this because his reasonings are quoted and appealed to as authorities by Muschenbroek and other authors of note. The subject has been considered hy many authors on the continent. We recommend to the reader's perusal the very minute discussions in the Memoirs of the Academy oſ Paris ſor 1702 by Varignon, the Memoirs for 1708 by Parent, and particularly that of Coulomb in the Mem. par les Sgęvans Etrangers, tom. vii. It is evident, ſrom what has been said above, that if S and s represent the surſaces oſ the sections above and helow A, and iſ G and g are the distances oſ their centres oſ gravity ſrom A, and O and o the distances oſ their centres oſ oscillation, and D and d their whole depths, the momentum oſ cohesion wil pe ſ5-0 GO +Leę⸗ æ ba- =pl If (as is most likely) the oreæ: are proportional to the extensions and compressions, the distanees AI and A à́ which are respectively Lu: and u are respectively =} DA, and ; AA; and when taken together are =; D A. Iſ, moregver, the extensions are equal to the compressions in the instant of ſracture, and the body is a rectangular prism like a common joist or heam, then DA and A A are also equal; and thereſore the momentum of cohesion is ſb x 3dx ; dæ Liæ =sſbdx ſ dæpl Hence we obtain this analogy, è Six times the length is to the depth as the ahsolute cohesion of the section is to its relative strength. 394. Thus we see that the compressibility of hodies has a very great inſluence on their power oſ withstanding a transverse strainn. We see that in the most favourable supposition oſ equal dilatations and compressions, the strength is reduced to one half of the value oſ what it would have been had the body been incompressible This is by no means obvious; ſor it does not readily appear how compressihility, which does not diminish the eohesion oſ a single fibre, should impair the strength oſ the whole. The reason, however, is suſficiently convincing when pointed out. In the instant oſ fracture a smaller portion of the section is actually exerting cohesive forces, while a part oſ it is only serving as a ſulerum to the lever, by whose means the strain on the section is produced. We see too that this diminution of strength does not so much depend on the sensible compressibility, as on its proportion to the dilatability by equal ſorcess. When this proportion is small, A A is small in comparison oſ AD, and a greater portion oſ the whole fibre is exerting attractive forcess The experiments already mentioned oſ Du Hamel de Monceau on hattens oſ willow, shew that its compressibility is nearly equal to iĩts dilatability. But the case is not very difſerent in tempered steel. The famous Harrison, in the delicate experiments which he made while occupied in making his longitude watch, discovered that a rod of tempered steel was nearly as much diminished in its length, as it was augmented by the same external ſoreee But it is not by any means certain that this is the proportion oſ dilatation and compression which obtains in the very instant of fracturee We rather imagine that it is not. The ſorces are nearly as the dilatations till very near breaking; but we think that they diminish when the body is just going to break. But it seems certain that the forces which resist compression increase ſaster than the compressions, even beſore ſracture. We know incontestably that the ultimate resistances to compression are insuperable by any force whieh we can employ. The repulsive ſorces thereſore (in their whole extent) increase ſaster than the compressions, and are expressed by an asymptotic branch of the Boseovichian curve ſormerly explained. It is thereſore probahle, especially in the more simple substances, that they increase ſaster, even in such compressions as ſrequently obtain in the breaking oſf hard bodiess We are disposed to think that this is always the case in such hodies as do not ſly oſſf in splinters on the concave side; but this must be understood with the exception oſ the permanent changes which may be made by compression, when the hodies are erippled by itt. This always increases the compression itselſ, and causes the neutral point to shiſt still more towards D. The efſect oſ this is sometimes very great and ſatal. Experiment alone ean help us to discover the proportion between the dilatahility and compressibility of hodies. The strain now under consideration seems the hest calculated ſor this research. Thus, iſ ve find that a piece oſ wood an inch square requires 12,000 pounds to tear it asunder by a direct pull, and that 200 pounds will break it trunsversely hy acting I0 inches ſfrom the section orf ſracture, we must conclude that the neutral point A is in the middle of the depth, and that the attractive and repulsive forces are equal. Any notions that we can ſform of the constitution oſ sueh fibrous hodies as timber, make us imagine that the sensible compressions, including what urises ſrom the bending up oſ the compressed fibres, is much greater thun the real corpuscular extensionss. One may get a general conviction oſ this unexpected proposition by reſlecting on what must happen during the ſracture An undulated fibre can only be drawn straight, and then the eorpuscular extension begins; but it may be bent up by compression to any degree, the corpuscular compression being little aſſected all the while This observation is very important; and though the forces of corpuscular repulsion may be almost insuperable by any compression that we can employ, a sensible compression may be produced by forces not enormous, sufficient to eripple the beam. Of this we shall see very important instances aſterwards. 395. It deserves to he noticed, that although the relative strength oſ a prismatic solid is extremely different in the three hypotheses now considered, yet the proportional strengths oſ different pieces follow the same ratio; namely, the direct ratio of the breadth, the direct ratio of the square oſ the depth, and the inverse ratio oſ the length. In the first hypothesis (of equal forces) the strength of a bd ; in the second (of attrac2] : : : : sbae tive forces proportional to the extensions) it was T and in the third (equal attractions and repulsions proporrectangular hbeam was | ,or tional to the extensions and compressions) it vas ba fba⸗ more generally vi where m expresses the unknown proportion between the attractions ànd repulsions corresponding to an equal extension and compression. 306. Hence we derive a piece oſ useſul information, which is confirmed by unexcepnted experience, that the strength oſ a piece depends chieſly on its depth, that is, on that dimension which is in the direction of the strain. A bar oſ timber of one inch in breadth and two inches in depth is four times as strong as a bar oſ only one inch deep, and it is twice as strong as a bar two inches broad and one deep; that is, a joist or lever is always strongest when laid on its edge. 397. There is thereſore a choice in the manner in which the cohesion is opposed to the strain, The general aim must be to put the centre oſ effort I as ſar from the ſulcrum or the neutral point A as possible, so as to give the greatest energy or momentum to the cohesion. Thus, if a triangular bar projecting from a wall is loaded with a weight at its extremity, it will bear thrice as much when one of the sides is uppermost as when it is undermost. The bar of Fig. 2. would be three times as strong iſ the side AB were uppermost and the edge DC undermost. 308. Hence it ſollows that the strongest joist that ean be cut out of a round tree is not the one which has the greatest quantity of timber in it, but such that the product of its breadth by the square oſ its depth shall be the greatest possiblee. Let ABCD (fig. 5.) be the section of this joist inseribed in the cirelee AB being the hreadth and AD the depth. Since it is a rectangular section, the diagonal BD is a diameter of the cirele, and BAD is a right angled trianglee Let BD be called a and BA be called æ;3 then AD is  V æ. Now we must have AB x AD, or x x a?xæè, or a' aæ, a maximum Its ſluxion ' æ3 æ æ must be made æ o, or ' æ3 x, or a  = 5 Iſ thereſore we make DE =3 DB, and drav EC perpendicular to BD, it will cut the circumſerence in the point C, which determines the depth BC and the breadth CD. Because BD: BC æ CD: CE, we have the area of the section BC-CD = BDCE. Thereſore the different sections having the same diagonal BD are proportional to their heights CE. Thereſore the seetion BCDA is less than the seetion B c D a, whose ſour sides are equal. The joist so shaped, therefore, is both stronger, lighter, and cheaper. 399. The strength of ABCD is to that oſ a Be D as 10,000 to 9166, and the weight and expence as 16,000 to 10,607; so that ABCD is preſerable to a Be D in the proportion oſ I0,607 to 9156, or nearly Ilb to 100. From the same principles it ſollows that a hollow tube is stronger than a solid rod containing the sume quantity of matter. Let Fig. 6. represent the section of a cylindric tube, of which AF and BE are the exterior and interior diameters and C the centree Drawv BD perpendicular to BC, and join DC. Then, because BD'  CD* CB, BD is the radius of a circle containing the same quantity oſ matter with the ring. IF we estimate the strength by the first hypothesis, it is evident that the strength oſ the tube will be to that oſ the solid cylinder, whose radius is BD, as BD? x AC to BD? x BD; that is, as AC to BD: ſor BD' expresses the cohesion oſ the ring or the circle, and AC and BD are equal to the distances oſ the centres oſ efſort (the sume with the centres of gravity) oſ the ring and circle ſrom the axis of ſracture. The proportion oſ these strengths will be diſſerent in the other hiypotheses, and is not easily expressed hy a general formula; hut in both it ĩs still more in ſavour of the ring or hollow tube. The ſollowing very simple solution will be readily understood hy the intelligent reader. Let O be the centre oſ oscillation oſ the exterior circle, o the centre oſ oscillation oſ the inner circle, and æ the centre of oscillation of the ring included between them. Let M be the quantity oſ surſace oſ the exterior circle, m that of the inner cirele, and æ that oſ the ring. i I nm 5 OC C: We have F u MFOmF e = ErCsæ, and fux F ] Iã , and the strength oſ the strength oſ the ring m the same quantity oſ matter in the form oſ a solid eylinder is ſæ x ; BD; s0 that the strength oſ the ring is to that oſ the solid rod oſ equal weight as F u to à BD, or nearly as FC to BD. This will easily appear by recolsum of p. rè leeting that POiIsm/ and that the momentum n. . fm FC Faſm Fo ; : of cohesion is 3FC = ſor the inner circle, &e. Emerson has given a very inaccurate approximation to this value in his Mechanics. 4to. 400. This property oſ hollow tubes is accompanied also with greater stiſſness; and the superiority in strength and stiſſess is so much the greater as the surrounding shell is thinner in proportion to its diameter. 401. Here we see the admirable wisdom oſ the author oſ nature in ſorming the bones oſ animal limbs hollow. The bones of the arms and legs have to perform the oſfice of levers, and are thus opposed to very great transverse strains. By this form they become incomparably stronger and stiſſer, and give more room ſor the insertion oſ muscles, while they are lighter and therefore more agile; and the same wisdom has made use oſ this hollow ſor other valuable purposes of the animal economy. In like manner, the quills in the wings oſ birds acquire by their thinness the very great strength which is necessary, vhile they are so light as to give suſficient buoyancy to the animal in the rare medium in which it must live and ſly about. The stalks oſ many plants, such as all the grasses, and many reeds, are in like manner hollow, and thus possess an extraordinary strength. Our best engineers now begin to imitate nature hy making many parts oſ their machines hollow, such as their axles oſ cast iron, &e.; and modern philosophical instrument makers now form the axes and ſramings of their great astronomical instruments in the same manner. In the supposition oſf homogeneous texture, it is plain that the ſracture happens as soon as the particles at D are separated beyond their utmost limit of cohesion. This is à determined quantity, and the piece bends till this degree oſ extension is produced in the outermost fibre. It follows that the smaller we suppose the distance between A and D, the greater will be the curvature which the beam will acquire beſore it breaks. Greater depth therefore makes a heam not only stronger but also stifferr. But iſ the parallel fibres can slide on each other, both the strength and the stifſness will be diminished. Thereſore iſ, instead oſ one beam D A XC, we suppose two, DABC and AA KB, not eohering, each oſ them will bend, and the extension oſ the fibres AB of the under heam will not hinder the compression oſ the adjoining fibres AB oſ the upper heam. 402. The two together thereſore will not be more than twice as strong as one oſ them (supposing DA = A à) instead oſ being ſour times as strong: and they will hend as much as either oſ them alone would bend by half the load. This may he prevented, if it were possible to unite the two beams aſl along the seam AB, so that the one shall not slide on the other. This may be done in small works, by gluing them together with a cement as strong as the natural lateral eohesion oſ the fibres. Iſ this cannot be done (as it cannot in large works), the sliding is prevented by socõL G the beams together; that is, by cutting down several rectangular notehes in the upper side oſ the lower beam, and making similar notches in the under side oſ the upper beam, and filling up the square spaces with pieces of very hard wood firmly driven in, as represented in Fig. . Some employ iron bolts by way oſ joggles. But when the joggle is much harder than the wood into which it is driven, it is very apt to work loose, by widening the hole into which it is lodged. The same thing is somelimes done by searfing the one upon the other, as represented in Fig. 8.; but this wastes more timber, and is not s0 strong, because the mutual I hooks which this method ſorms on each heam are very apt to tear each other up. By one or other oſ these methods, or something similar, may a compound heam be ſormed, of any depth, which will be almost as stiſſ and strong as an entire piece. 408. On the other hand, we may comhine strength with pliableness, by eomposing our heam oſ several thin planks laid on each other, till they make a proper depth, and leaving them at full liberty to slide on each other. It is in this manner that coach-springs are ſormed, as is represented in Fig. 9. In this assemblage there must be no joggles nor bolts oſ any kind put through the planks or plates: ſor this would hinder their mutual sliding. They must be kept together by straps which surround them, or by something equivalent. 404. The preceding observations show the propriety oſ some maxims of construction, which the artists have derived from long experience. Thus, if a mortice is to be cut out of a piee] which is exposed 1o a eross strain, it should be cut out ſrom that side which becomes concave by the strain, as in Fig. 10. but by no means as in Fig. ll. Iſ a pieee is to be strengthened by the addition of another, the added piece must be joined to the side which grows convex by the strain, as in Fig. 12. and IS. Before we go any farther, it will be convenient to recal the readers attention to the analogy between the strain on a beam projecting from a wall, and loaded at the extremity, and a beam supported at both ends and loaded in some intermediate point. It is sufficient on this occasion to read attentively what is delivered in our article on Roors We learn there that the strain on the middle point C Fig. 1I. of a rectangular beam AB, supported on props at A and B, is the same as if the part CA projected ſrom a wall, and were loaded with the halſ oſ the meight w susvoL. I. - rr pended at AA The momentum of the strain is thereſore 3 W x 3 AB, m Wx AB=p1, - The momentum of cohesion must he equal to this in every hypothesis. Having now considered in suſficient detail the cireumstances which afſect the strength of any section of a solid body that is strained transversely, it is necessary to take notice of some of the chieſ modifications of the strain itselſ. We shall consider only those that occur most ſrequently in our constructions. The strain depends on the external ſorce, and also on the lever by which it acts. A05. It is evidently of importance, that since the strain is exerted in any section by means of the cohesion of the parts intervening hetween the section under consideration and the point oſ application oſ the external force, the body must be able in all these intervening parts to propagate or excite the strain in the remote section. In every part it must be able to resist the strain excited in that part. It should thereſore be equally strong; and it is useless to have any part stronger, because the piece will nevertheless break where it is not stronger throughout; tand it is useless to make it stronger (relatively to its strain) in any part, ſor it will nevertheless equally ſail in the part that is too weak. Suppose then, in the ſirst place, that the strain arises from a weight suspended at one extremity, while the other end is firmly fixed in a wall. Supposing also the cross sections to be all rectangular, there are several ways oſ shaping the beam so that it shall be equally strong throughout. Thus it may be equally deep in every part, the upper and under surſaces being horizontal planes. The condition will be fulfilled by making all the horiontal sections triangles, as in Fig. 14. The two sides are vertical planes meeting in an edge at the extremity L. For the equation expressing the balance oſ srain and mtrength is  l =fſbd?. Thereſore since d? is the same throughout, and also n, we must have ſb =I, and h (the breadth AD oſ any. section ABCD) must be proportional to I (or AL), which it evidently is. Or, if the beam be oſ uniſform breadth, we must have aè everywhere proportional to I. This will be obtained by making the depths the ordinates oſ a common parabola, oſ which L is the vertex and the length is the axi; The upper or under side may be a straight line, as in Fig. 15. or the middle line may be straight, and then both upper and under surſaces will be curved. It is almost indiſferent what is the shape oſ the upper and under surſaces, provided the distances between them in every part be as the ordinates oſ a common parabola. Or, if the sections are all similar, such as circles, squares, or any other similar polygons, we must have d? or b proportional to I, and the depths or breadths must be as the ordinates of a cubical parahola. 406. It is evident that these are also the proper forms for a lever moveable round a fulerum, and acted on by a ſorce at the extremity. The force comes in the place of the weight suspended in the cases already considered; and as sueh levers always are connected with another arm, we readily see that both arms should be fashioned in the same manner. Thus in Fig. I4. the piece oſ timber may he supposed a kind of steelyard, moveable round æ horiZontal axis OP, in the ſront oſ the wall, and having the two weights P and æ in equilibrio The strain occasioned by each at the section in whieh the axis OP is placed must be the same, and each arm OL and O, must be equally strong in all its parts. The longitudinal sections of ench arm must he a triangle, a common parabola, or a cubic parabola, according to the conditions previously given. And, moreover, all these forms are equally strong: For any one of them is equally strong in all its parts, and they are all supposed to have the same section at the front of the wall or at the ſulorum. They are not, however, equully stif. The first, represented in Fig. I4. will bend least upon the whole, and the one formed by the cubie parabola will bend most. But their curvature at the very fulerum will be the same in all. It is also plain, that if the lever is of the second or third kind, that is, having the ſulorum at one extremity, ĩt must still be of the same shape; for in abstraot mechanies ĩt is indifferent which oſ the three points is considered as the axis oſf motion. In every lever the two ſorces at the extremities act in one direction, and the force in the middle acts in the opposite direction, and the great strain is always at that point. Thereſore a lever, such as Fig. 14. moveable round an axis passing horizontally through ,, and acting against an obstacle at OP, ãs equally able in all its purts to resist the strains excited in those parts. The same principles and the same construction will apply to beams, such as joists, supported at the ends L and  Fig. 14., und loaded at 3ome intermedinte part OP. This will appear evident by merely inverting the directions oſ the forces at these three points, or by reſerring to our article on Roors. 407. Hitherto we have supposed the external strainãng ſorce as acting only in one point of the beam. But it may be uniformly distributed all over the beam. To muke a beam in such circumstances equally strong in all its parts, the shape must be considerably difſerent ſrom the ſormer. 408. Thus suppose the beam to project ſrom a wall T it be oſ equal breadth throughout, its sides being verticul planes, purallel to each other and to the length, the vertical seetion in the direetion oſ its length must he a triangle instead oſ a common parabola; for the weight uniſormly distributed over the part lying beyond any se- tion, is as the length beyond that section: and since it may all be conceived as collected at its centre of gravity, which is the middle oſ that length, the lever by which this load acts or strains the section is also proportional to the same length. The strain on the section (or momentum oſ the load) is as the square oſ that length. The section must have strength in the same proportion. Its strength being as the breadth and the square oſ the depth, and the breadth heing constant, the square oſ the depth of any section must be as the square oſ its distance ſrom the end, and the depth must he as that distance; and thereſore the longitudinal vertical seetion must be a triangle. But iſ all the transverse sections are circles, squares, or any other similar figures, the strength oſ every section, or the cube oſ the diameter, must be as the square of the lengths beyond that section, or the square of its distancę ſrom the end; and the sides oſ the beam must be a semicubical parabola. If the upper and under surfaces are horiontal planes, ĩt is evident that the breadth must he as the square oſ the distance ſrom the end, and the horizontal sections may be formed by arches oſ the common parabola, having the length for their tangent at the vertex. By recurring to the analogy so oſten quoted hetween a projecting heam and a joist, we may determine the proper form of joists which are uniſormly loaded through their whole length. 409. This is a ſrequent and important case, being the oſfice oſ joists, raſters, &e. and there are some cireumstances which must be particularly noticed, because they are not s0 obvious, and have been misunderstoodc When a beam AB Fig. 16. is supported at the ends, and a weight is laid on any point P, a strain is excited in every part oſ the beam. The load on P causes the heam to press on A and B, and the props react with ſgrces equal and opposite to these pressures. The load at P is to the pressures at A and B as AB to PB and PA, and the pressures at A is to that at B as PB to PA; the beam therefore is in the same state, with respect to strain in every part oſ it. as if it were resting on a prop at P, and vere loaded at the ends with weights equal to the two pressures on the props; and observe, these pressures are such as will balance each other, being inversely as their distances from P. Let P represent the weight o load at P. The pressure on the prop P must be P x b This is thereſore the reaction oſ the prop B, and is the weight which we may suppose suspended at B, when we conceive the beam resting on a prop at P, and carrying the balancing weights at A and B. The strain occasioned at any other point C, by the load P at P, is the same with the strain at C, by the weight P P x hanging at B, when the beam rests on P, in thę manner now supposed; and it is the same iſ the beam, instead oſ being balanced on a prop at P, had its purt AP fixed in a wal. This is evident. Now we have shewn at length that the strain at C, hy the weight P x s hanging at B, is P x - x BC. We desire it to be particularly remarked that the pressure at A has no inſluence on the strain at C, arising from the action of any load between A and C; ſor it is indifſerent how the part AP oſ the projecting beam PB is supported. The weight at A just perſorms the same office with the wall in which we suppose the beam to be fixedd We are thus particular, because we have seen even persons not unaccustomed to discussions oſ this kind puææzled in their conceptions oſ this strain. Now let the load P be laid on some point ꝓ between C and P. The same reasoning shows us that the point is (with respect to strain) in the same state as if the beam were fixed in a wall, embracing the part » B, and a weight B . =P x Vii were hung on at A, and the strain at C is PB aB 410. In general, thereſore, the strain on any point C; arising from a load P laid on another point P, is proportional to the rectangle of the distances of P and C P x x AC. B from the ends nearest to each. It is P x E3a , P xſ PB æCcA. according as the load lies between C and A or between C and B. Cor. I. The strains which a load on any point P occasions on the points C, c, lying on the same side oſ P, are as the distances of these points ſrom the end B. In like manner the strains on E and e are as EA and e A. Cor. 2. The strain which a load occasions in the part on which it rests is as the rectangle oſ the parts on each side. Thus the strain occasioned at C by a load is to that at D by the same load as ACXCB to AD x DB. It is thereſore greatest in the middle. 411. Let us now consider the strain on any point C arising from a load uniformly distributed along the beam. Let AP be represented hy æ, and P» by æ, and the holè weight on the beam by . Then æ AB x x AB x æ Or r//7/9599595 //ſ7" 3 AC: AC⸗ Pres. on B by the whole wt. on AC = ac V B 5an: The weight on P is - - - u Pressure on B by the weight on Pp AC? x BC 2àB BC? x AC lIEEVIE Do. by the whole weight on AB æ a ACXBC 4 BCXAC, AC x BC x AC F CB AC x BC ?x3  J\58 Thus we see that the strain is proportional to the reetangle oſ the parts, in the same manner as Iſ the load a had been laid directly on the point C, and is indeed equal to one halſ of the strain which would be produced at C by the load a laid on there. 412. It was necessary to he thus particular, because we see in some elementary treatises oſ mechanics, published by authors of reputation, mistakes which are very plausible, and mislead the learner, It is there said, that the pressure at B ſrom a weight uniſormly diſfused along AB is the same as iſ it were collected at its centre oſ gravity, which would be the middle of AB; and then the strain ꝶt C is said to be this pressure at B multiplied by BC. But surely it is not diſficult to see the difſerence of these strains. It is plain that the pressure of gravity downwards on any point hetween the end A and the point C has no tendency to diminish the strain at C, arising ſrom the upward reaction oſ the prop B; whereas the pressure of gravity between C and B is almost in direct opposition to it, and must diminish it. We may however avoid the ſluxionary calculus with safety by the consideration of the centre oſ gravity, by supposing the weights oſr AC and BC to be collected at their respective centres oſ gravity; and the result of this computation will be the same as ahove; and we may use either method, although the weight is not uniformly distributed, provided only that ve know in what manner it is distributed. Strain at C by the weight on AC æ Strain at C by the weight on BC /a This investigation is evidently oſ importance in the practice oſ the engineer and architect, informing them what support is necessary in the diſferent purts oſ their constructions. We shall considler some cases oſ this kind in the article Roors. 413. It is now easy to ſorm a joist, so that it shall have the same relative strength in all iĩts parts. I. To make it equally able in all ils parts to carry a given weight laid on any point C taken at random, or uniſormly difſused over the whole length, the strength of the section at the point C must be as AC x CB. Therefore, I. If the sides are parallel vertical planes, the square of the depth (which ĩs the only variable dimension) or CD:, must be as AC x CB, and the depths must be ordinates oſ an ellipse. 2. Iſ the transverse sections are similar, we must make CD? as AC x CB. 3. Iſ the upper and under surſaces are parullel, the breadth must he as AC x CB. II. If the beam is necessarily londed at some given point C, and we would have the beam equally able in all its parts to resist the strain arising ſfrom the weight at C, we must make the strength oſ every transverse section between C and either end as its distance ſfrom that end. Thereſore, l. If the sides are parallel vertical planes, we must make CD?: EF? æ AC: AE. ; 2. Iſthe sections are similar, then CD?: EF? æ AC: AE. S. Iſ the upper and under surſaces are parallel, then, breadth at C: breadth at Eæ AC: AE. 414. The same principles enable us to determine the strain and strength oſ square or circular plates, oſ diſferent extent, but equal thickness This may be comprehended in this general proposition. Similar plates oſ equal thickness supported all round vill carry the same ahsolute weight, uniformly distri- buted, or resting on similar points, whatever is their èxtent. : Suppose two similar oblong plates oſ equal thickness, and let their lengths and breadths be L, I, and B, b Let their strength or momentum of cohesion he C, e, and the strains from the veights W, u, be S, s. Suppose the plates supported at the ends only, and resisting ſracture transversely. The strains, being as the weights and lengths, are as WL and u l, but their cohesion are as the breadths; and since they are of equal relative strength, ve have WL: u I=B: b, and VL , æ vl B and L: Iæu B: W: hut since they are oſ similar shapes L: =B: b, and thereſore u=W. The same reasoning holds again when they are also supported along the sides, and thereſore holds when they are supported all round (in which case the strength is doubleq). And iſ the plates are oſ any other figure, such as cireles or ellipses, we need only conceive similar rectangles inscribed in them. These are supported all round by the continuity oſ the plates, and therefore will sustain equal weights; and the same may be said oſ the segments which lie without them, because the strengths of any similar segments are equal, their lengths being as their breadths. Thereſore the thickness oſ the bottoms of vessels holding heavy liquors or grains should be as their diameters, and as the square root oſ their depths jointly. Also the weight which a square plate will bear is to that which a bar oſ the same matter and thickness will bear as twice the length of the bar to its hreadth. 415. There is yet another modification of the strain vhich tends to break a body transversely, which is of very frequent occurrence, and in some cases must be very carefully attended to, viæ. the strain arising ſrom its own weight. When a beam projects ſfrom a wall, every section is strained by the weight of all that projects beyond it. This may be considered as all collected at its centre oſ gravity. Thereſore the strain on any section is in the joint ratio oſ the weight oſ what projects beyond it, and the distance of its centre of gravity ſfrom the section. 416. The determination of this strain, and oſ the strength necessary ſor withstanding it, must be more complicated than the ſormer, because the ſform oſ the piece which results ſrom this adjustment oſ strain and strength influences the strain. The generul principle must evidently be, that the strength or momentum of cohesion oſ every section must be as the producet of the weight beyond it, multiplied by the distance oſ its centre of gravity. For example: Suppose the beam DLA Fig. I7. to project ſrom the wall, and that its sides are parallel vertical planes, so that the depth is the only variable dimensionn. Let LB =x2 and Bb =y. The element B b c C is = yà. Let G be the centre oſ gravity oſ the part lying without B, and g& be its distance ſrom the extremity L. Then xg is the arm of the lever by which the strain is excited in the section B b. Let B b or5 be as some power m of LB; mt1 that is, let v=aæm Then the contents of L Bb is The momentum of gravity round a horizontal axis at L is y x æ = amt15, and the whole momentum round the xm+Q . : axis is The distance oſ the centre oſ gravity ſrom m : L is had by dividing this momentum by the whole weight, nL And the m+2 distance oſ the centre oſ gravity from the section B b + which is - The quotient or g is m . xxm+1 xxm F2xml x is a na8 Eiauu ꝶ , = ẽ Thereſore the strain on the section Bò is had by multiplying u ux j xmt⸗ by &The product is——This must be as m+2 m+2 x nAl the square oſ the depth, or as y?. But y is as am, and * as xèm. Thereſore we have m +2æ2m, and m=m2; that is, the depth must be as the square oſ the distance ſrom the extremity, and the curve L bA is a parabola touching the horizontal line in L. 417. It is easy to see that a conoid formed by the rotation of this figure round DL will also be equally able in every section to bear its own weight. We need not prosecute this ſarther. When the figure oſ the piece is given, there is no difficulty in finding the strain; and the circumstance oſ equal strength to resist this strain is chieſly a matter oſ curiosity. 418. It is evident, ſrom what has been already said, that a projecting beam becomes less able to bear its own weight, as it projects ſartherr. Whatever may be the strength of the section DA, the length may be such that it will break by its own weight. If we suppose two heams A and B of the same substance and similar shapes, that is, having their lengths and diameters in the same proportion; and ſarther suppose that the shorter ean just bear its own weight; then the longer beam will not he able to do the same: For the strengths oſ the sections are as the cubes oſ the diameters, while the strains are as the biquadrates oſ the diameters; because the weights are as the cubes, and the levers by which these weights act in producing the strain are as the lengths or as the diameters. 419. These considerations show us, that in all cases where the strain is afſected by the weight oſ the parts oſ the machine or structure oſ any kind, the smaller bodies are more able to withstand it than the greater; and there seems to be bounds set by nature to the size ol machines constructed of any given material. Even when the weight oſ the parts oſ the machine is not taken into the account, we cannot enlarge them in the same proportion in all their parts. Thus a steam-engine cannot be doubled in all its parts, s0 as to be still efficient. The pressure on the piston is quadrupled. Iſ the liſt oſ the pump be also doubled in height while it is doubled in diameter, the load will be increased eight times, and will thereſore exceed the power. The depth of liſt, therefore, must remain unchanged; and in this oase the machine will be oſ the same relative strength as beſore, independent oſ ils own weightt. For the beam being doubled in all its dimensions, its momentum of cohesion is eight times greater, which is again a balance for a quadruple load acting by a double lever.But iſ we now consider the increase of the weight oſ the machine itselſ, which must be supported, and which must be put in motion by the intervention oſ its cohesion, we see that the large machine is weaker and less efficient than the small one. There is a similar limit set by nature to the size oſ plants and animals formed oſ the same matter. The cohesion oſ an herb could not support ĩt iſ it were increased to the size oſ a tree, nor could an oak support itselſ if 40 or 50 times bigger, nor could an animal oſ the make of a long- legged spider be increased to the size oſ a man; the articulations oſ ĩts legs could not support it. 420. Hence may be understood the prodigious superiority oſ the small animals both in strength and agility. A mmn by ſalling twice his own height may break his firmest boness A mouse may fall 20 times its height without risk; and even the tender mite or wood- louse may fall unhurt ſfrom the top of a steeplee But their greatest superiority is in respect oſ nimbleness and agility. A ſlea can leap above 500 times its own length, while the strength oſ the human muscles could not raise the trunk from the ground on limbs of the same construetion. The angular motions oſ small animals ſin which con- isists their nimbleness or agility) must be greater than those oſ large animals, supposing the force of the museular fibre to be the same in hoth. For supposing them similar, the number oſ equal fibres will be as the square of their linear dimensions; and the levers by which they act are as their linear dimensions The energy therefore oſ the moving force is as the cube of these dimensions. But the momentum oſ inertia, orſ re, is as the 4th power: Thereſore the angular velocity oſ the greater animals is smalle. The number oſ strokes which a ſly makes with its wings in a second is astonishingly great; yet, being voluntary, they are the eſſects oſ its agility. We have hitherto confined our attention to the simplest form in which this transverse strain can be produced. This was quite suſſicient for showing us the mechanism oſ nature by which the strain is resisted; and a very slight attention is sufficient for enabling us to reduce to this every other way in which the strain can be producedc. We shall not take up the readers time with the application oſ the same principles to other cases oſ this strain, but reſer him to the article Roors. In that article we have shown the analogy between the strain on the section of a beam projecting ſrom a wall and loaded at the extremity, and the strain on the same section of a heam simply resting on supports at the ends, and loaded at some intermediate point or points. The strain on the middle C of a beam AB Fig. I8. so supported, arising ſrom a weight laid on there, is the same with the strain which halſ that weight hanging at B would produce on the same section C iſ the other end oſ the beam were fixed in a wall. Iſ thereſore 1000 pounds hung on the end oſ a beam projeeting IO ſeet ſrom a wall will just break it at the wall, it will require 2000 pounds on its middle ſo break the same beam resting on two props I0 ſeet asunder. We have also shown in that artiole the additional strength which will be given to this beam by extending both ends beyond the props, and there ſraming it firmly into other pillars or supports. 421. We can hardly add any thing to what has been said in that article, except a few observations on the eſfects of the obliquity of the external forcee We have hitherto supposed it to act in the direction BP Fig. 4. perpendicular to the length of the beam. Suppose it to act in the direction BB, oblique to BA. In the article Roor we supposed the strain to be the same as iſ the force p acted at the distance AB, but still perpendicular to AB: so it is. But the strength oſ the seetion A A is not the same in both cases; for by the obliquity of the action the piece DCKA is pressed to the other. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the corpuscular forces to say precisely what will be the efſect oſ the pressure arising ſrom this obliquity; but we can clearly see, in general, that the point A, which in the instant oſ fracture is neither stretched nor compressed, must now be farther up, or nearer to D; and therefore the number of particles which are exerting cohesive forces is smaller, and therefore the strength is diminished. Therefore, when we endeavour to proportion the strength oſ a beam to the strain arising from an external ſorce acting obliquely, we make too liberal allowance by increasing this external force in the ratio of AB to AB. We acknowledge our inability to assign the proper correction. But this circumstance is oſ very great inſluencee In many machines, and many framings oſ carpentry, this oblique action of the straining ſorce is unavoidable; and the most enormous strains to which materials are exposed are generally oſ this kind. In the frames set up for carrying the ringstones of arches, it is hardly possible to avoid them: ſor ualthough the judicious engineer disposes his beams so as  to sustain only pressures in the direction oſ their lengths, tending either to crush them or to tear them asunder, it ſrequently happens that, by the setiling of the work, the pieces come to eheck and bear on each other transversely, tending to break each other acrosss This we have remarked upon in the article Roors, with respeet to a truss by Mr Price. Now when a eross strain is thus combined with an enormous pressure in the direction of the length of the heam, it is in the utmost danger oſ snapping suddenly across This is one great cause oſ the carrying away oſ masts. They are compressed in the direction oſ their length by the united force oſ the shrouds, and in this state the transverse aetion of the wind soon eompletes the ſracture. 429. When considering the compressing strains to which materials are exposed, we deſerred the discussion of the strain on eolumns, observing that it was not, in the cases which usually occur, a simple compression, but was combined with a transverse strain, arising ſrom the bending oſ the column. When the column ACB Fig. 19. resting on the ground at B, and loaded at top with a veight A, acting in the vertieal direction AB, is bent into a curve ACB, so that the tangent at C is perpendicular to the horizon, its condition somewhat resembles that oſ a beam firmly fixed between B and C, and strongly pulled by the end A, s0 as to bend it between C and A. Although we cannot conceive how a force aeting on a straight column AB in the direction AB can bend it, we may suppose that the force acted ſirst in the horizontal direetion A b, till it was bent to this degree, and that the rope was then gradually removed ſrom the direetion Ab to the direction AB, inereasing the foree as mueh as is necessary ſor preserving the same quantity of ſlexure. 423. The first author (we believe) who eonsidered this important subject with serupulous attention was the celebrated Euler, who published, in the Berlin Memoirs for 1757, his Theory of the Strength oſ Columns. The general proposition established by this theory is, that the strength oſ prismatical columns is in the direet quadruplicate ratio oſ their diameters, and the inverse duplicate ratio of their lengthss. He prosecuted this subject in the Petersburgh Commentaries for 1778, confirming his former theory. We do not find that any other author has bestowed much attention on it, all seeming to acquiesce in the determinations oſ Euler, and to consider the subject as oſ very great diſficulty, requiring the application oſ the most refmed mathematies. Muschenbroek has eompared the theory with experiment: but the comparison has heen very unsatisſactory, the difference from the theory being so enormous as to afford no argument for its justnesss. But the experiments do not contradict it, ſor they are so anomalous as to afſord no conclusion or general rule whatever. To say the truth, the theory can be considered in no other light than as a specimen of ingenious and very artful algebraic analysiss Euler was unquestionably the first anulyst in Europe ſor resouree and address He knew this, and enjoyed his superiority, and without seruple audmitted any physical assumptions which gave him an opportunity of displaying his skil. The inconsistency of his assumptions with the known laws of mechanism gave him no concern; and when his algebraic processes led him to any conclusion which would make his renders stare, being eontrary to all our usual notions, he frankly owned the puradox, but went on in his analysis, saying, s Ned analysi magis fidendum Mr Robins has given some very risible instances oſ this confidence in his anolysis. Nuy, so fond was he of this kind of amusement, that, aſter having published an untenable Theory oſ Light and Colours, he published several memoirs, explaining the aberration of the heavenly bodies, and deducing some very wonderſul consequences, fully confirmed by experience, ſrom the Newtonian principles, which were oppovoL. I. 2o site and totally inconsistent with his own theory, merely because the Newtonian theory gave him  occasionem analyseos promovendæa We are thus severe in our ohservations, because his theory of the strength of columns is one of the strongest instances oſ this wanton kind oſ proceeding, and because his ſollowers in the Academy oſf St Petersburgh, such as Mr Fuss, Lexell, and others, adopt his conclusions, and merely echo his wordss. We are not a little surprised to see Mr Emerson, a considerable mathematician, and a man oſ very independent spirit, hastily adopting the same theory, oſ which we doubt not but our readers will easily see the ſalsity. Euler considers the column ACB Fig. 19. as in a condition precisely similar to that oſ an elastic rod bent into the curve by a cord AB connecting its extremities In this he is not mistaken. But he then draws CD perpendicular to AB, and considers the strain on the section C as equal to the momentum or mechanical energy of the weight A acting in the direction DB upon the lever æ c D, moveable round the fulerum c, and tending to tear asunder the particles which cohore along the section c C.. This is the same principle (as Euler admits) employed by James Bernoulli in his investigation of the elastic curve ACB. Euler considers the strain on the section c  as the same with what it would sustain if the same power acted in the horiZzontal direction EF on a point E as ſar removed ſrom C as the point D is We have reasoned in the same manner (as has been observed) in the article Roors, where the obliquity of action was inconsiderablee. But in the present case, this substitution leads to the greatest mistakes, and has rendered the whole oſ this theory ſalse and useless. It would he just if the column were oſ materials which are incompressible But it is evident, from what has been said above, that by the compression oſ the parts the real fulerum of the lever shiſts away from the point c, 50 much the more as the compression is greater. In the great compressiona oſ Ionded columns, and the almost unmeasurable compressions of the truss beams in the centres oſ bridges, and other cases of chieſ importance, the fulerum is shiſted far over towards æ, s50 that very few fibres resist the ſracture by their cohesion; and these ſew have a very feeble energy or momentum, on account of the short arm oſ the lever by which they act. This is a most important consideration in carpentry, yet it makes no element oſ Euler's theory The consequence of this is, that a very small degree oſ curvature is suſficient to cause the column or strutt to snap in an instant, as is well known to every experienced carpenterr. The experiment by Muschenbroek, which Euler makes use of in order to obtain a measure oſ strength in a particular instance, ſfrom which he might deduce all others by his theorem, is an incontestible prooſ of thiss The ſforce which broke the column is not the twentieth part oſ what is necessary for breaking it by acting at E in the direction EF. Euler takes no notice of this immense discrepancy, because it must have caused him to abandon the speculation with which he was then amusing himselſ. 424. We cannot find room at present to enter minutely upon the reſutation of this theory; but we can easily show its uselessness, by its total inconsisteney with common ohservation. It results legitimately ſrom this theory, that if CD have no magnitude, the weight A can have no momentum, and the column cannot be broken. True, it cannot be broken in this way, snapped by a transverse ſracture, if it do not bend; but we know very well that it can be crushed or crippled, and we see this ſrequently happen. This circumstance or event does not enter into Eulers investigation, and therefore the theory is imperſect at least, and useless. Had this crippling been introduced in the ſorm of a physical assumption, every topic oſ reasoning employed in the process must have been laid aside, as the intelligent reader will easily se- But the theory is not only imperfeot, but ſalse. The ordinery reader will be convinced oſ this by another legitimate consequence oſ it. Fig. 20. is the same ith Fig. 106. oſ Emerson's Mechanics, where this subjeet is treated on Euler's principles, and represents a erooked piece oſ matter resting on the ground at F, and loaded at A with a weight acting in the vertieal direetion AF. It results from Euler's theory that the strains at b, B, D, E, &e. are as bo, BC, DI, EK, &. Thereſore the strains at G and H are nothing; and this is asserted by Emerson and Euler as a serious truth; and the piece may be thinned od infinitum in these two places, or even cut through, without any diminution of its strength. The absurdity oſ this assertion strikes at first hearing. Euler nsserts the same thing with respect to a point oſ contrary flexure. Farther discussion is, ve apprehend, neediess. 425. This theory must thereſore be given up. Yet these dissertations of Euler in the Petersburgh Commentaries deserve a perusal, both as very ingenious specimens oſ analysis, and because they contain maxims of practice which are important. Although they give an erroneous measure oſ the compurative strength of columms, they show the immense importance oſ preventing all bendings, and point out with accuracy where the tendencies to bend are greatest, and how this may he prevented by very small ſorces, and what a prodigious accession of force this gives the column. There is a valuable paper in the same volume by Fuss on the Strains on framed Carpentry, which may also be read with advantage. 426. It will now be asked, what shall be substituted in place oſ this erroneous theory ? What is the true proportion oſ the strength of columms? We acknowledge our inability to give a satisfactory answer. Such ean be ohtained only by a previous knowledge oſ the proportion between the extensions and compressions produced by equal forees, by the knowledge oſ the absolute compres- sions producible by a given ſorce, and by a knowledge oſ the degree oſ that derangement oſ parts which is termed crippling These eircumstances are but imperſeetly Enown to us, ani there lies beſore us a wide ſield oſ experimental inquiry. Fortunately the ſoree requisite for crippling a beam is prodigious, and a very small lateral support is sufficient to prevent that hending which puts the beam in imminent danger. A judicious engineer will always employ transverse bridles, as they are called, to stay the middle oſ long beams, which are employed as pillars, strutts, or truss beams, and are exposed, by their position, to enormous pressures in the direction of their lengths. Such stays may be observed, disposed with great judgment and economy, in the centres employed by Mr Perronet in the erection oſ his great stone arches. He was obliged to correet this omission made by his ingenious predecessor in the heautiſul centres oſ the bridge of Orleans, which we have no hesitation in affirming to be the finest piece oſ carpentry in the world. It only remains on this head to compare these theoretical deducetions with experiment. 427. Experiments on the transverse strength oſ hodies are easily made, and accordingly are very numerous, especially those made on timber, which is the case most common and most interestingg But in this great number oſ experiments there are very ſew ſrom which we can draw much practical inſormationn. The experiments have in general been made on such small scantſings, that the unavoidable natural inequalities hear too great a proportion to the strength oſ the whole piecee Accordingly, when we compare the experiments oſ diſſerent authors, we find them differ enormously, and even the experiments by the same author are very anomalous The completest series that we have yet seen is that detailed by Belidor in his Science des Inugenieurs. They aro contained in the ſfollowing tablee. The pieces were sound, even-grained oak. The column b contains the breadths of the pieces in inches; the column d contains their depths; the column I contains their lengths; column ꝑ» contains the weights (in pounds) which broke them when hung on their middles; and m is the column of averages or mediums. 428. By comparing Experiments Ist and Sd, the itrength appears proportional to the breadth. Experiments Sd and 4th shew the strength proportional to the square of the depth. Experiments lst and 5th shew the strength nearly in the inverse proportion oſ the lengths, but with a sensible deficiency in the longer pieces. Experiments 5th and 7th shew the strengths proportional to the breadths, and the square oſ the depth. Experiments lst and 7th shew the same thing, compounded with the inverse proportion of the length: the deficiency relative to the length is not s0 remarkahle here. Experiments Ist and 2d, and experiments 5th and 6th, shew the increase of strength, by fastening the ends, to be in the proportion of 2 to S The theory gives the proportion of 2 to 4. But a diſference in the manner of fixing may produce this deviation ſrom the theory, which only supposed them to be held down at places beyond the props, as when a joist is held in the walls, and also rests on two pillars between the walls. (See what is said on this subject under the article Roor.) The chieſ source oſ irregularity in such experiments is the fibrous, or rather plated texture oſ timber. It consists oſ annual additions, whose cohesion with each other is vastly weaker than that oſ their own fibres. Let Fig. 2Ll. represent the section of a tree, and ABCD, ao b c d the section oſ two battens that are to be cut out oſ it ſor experiment, and let AD and o d be the depths, and DC, d c the breadthss The batten ABCD will be the strongest, for the same reason that an assemblage oſ planks set edgewise will ſorm a stronger joist than planks laid above each other like the plates oſ a coach-spring Mr Buſſon ſound by many trials that the strength of ABCD was to that of a b c d (in oak) nearly as 8 to . The authors of the different experiments were not careſul that their battens had their plates all disposed similarly with respect to the strain. But even with this precautivn they would not have afforded sure grounds oſ compuiation for large works; for great beams occupy much, if not the whole, oſ the section of the tree; and ſrom this it has happened that their strength is less than in proportion to that oſ a small lath or batten. In short, we can trust no experiments but such as have been made on large beams. These must be very rare, for they are most expensive and laborious, and exceed the abilities of most oſ those who are disposed to study this matter. But we are not wholly without such authority. Mr Buſſon and Mr Du Hamel, two oſ the ſirst philosophers and mechanicians oſf the age, were directed by government to make experiments on this subject, and were supplied with ample funds and apparatus. The relation of their experiments is 1o be ſound in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1740, 1741, 1748, 1768; as also in Du Hameſs valuable perſormances sur I Exploitotion des Arbres, et sur la Conservation et le Transport de Bois. Ve earnestly recommend these dissertations to the perusal of our readers, as containing much useful information relative to the strength of timber, and the hest methods of employing it. We shall here give an abstract of Mr Buſfons experiments. 420. He relates a great numher which he had prosecuted during two years on small battens. He found that the odds oſ a single layer, or part of a layer, more or Iess, or even a different disposition oſ them, had such influence that he was obliged to abandon this method, ani to have recourse to the largest beams that he was able to break. The ſollowing table exhibits one series oſ experiments on bars oſ sound oak, clear of knots, and four inches square. This is a specimen of all the rest. Column Ist is the length oſ the bar in feet clear hetween the supjorts. Column 2d is the weight oſ the bar (the second day aſter it was ſelled) in pounds Two bars were tried oſ each length. Eoch oſ the first three pairs consisted oſ two cuts oſ the same tree The one next the root was always ſound the heaviest, stiſſest, and strongest. Indeed Mr Bufſon says that this was invariably true, that the heaviest was always the strongest; and he recommends it as a certain or sure rule ſor the choice oſ timber. He finds that this is always the case when the timber has grown vigorously, ſorming very thick annual layers. But he also observes that this is only during the advances oſ the tree to maturity; ſor the strength oſ the different circles approaches gradually to equality during the tree's healthy growth, and then it decays in these poris in a contrary order. Our toolmakers assert the same thing with respect to beech: yet a eontrary opinion js very prevalent; and wood with a fine, that is, a small grain, is ſrequently preſerredlc Perhaps no person has ever made the trial with such minuteness as Mr Buſſon, and we think that much deference is due to his opinion. Column Sd is the number oſ pounds necessary ſor breaking the treo in the course of a ſew minutes. Column 4th is the inches which it bent down beſore breaking. Column 5th is the time at which it broke. seasoning; and thereſore, in order to secure uniſormity, his trees were all felled in the same season oſ the year, were squared the day aſter, and tried the third day. Trying them in this green state gave him an opportunity oſ observing a very curious and unaccountable phenomenon. When the weights were laid briskly on, nearly suſficient to break the log, a very sensible smokè was observed to issue ſrom the two ends with a sharp hissing noise. This continued all the while the tree was bending and cracking. This shows that the log is affected or strained through its whole length; indeed this must be inferred from its bending through its whole length. It also shows us the great efſects oſ the compression. It is a pity Mæ Buffon did not take notice whether this smoke issued from the upper or compressed half oſ the section only, or whether it came ſrom the whole. 430. We must now make some ohservations on thesæ experiments, in order to compare them with the theory which we have endeavoured to establish. Mr Buffon considers the experiments with the 5 inch bars as the standard of comparison, having both extended these to greater lengths, and having tried more pieces oſ each length. Our theory determines the relative strength oſ bars oſ the same section to be inversely as their lengthss But ũiſ we exeept the five experiments in the first column) we find a very great deviation from this rulee. Thus the 5-inch bar oſ 28 feet long should have half the strength of that oſ I4 feet, or 2650; whereas it is but 1775. The bar oſ I4 ſeet should have halſ the strength oſ that of 7 ſeet, or 5762; whereas it is but 5800. In like manner, the fourth oſ 11525 is 2551; but the real strength of the 28 feet bar is 1775. We have added a column A, which exhibits the strength which each of the 5-inch bars ought to have by the theory. This deviation is most distinctly sæen in Fig. 22. where BK is the scale oſ lengths, B being at the point 7 oſ the scale and K at 28. The ordinate CB is = 11525, and the other ordinates DE, GE, &e. are respectively = Le The lines DV, GH, &e. are made = 4350, 1775, &e. expressing the strengths given by experiment. The IO feet bar and the 24 feet bar are remarkably anomalous But all are deficient, and the deſect has an evident progression from the first to the last. The same thing may be shown of the other columns, and even oſ the first, though it is very small in that column. It may also be observed in the experiments of Belidor, and in all that we have seenn. We cannot doubt therefore oſ its being a law oſ nature, depending on the true principles oſ cohesion, and the laws oſ mechanies. But it is very puzæling, and we cannot pretend to give a satisſactory explanation of the diffieulty. The only eſſeet which we can coneeive the length of a beam to have, is to increase the strain at the seetion oſ fracture by employing the intervening beam as a lever. But we do not distinetly see what change this ean produce in the modo of action of the fibres in this section, so as either to change their cohesion or the place oſ its centre oſ efſort: yet something oſ this kind must happen. We see indeed some circumstances which must eontribute to make a smaller weight sufficient, in Mr Buſfons experiments, to break a long beam than in the exact inverse proportion oſ its length. In the first place, the weight of the beam itselſ augments the strain as mueh as if halſ oſ it were added in the form oſ a weightt. Mr Buſfon has given the weights oſ every beam on which he made experiments, which is very nearly 74 pounds per cubic foot. But they are much too small to account ſor the deviation ſfrom the theory. The halſ weights of the 5-ineh heams of 7, 14, and 28 ſeet length are only 45, 92, and I62 pounds; which makes the real strains in the experiments 11560, 5390, and 1956; which are ſar from having the proportions oſ 4, 2, and I. i Buffon says that healthy trees are universally strongest at the root end; thereſore when we use a longer beam, its middle point, where it is broken in the experiment, is in a weaker part oſ the tree But the trials of the 4-inch beams show that the difſference from this cause is almost insensible. ſThe length must have some mechanieal inſluence which the theory we have adopted has not yet explained. It may not however be inadequate to the task. The very ingenious investigation oſ the elastic curve, by James Bernoulli and other celebrated mathematicians, is perhaps as refined an application oſ mathematical analysis as we Inow. Yet in this investigation it was necessary, in order to avoid almost insuperable diſficulties, to take the rimplest possible case, viẽ. where the thickness is exeeedingly small in comparison with the length. If the thickness be considerable, the quantities negleeted in the caloulus are too great to permit the eonclusion to he accurate, or very nearly s00. Without heing able to define the form into which an elastic body of considerable thickness will be bent, we can say with confidence, that in an extreme case, where the compression in the concave side is very great, the curvature difſers considerably ſrom the Bernoullian curve. But, as our investigation is incomplete and very long, we do not ofſer it to the reader. 4381. The ſollowing more familiar considerations will, we apprehend, render it highly probable that the relative strength oſ beams decreases ſaster than in the inverse ratio oſ their length. The curious observation by Mr Buſſon oſf the vapour which issued with a hissing noise ſrom the ends oſ a heam oſ green oak, while it was hreaking by the load on its middle, shows that the whole length of the pioce was aſſected: indeed it must be, since it is bent throughout. We have shown above, that a certain definite eurvature oſ a heam of a given ſorm is alvays aecompanied by rupturee. Now suppose the heam A oſf 10 ſeet long, and the beam B of 20 feet long, bent to the same degree, at the place oſ their fixture in the wall; the weight which hangs on A is nearly double oſ that which must hang on B. The ſorm oſ any portion, suppose 5 feet, oſ these two beams, immediately adjoining to the wall, is considerably different. At the distance oſ 5 feet the curvature of A is  oſ its curvature at the wal. The curvature oſ B in the corresponding point is ĩths oſ the same curvature at the wal. Through the whole of the intermediate b ſeet, thereſore, the curvature oſ B is greater than that of A This must make it weaker throughout. It must occasion the fibres to slide more on each other (that it may acquire this greater curvature), and thus aſſect their lateral union; and thereſore those which are stronger ill not assist their weaker neighbours. To this we must add, that in the shorter beams the ſorce with which the fibres are pressed laterally on each other is douhle. This must impede the mutual sliding of the fibres which we mentioned a little ago; nay, this lateral compression may change the law of longitudinal cohesion (as will readily appear to the reader who is acquainted with Boscovich's doctrines), and increase the strength oſ the very surſace of ſracture, in the same way, however inexplicable, as it does in metals when they are hammered or drawn into wire. The reader must judge how ſar these remarks are worthy oſ his attention. The engineer will careſully keep in mind the important fact, that a beam of quadruple length, instead of having ;th oſ the strength, has only about th; and the philosopher should endeavour to discover the cause oſ this diminution, that he may give the artist a more aceurate rule oſ computation. 432. Our ignorance of the law by which the cohesion oſ the particles changes by a change oſ distance, hinders us from discovering the precise relation between the curvature and the momentum of cohesion; and all we can do is to multiply experiments, upon which we may establish some empirical rules ſor caleulating the strength oſ solids. Those from which we must reason at present are too few and too anomalous to be the foundation of such an empirical ſormula. We may, however, ohserve, that Mr Buſfon's experiments give us considerable assistance in this particular: For iſ to each of the numbers oſ the column for the 5-inch beams, corrected by adding half the weight oſ the beam, we add the constant number 1245, we shall have a set oſ numbers which are very nearly reciprocals oſ the lengths. Let 1245 be called e, and let the weight which is known by experiment to be necessary for breaking the 5inch beam oſ the length a be called . We shall have P*exs 2c =p. Thus the weight necessary ſor breaking the 7-foot bar is 11560. This added to 1245, and the sum multiplied by 7, gives Pc xa m 89635. Let I be I8; then Bn 1245  37ẽ5, æ), which difſers not more than v ſrom what experiment gives uss. This rule holds equally well in all the other lengths except the 10 and 24 ſoot beams, which are very unomalous. Such a ſormula is abundantly exact ſor practice, and will answer through a much greater variety oſ length, though it cannot be admitted as a true one; because, in a certain very great length, the strength will be nothing. For other sizes the constant number must change in the proportion of dẽ, or perhaps of ꝑ. 483. The next comparison which we have to make with the theory is the relation between the strength and the square oſ the depth oſ the section. This is made by compuring with each other the numbers in any horizontul line oſ the tablee In making this comporison we find the numbers of the 5inch bars uniformly greater than the rest. We imagine that there is something peculiar to these bars: They are in general heavier than in the proportion oſ their seetion, but not 5o much as to account for all their superiority. We imagine that this set oſ experiments, intended as a standard for the rest, has been made at one time, and that the season has had a consideruble influence. The ſuct however ĩs, that if this column be kept out, or the numbers which represent the strengths be uniſormly diminished about ſ,th, the different sizes will deviate very little from the ratio of the square oſf the depth, as determined by theory. There is, however, a small deficieney in the larger beams. VWe have been thus anxious in the examination oſ these experiments, because they are the only ones which have been related in suſficient detail, and made on a proper scale for giving us data ſrom which we can deduce conſidential maxims for practicee They are s0 troublesome and expensive that we have little hopes oſ seeing their number greatly inereased; yet surely our navy board would do an unspeakable service to the publie by appropriating a ſund for such experiments under the management oſ some man of science. 4384. There remuains another comparison, which ĩs oſ ehieſ importance, namely, the proportion between the ansoLuTE conEION and the RnELATIVE s7RENGTH. It may be guessed, from the very nature of the thing, that this must be very uncertain. Experiments on the absolute strength must be confined to very small pieces, by reason of the very great forces which are required for tearing them asunder. The values therefore deduced from them must be subject to grent inequalities. Unſortunately we have got no detail oſ any experiments; all that we have to depend on is two passages of Muschenbroeks Essais de Physique; in one oſ which he says, that a piece oſ sound oak '5ths oſ an inch square is torn asunder hy 1I50 pounds; and in the other, that an oak plank I2 inches hroad and I thick will just suspend I89, 163 pounds. These give for the cohiesion of an inch square 15, 755 and 15,763 pounds. Bouguer, in his Traũe du Nevire, says, ihat it is very well Enown that a rod oſ sound oak àth of an inch square vill be torn asander hy 1000 pounds. This gives 16,000 ſor the cohesion oſ a square inch. We shall take this as a round number, easily used in our computations. Let us eompure this with Mr Bufſon's trials oſ huams ſour inches square. The absolute eohesion oſ this section is 16,000 x 16 æ 256,000. Did every fibre exert its whole force in the instant oſ ſracture, the momentum oſ cohesion wouldã he the same as if it had all acted at the centre oſ gravity oſ the section at 2 inches ſrom the axis oſ ſracture, and is therefore 512,000. The 4-ineh beam, T ſeet long, was broken by 5312 pounds hung on its middlee The half of this, or 2656 pounds, would have broken ĩt, if suspended at ils extremity, projecting 31 ſeet or 42 inches from a wall. The momentum of this strain Is thereſore 2656 x 42, æ 11552. Now this is in equilibrio with the actual momentum oſ eohesion, which is thereſore T11552 instend o? 512000. The strength is thereſore diminished in the proportion of 512000 to I11552, or very nearly oſ 459 to 1. As ve are quite uncertain as to the place oſ the centre oſ eſſort, it is needless to consider the ſull cohesion as octing at the centre oſ gravity, and producing the momentum 512,000; and we may converſ the whole into a simple multiplier m of the length, and say, as m times the length ũs io the depth, so is the absolute cohesion of the section to the rilalive strength. Thereſore let the absolute cohesion oſa square inch be called ſ, the breadth B, the depth 4, and the length I (all in Inches), the relative strength, or ſhe  VOL. I. i Lu ſorce , which balances it, is , or in round fba⸗ 9,051 e. numbers I ; form  2 x 4,59. This great diminution of strength cannot be wholly accounted for by the inequality oſ the cohesive forces exerted in the instant oſ ſracture; for in this case we know that the centre oſ effſort is at one third oſ the height in a rectangular section (hecause the forees really exerted are as the extensions oſ the ſibres)) The relative strength ſba⸗ : would be , and ꝓ would have been 5127 instead 3 oſ 2656. We must ascribe this diminution (which ĩs three times greater than that produced by the inequality of the cohesive ſorces) to the compression of the under part of the beam; and we must endeavour to explain in vhat manner this compression produces an efſect which seems so little explicable by such means. As we have repeatedly observed, it ĩs a matter oſ nearly universal experience that the ſorces actually exerted by the particles oſ bodies, when stretched or compressed, are very nearly in the proportion of the distances to which the particles are drawn ſrom their natural positions. Now, although we are eertain that, in enormous compressions, the ſorces increase ſaster than in this proportion, this makes no sensible change in the present question, because the body is broken beſore the compressions have gone so ſar; nay, we imagine that the compressed parts are crippled in most cases even beſore the extended parts are torn asunder. Muschenbroek asserts this with great confidence with respect to oak, on the authority oſ his own experiments. He says, that although oak will suspend half as much again as fir, it will not support, ãs a pillar, two-thirds oſ the load which fir will support in that form. We imagine thereſore that the mechanism in the present case is nearly as follows: Let the beam DCK A (fig. 23.) be loaded at its extremity with the weight P, acting in the direction KP, perpendieular to DC. Let D a4 be the section oſ ſracture. Let DA be ahout ĩd oſ DA. A will be the particle or fibre which is neither extended or compressed. Make A: Dd æ DA: Aà. The triangles DA d, a Aj, will represent the accumulated attracting and repelling forces. Make AI and Ai æ}d DA and,d AA. The point I will be that to which the ſull cohesion D d or f oſ the partieles in AD must be applied, so as to produee the same momentum which the variable forces at I, D, &e. really produce at their several points of application. In like manner,  is the centre oſ similar effort oſ the repulsive forces excited by the compression between A and 4, and it is the real fulerum of a benũed lever. Ii&, by which the whole effect is produced. The eſſect is the same as if the full cohesion oſ the stretched fibres in AD were accumulated in I, and the ſull repulsion of all the compressed fibres in AA were accumulated in i. The ſorces which are balanced in the operation are the weight P, acting by the arm ki, and the full cohesion of AD acting by the arm Ii The forces exerted by the compressed fibres between A and A only serve to give support to the lever, that it may exert its strain. We imagine that this does not difſer much ſrom the real procedure of naturee The position of the point A may he different ſrom what we have deduced from Mr Buſfons experiments, compared with Muschenbroek's value oſ the ahsolute cohesion oſ a square inch. Iſ this last should be only I2000, DA must be greater than we have here made it, in the proportion of 12000 to 16000. For Ii must stĩl be made = d A 4, supposing the forces to be proportional to the extensions and compressions. There can he no doubt that a part only oſ the cohesion oſf D A operates in resisting the ſracture in all substances which have any compressibility; and it is confirmed by the experiments of Mr DuHamel on willow, snd the inſerences are by no means confined to that species oſ timberr. We say, thereſore, that when the beam is broken, the eohesion oſ AD alone is exerted, and that each ſibre exerts a ſorce proportional to its extension: und the accumulated momentum is the same as iſ the full cohesion oſ AD were acting hy the lever Ii = Jd of DA. It may be said, that iſ only jd oſ the eohesion oſ oak be exerted, it may be cut jds through without weakening it. But this cannot be, because the cohesion oſ the whole is employed in preventing the lateral slide o oſten mentioned. We have no experiments to determine thai it may not be cut through ;d without loss of its strength. This must not be considered as a subject oſ mere speculative euriosity: It is intimately conneeted with all the practical uses which we ean make oſ this knowledge; for it is almost the only way that we ean learn the compresnibility oſ timber. Experiments on the direct cohesion are indeed diſficult, and exceedingly expensive iſ we attempt them in large pieces. But experiments on compression are almost impracticable The most instructive experiments would he, first to establish, by a great number of trials, the transverse ſorce of a modern hatten; and then to make a great number of trials oſ the diminution oſ its strength, by cutting it through on the concave side. This vould very nearly give us the proportion of the cohesion which really operates in resisting fractures. Thus, iſ it he ſounũd that one half oſ the beam may be out on the under side without diminution oſ its strength (taking care to drive in a slice 6 harder vood) ve moy conclude that the point A is at the middle; or somewhat above it. Much lies beſore the curious meehanięian, and ve are us yet very ſar ſrom a scientific knowledge oſ the strength oſ timber. 481. In the mean time, we may derive from these experiments oſ Buffon a very useſul practical rule, without relying on any value oſ the absolute cohesion of oak. We see that the strength is nearly as the breadth, as the square oſ the depth, and as the inverse oſ the length. It is most eonvenient to mensure the breadih anũ depth oſ the heam in inches, and iĩts length in feett. Since, then, a beam four inches square and seven ſeet betwæen the supports is broken by 5312 pounds, wæ must conelude that batten one inch square, and one ſoot het ween the supports, will be broken by 581 poundss. Then the strength oſ any other beam oſ onk, or the weight which will just break it vhen bung on its miadte, is 5815 But ve have seen that there is a very considerable deviation ſrom the inverse proportion oſ the lengths, and we must endeavour to accommoiate our rule to this deriationn. We ſound, that by adding 1295 to each oſ the ordinates or numhers in the eolumn of the b nch bors, we had a set oſ numbers very nearly reciprocal oſ the ſengths; and iſ we make a similar addition to the other æclumns in the proportion oſ the cubes oſ the sizes, we have nearly the same result. The greatest eror (except in the ease of experiments which re very irregular) does not exc|ed à,th of the whole Thereſore, for a radieal number, add to the 5312 the number 640, which ĩs to 1245 very neurly as 40 to 5. This gives 5952. The Gàth of this is 93, which corresponds to a bar oſ one inch square and seven ſeet long. Thereſore 98 x 7 wiil he the reciprocal eorresponding to a bar oſ one ſoot. This is 651. Take from this the present empirical eorrection, which is ;’ or. 10, and there remains 6Gà1 ſor the strength of the bar. This gives us ſor a generãl rule 2 P = 651 moa. Example. Required the weight necessary to break an onk beam eight inches square and 20 ſeet between the a 8x 8 10 x8 x 8:. This is 11515, whereas the experiment gives 11487. The error is very small indeed. The rule is most deficient in comparison with the five-ineh bars, which we have already said appear stronger than the rest. The ſollowing process is easily remembered by such as are not algebraists. Multiply the breadth in inches twice by the depth, and call this product 7 Multiply f by 651, and divide by the length in ſeet. From the quotient take IO times ſ. The remainder is the number of pounds which will break the beam. We are not sufficiently sensible of our principles to be confident that the correction 10 7 should be in the proportion of the section, although we think it most probable It is quite empirical, founded on Bufſon's experiments. Thereſore the saſe way oſ using this rule is Lo suppose the beam square, by increasing or diminishing its breadth till equal to the depth. Then find the strength by this rule, and diminish or increase it ſor the change which has been made in its breadth. Thus, there can be no doubt that the strength oſ the heam given as an example ĩs double oſ that oſ a beam oſ the same depth and half the breadth. The reader cannot but observe that all this calculation relates to the very greatest weight which a beam will bear for a very ſew minutess. Mr Buffon uniſormly ſound that two-thirds of this weight sensibly impaired its strength, and ſrequently broke it at the end of two or three monthss. One halſ of this weight brought the heam props, p = 651 x to a certain bend, which did not increase aſter the first minute or two, and may be horne by the beam for any length of time. But the beam contracted a bend, oſ which it did not recover any considerable portion. Onethird seemed to have no permanent efſect on the beam; but it recovered its rectilineal shape completely, even aſter having heen loaded several months, provided that the timber was seasoned when first loaded; that is to say, one-third oſ the weight which would quickly break a seosoned beam, or one- ſourth of what would break one just felled, may lie on it for ever without giving the beam a sett. We have no detail oſ experiments on the strength of other kinds oſ timber; only Mr Buſion says, that fir has about ſęths oſ the strength oſ oak; Mr Parent makes it j5ths; Emerson, jds, &e. We have been thus minute in our examination oſ the mechanism of this transverse strain, because it is the greatest to which the parts oſ our machines are æxposed. We wish to impress on the minds of artists the necessity oſ avoiding this as much as possiblee. They are improving in this respect, as may he seen by comparing the centres on which stone arches of great span are now turmed with those oſ former times. They were formerly a load oſ mere joists resting on a multitude oſ posts, which obstructed the navigation, and were ſrequently losing their shape by some of the posts sinking into the ground. Now they are more generally trusses, where the beams abutt on each other, and are relieved ſrom transverse strains. But many performances of eminent artists are still very injudieiously exposed to cross strainss. Ve may instance one which is considered as a fine work, viZæ. the bridge at Walton on Thamess. Here every heam of the great arch is a joist, and it hangs together by ſraming. The finest piece oſ carpentry that we have seen is the centre employed in turning the arches oſ the bridge at Orleans, deseribed by Perronet. In the whole there is not one eross strain. The beam, too, oſ Hornblowers steam-engine is very scientiſically constructed. 452. IV. The last speeies oſ strain which we are to examine is that produced by twisting. This takes place in. all axles which conneet the working parts of mothines: Although we eannot pretend to have a very distinot conception of that modification oſ the cohesion oſ a hody by which it resists this kind oſ strain, we can have no doubt that, when all the particles act alike, the resistance must be proportional to the numher. Therefore if we mppose the two parts ABCD, ABFE Fig. 24. oſ the hody EFCD to be oſ imsuperable strength, but cohering more weakly in the common surſace AB, and that one part ABCD is pushed laterally in the direction AB, there can be no doubt that it will yield only there, and that the resistanee will he proportional to the surface. 483. In like manner, we can conceive a thin cylindrical tube, of which KAH Fig. 25. is the seetion, as cohering more weakly in that seetion than anywhere else. Buppose it to be grasped in both hands, and the two parts twisted round the axis in opposite directions, as we would twist the two joints oſ a ſlute, it is plain that it ill first ſail in this seetion, which is the cireumſerence oſ a circle, and the particles of the two parts which are contiguous to this circumference will be drawn ſrom each other laterally The total resistance will be as the number of equally resisting particles, that is, as the eircumference (for the tube being supposed very thin, there ean be no sensible difſerence hetween the dilatation oſ the external and internal particles)) We can now suppose another tube within this, and a third within the seeond, and s0 on tiũll we reach the centree Iſ the porticles oſ eneh ring exerted the same ſorce (by suffering the same dilatation in the direction of the circumferenee), the resistance of each ring of the section would be as its eircumſerence and its breadth (supposed indefinitely small), and the whole resistance would be as the surſace; and this would represent the resistanee of a solid eylinder. But when a cylinder is twisted in this manner by an external foree applied to its eircumſerence, the external parts will suſſer a greater circular extension than the internal; and it appears that this extension (like the extension oſ a heam stroined transversely) will be proportional to the distance oſ the particles ſrom the axiss. We eannot say that this is demonstrable, but we can assign no proportion that is more probable This being the case, the forces simultaneously exerted by each particle will be us its distance ſrom the axis. Thereſore the wholo ſorce exerted by each ring will be as the square oſ its radius, und the accumulated ſorce actually exerted will be as the eube of the radius; that is, the accumulated force exerted by the whole cylinder, whose radius is CA, is to the accumulated force exerted at the sume time by the part whose radius is CE, as CAò to CE⸗. The whole eohesion now exerted is just two thirds of vhat it would be iſ all the particles were exerting the same attractive ſorces which are just now exerted by the particles in the external circumferencee This is plain to any person in the least familiar with the ſluxionary ealculus. But sueh as are not may easily see it in this wnay. Let the rectangle AC c a Fig. 25. be set upright on the surſace of the circle along the line CA, and revolve round the axis Ce. It will generate a cylinder whose height is Cc or A a, and having the circle KAH for its buse Iſ the diagonal C a be supposed also to revolve, it ĩs plain that the triangle c C a will generate a cone oſ the same height, and having for its base the circle deseribed by the revolution oſ c a, and the point C for its apex. The eylin- drical surſace generated by A a will express the whole cohesion exerted by the circumſerence AHE, and the eylindrical surſace generated by E e will represent the eohesion exerted by the circumference ELM, and the solid generated hy the triangle CA a will represent the eohesion exerted by the whole cirele AHK, and the cylinder generated hy the rectangle AC c a will represent the cohesion exerted by the same surface iſ each particle had suffered the extension A o. Nov it is plain, in the first place, that the solid generated by the triangle e EC is to that generated by a AC as ECO to AC?. In the next place, the solid generated by a AC is two- thirds oſ the cylinder, because the cone generated by c C a is one-third of it. 481. We may now suppose the cylinder twisted till the particles in the external circumſerence lose their cohesion. There can be no doubt that it will now be wrenched asunder, all the inner cireles yielding in succession. Thus we obtain one useſul piece oſ inſormation, viæ. that a body ofſ homogeneous texture resists a simple twist with two-thirds of the ſorce with which it resists an attempt to force one part laterally from the other, or with one-third part oſ the ſorce which will cut it asunder by a square-edged tool. For to drive a square-edged tool through a piece oſ lead, ſor instance, is the same as ſorcing a piece oſ the lead as thick as the tool laterally away from the two pieces on each side oſ the tool. Experiments of this kind do not seem difficult, and they would give us very useſul information. 485. When two eylinders AHK and BNO Fig. 25. are wrenched asunder, ve must conclude that the external particles oſ each are just put beyond their limits oſ cohesion, are equally extended, and are exerting equal ſorces. Hence it follows, that in the instant of fracture the sum total of the forces actually exerted are as the squares of the diameters. For drawing the diagonal Ce, it is plain that E e, = Aa, expresses the distension of the circumſerence ELM, and that the solid generated by the triangle CE e, expresses the cohesion exerted by the surſace of the cirele ELM, when the particles in the circumſerence suffer the extension E e equal to Aa. Now the solids generated by CAa and CE e being respectively two-thirds oſ the corresponding cylinders, are as the squares oſ the diameters. 486. Having thus ascertained the real strength oſ the section, and its relation to its absolute lateral strength, let us examine its strength relative to the external ſorce employed to break it. This examination is very simple in the case under consideration. The straining ſoree must act by some lever, and the cohesion must oppose it by acting on some other lever. The centre oſ the section may be the neutral point whose position is not disturbed. j Let F be the force exerted laterally by an exterior porticle Let o be the radius oſ the cylinder, æ the indeterminate distance of any cireumſerence, and æ the indeſinitely small interval between the concentric arches; that is, let æ be the breadth oſ a ring and æ its radius. The ſorces being as the extensions, and the extensions as the distances ſrom the axis, the cohesion actually exerted at any part oſ any ring will be æ The ſorce exerted by the whole ring (being as the circumſerence or as the ⸗ radius) will be f The momentum oſ eohesion of . a a ring, being as the ſoree multiplied by its lever, ill be 5 I  ſThe accumulated momentum will be the sum u ; a' or ſluent olr, that is, when x =a, it will be  f it: =is. 487. Hence we learn that the strength oſ an axle, by which it resists being wrenched asunder by a force acting at a given distance ſrom the axis, is as the cube oſ ĩts diameter. But farther, ; ſub is =fu' x  a. Nov faſ represents the full lateral eohesion of the seetion. The momentum thereſore is the same as if the full lateral cohesion. were aceumulated at a point distant ſrom the axis by ;th of the radius, or Ith oſ the diameter of the eylinder. Thereſore let F be the number of pounds which measures the lateral cohesion oſf a circular inch, d the diameter oſ the cylinder in inches, and I the length oſ the lever by which the straining force » is supposed to aet, 3 ve shall have F x 3 à? =pb and F 3 =& We see in general that the strength of an axle, by which ĩt resists being wrenched asunder by twisting, is as the cube oſ its diameter. 488. We see also that the internal parts are not acting 50 poverſully as the external. I a hole be bored out of the axle oſ halſ its diameter, the strengih is diminished only ſth, while the quantity oſ matter is diminished th. Thereforæ hollow axles are stronger than solid ones containing the same quantity of matter. Thus let the iiameter be 5 and that of the hollow 4: then the diameter oſ another solid eylinder having the same quantity oſf matter with the tube is S The strength oſ the solid cylinder oſ the diameter 5 may be expressed by 5° or 125. Of this the internal part (of the diameter 4) exerts 643 thereſore the strength of the tube is I2564,  6I. But the strength oſ the solid axle oſ the same quantity of matter and diameter 3 is 35, or 27, which is not half of that of the tube. l 489. Engineers, thereſore, have oſ Iate introduced this improvement in their machines, and the axles of cast iron ure all made hollow when their size will admit it. They have the additional advantage oſ being mueh stifſer, and oſ aſſording mueh better fixure ſor the ſlaunches, which are used for conneeting them with the wheels or levers by which they are turned and strainedl. The superiority oſ strength oſ hollow tubes over solid cylinders is much greater in this kind of strain than in the former or transverse. In this last case the strength oſ this tube would be to that oſ the solid cylinder oſ equal weight as 6l to S324 nearly. 490. The apparatus which we mentioned on a former occasion for trying the lateral strengih of a square inch of solid matter, enabled us to try this theory oſ tuist with all desirable accuracy. The bar which hung down ſfrom the pin in the former trials was now placed in a horizontal position, and loaded with a weight at the extremity. Thus it acted as a powerſul lever, and enabled us to wrench asunder specimens of the strongest material. We ſound the results perſectly eonſormable to the theory, in as ſar as it determined the proportional strength oſ different sizes and ſorms: but we ſound the ratio oſ the resistance to twisting to the simple lateral resistance eonsiderably different; and it was some time beſore we discorered the cause. 491. We had here taen the simplest view that iĩs possible oſ the action of eohesion in resisting a twist. It is ſrequently exerted in a very difſerent wayg When, ſor instance, an iron axle is joined to a wooden one by heing driven into one end of it, the extensions oſ the different cireles oſ partieles are in a very diſſerent proportionn A little consideration will show that the purticles in immediate contact with the iron axle are in à state oſ violent extension; so are the particles o the exterior surſace of the wooden part, and the intermediate parts are les strained. It is almost impossible to assign the exact proportion oſ the cobesiv; ſorces exerted in the diſſerent part:. Numberless cases can he pointed out where parſs of the axle are in a state oſ compression, and where it is still more difficult to determine the state oſ the other particles We must content ourselves with the deduetions made ſrom this simple case, whiẽh is fortunately the most common. In the experiments just now mentioned, the centre oſ the cirele is by no means the neutral point, and it is very diſficult to ascertain its place: but when this consideration oceurred to us; we easily freed the experiments from this uncertainty, by extending the lever 10 hoth sides, and by means of a pulley applied equal ſorce to each arm, acting in opposite directionss Thus the centre became the neutral point, and the resistance to twist was found to be àds of the simple lateral strength. 492. We beg leave to mention here that our success in these experiments encouraged us to extend them much ſarther. We hoped by these means to discover the absolute cohesion oſ many substanees, which would have required an enormous apparatus and a most unmanageable force to tear them asunder directly. But we could reason with confidence ſrom the resistance to twist (which we could easily measure), provided that we could ascertain the proportion of the direct and the lateral strengths. Our experiments on chalk, finely prepared clay, and white bees wax, (oſ one melting and one temperature), were very consistent and satisſactory. But we have hitherto found great irregularities in this proportion in bodies oſ a ſibrous texture like timber. These are the most important cases, and we still hope to be able to accomplish our project, and to give the public some valuable inſormation. This being our sole object, it was our duty to mention the method which promises suceess, and thus excite others to the task; and it will be no mortiſieation to us to be deprived oſ the honour oſ heing the first who Ahus adds to the stock of experimental knowledge: When the matter of the axle is oſ the most simple texture, such as that oſf metals, we do not conceive that the length oſ the axle has any influence on the ſracture. It is otherwise iſ it be oſ a fibrous texture like timber: the fibres are bent beſore breaking, being twisted into spirals like a cork-serew. The length oſ the axle has somewhat oſ the influence of a lever in this case, and it is easier wrenched asunder if long. Accordingly we have found it 30; but we have not been able to reduee this inſluence to calculation. 403. The reader is requested to accept of these endeavours to communicate inſormation on this important and diſficult subject. We are duly sensible of their imperfection, but ſlatter ourselves that we have in many instances pointed out the method which must be pursued for improving our knowledge on this subject; and we have given the English reader a more copious list oſ experiments on the strength oſf materials than he will meet with in our language Many useſul deductions might be made from these premises respecting the manner oſ disposing and combining the strength oſ materials in our structures. The best form oſ joists, mortises, tenons, scarphs; the rules for joggling, tabling, faying, fishing, &e. practised in the delicate art oſ mastmaking, are all founded on this doctrine: but the discussion oſ these would be equivalent to writing a evmplete treatise oſ corpentry. We hope that this will be executed by some intelligent mechanician, for there is no mechanic art that is more susceptible oſ scientific treatment. Sueh a treatise, iſ well executed, could not ſail of being well received by the public in this age oſ mechanical improvement *. * For ſarther inſormation upon this subject, the reader is reſerred to the article CanrETRY, and to the other urticles where this subject itreated oſ, in the Zdinburgh Encyclopædia, conducted by Dr BeiwsTES, En. CARPENTRY. 491. Canrsvrav is the art of ſraming timber ſor the purposes oſ architecture, machinery, aud, in general, ſor all considerable structures. It is not intended in this artiele to give a full account of carpentry as a mechanical art, or to describe the various ways of executing its difſerent works, suited to the variety oſ materials employed, the processes which must be ſollowed ſor ſashioning and ſraming them for our purposes, and the tools which must be used, and the manner in which they must be handled: This would be an oœeupation ſor volumes; and though of great importance, must be entirely omitted heree. Our only aim at present vill be to deduee, ſfrom the principles and laws oſ mechanics, and the knowledge which experience and judicious inferences ſrom it have given us concerning the strength of timher, in relation to the strain laid on it, such maxims of construction as will unite economy with strength and efficacy. This object is 10 he attained by a knovledge, lst, of the strength oſ our materials, and of the absolute strain that is to be Iaid on them; dly, of the modiſications oſ this strain, hy the place and direction in which it is exerted, and the changes that can be made by a proper disposition oſ the parts of our structure; and, Sdly, having disposed every piece in such a manner as to derive the utmost advantage ſrom its relative strength, vè must know how to ſorm the joints and other connections, in such a manner as to secure the advantages derived ſrom this disposition. 495. This is evidently a branch o meehanical science which makes carpentry a liberal art, constitutes part oſ the learning of the EvoinerR, and distinguishes him ſrom the workman. Its importance in all time and states of civil society is maniſest and great. In the present condition of these kingdoms, raised, by the active ingenuity and energy oſ our countrymen, to a piteh oſ prosperity und influence unequalled in the history of the world, a condition which eonsists chieſly in the superiority of our manuſactures, attained by prodigious multiplication oſ engines of every description, and for every speeies oſ labour, the ScizscE (0 to term it) oſ carpentry is oſ immense consequence:. We regret thereſore exeeedingly, that none oſ our celebrated artists have done honour to themselves and their country, by digesting into a body of consecutive doctrines the results oſ their great experience, so as to form a system from which their pupils might derive the first principles oſ their educationn. The many volumes called CompLE?E? INSTRUCTORS, MANUALS, JEWELS, &e. take a much humbler ſlight, and content themselves with instructing the mere workman, or sometimes give the master builder a few approved ſorms 6f rooſs and olther ſramings, with the rules for drawing them on paper; and ſrom thence forming the working draughts which must guide the sav and the ehissel' oſ the workmmn. Hurdly any oſ them offer any thing that can be ealled a principle, applicable to many purticular cases, with the rules for this adaptation. We are indebted for the greatest part of our knowledge oſ this suljeet to the labours oſ literary men, chieſly foreigners, vho have voL. .. Ri published in the memoirs oſ the learned academies dissertations on difſerent parts of what may be termed the science of carpentry. 496. The theory oſ carpentry is. founded on two distinct portions oſ mechanical science, namely, a knowledge oſ the strains to which ſramings of timber are exposed, and a knowledge oſ their relative strength. We shall therefore attempt to bring into one point of view the propositions oſ mechanical science that are more immediately applicable to the art oſ carpentry, and are to be ſound in various parts of this work, particularly under Itoof and Strength of Materialss. From these propositions we hope to deduce such principles as shall enable an attentive reader to comprehend distinctly what is to be aimed at in framing timber, and how to attain this object with certainty: and we shall illustrate and confirm our principles by examples of pieces oſ carpentry which are acknowledged to be excellent in their kind. 497. The most important proposition oſ general mechanits to the carpenter is that which exhibits the composition and resolution oſ forces; and we beg our praetical readers to endeavour to ſorm very distinet conceptions oſ it, and to make it very ſamiliar to their mind. When accommodated to their chieſ purposes, it may be thus expressed: l. If a body, or any part of a hody, be at once pressed in the two directions AB, AC (Plate VI. fig. 1), and if the intensity or ſorce oſ those pressures he in the proportion oſ these two lines, the body is aſſected in the same manner as iſ it were pressed hy a single ſorce acting in the direction AD, which is the diagonal of the parallelogram ABDC ſormed by the two lines, and whose intensity has the same proportion to the intensity oſ each oſ the other two that AD has to AB or AC. Such oſ our readers as have studied the laws of motion, know that this is fully demonstratedlc We reſer them to the article DvNamnies, where it is treated at some length. The praetitioner in carpentry will get more useſul confidence in the doctrine, i he will shut his book, and verify the theoretical demonstrations by actual experiment. They are remarkahly easy and convineing. Thereſore it is our request that the artist, who is not s0 hahitually acquainted with the subject, do not proceed ſurther till he has made it quite familiar to his thoughts. Nothing is so conducive to this as the actual experiment; and since this only requires the triſling expence oſ two small pulleys and a few yards oſ whipcord, ve hope that none of our practical readers will omit it. 2. Let the threads A d, AF b, and AE e (fig. 2.), have the weights d, b, and e, appended to them, and let two oſ the threads be laid over the pulleys F and E By this npparatus the knot A will be drawn in the directions AB, AC, and AK. If the sum oſ the weights  and c be greater than the single weight d, the assemblage will oſ itselſ settle in a certain determined form; if you pull the Enot A out oſ its place, it will always return to it again, and will rest in no other positionn. For example, iſ the three weights are equal; the threads will always make equal angles, of 120 degrees each, round the knot. Iſ one of the weights be three pounds, another four, and the third five, the angle opposite to the thread stretched by five pounds will always be square, &cc When the knot A is thus in equilibrio, we must infer, that the action of the weight d, in the direction A d, is in direct opposition to the combined action oſ b, in the direction AB, and of c, in the direction ACC Thereſore, if we produce d A to any point D, and take AD to represent the magnitude of the force, or pressure exerted by the weight d, the pres- sures exerted on A by the weights b and c, in the directions AB, AC, are in ſact equivalent to a pressure acting in the direction AD, whose intensity we have represented by AD. Ir we now measure ofſf by a scale on AF and AE the lines AB and AC, having the same proportions to AD that the weights b and c have to the weight d, and if we draw DB and DC, we shall find DC to be equal and parallel to AB, and DB equal and parallel to AC: s0 that AD is the diagonal oſ a parallelogram ABDC. We shall find this always to be the case, whatever are the weights made use of; only we must take care that the weight which we eause to act without the intervention oſ a pulley be less than the sum of the other two: iſ any one oſf the weights exceeds the sum of the other two, it will prevail, and drag them along with it. Now, since we know that the weight d would just balance an equal weight 5, pulling directly upwards by the intervention of the pulley G; and since we see that it just balances the weights b and c, acting in the directions AB, AC, ve must infer, that the knot A is aſſeeted in the same manner by those two weights, or by the single weight ; and thereſore, that iwo pressures, acting in the directions. and with the intensities, AB, AC, are equivalent to a single pressure having the direction und proportion of AD. In like manner, the pressures AB, AK, are equivalent to AH, which is equal and opposite to AC. Also AX and AC are equivalent to AI, which is equal and opposite to AB. 498. We shall consider this combination oſ pressures a little more partioularly. : Suppose an upright beam BA Fig. 3. pushed in the direction oſ its length by a load B, and abutting on the ends of two beams AC, AD, which are firmly resisted at their extreme points C and D, which rest on two hlocks, but are nowise joined to them: these two beams can re- sist no way but in the direetions CA, DA: and thereſore the pressures which they sustain ſrom the beam BA are in the directions AC, AD. We wish to know how much each sustains? Produee BA to E, taking AE ſrom a scale of equal parts, to represent the number oſ tons or pounds by which BA is pressedl. Drav EF and EG parallel to AD and AC; then AF, measured on the sume scale, will give us the number of pounds by which AC is strained or crushed, and AG will give the strain on AD. It deserves particular remark here, that the length of AC or AD has no influence on the strain, arising ſrom the thrust of BA, while the directions remain the same. The effects, however, oſ this strain are modified by the Iength oſ the piece on which ĩt is exertedl. This strain compresses the beam, and will thereſore compress a beam of double length twice as much. This may change the form oſ the assemblage. If AC, ſor example, be very much shorter than AD, it will be much less compressed: The line CA will turn ahout the centre C, while DA will hardly change its position; and the angle CAD will grow more open, the point A sinking down. The artist will fmd it of great consequence to pay à very minute attention to this circumstance, and to be able to see clearly the ehange of shape which necessarily results from these mutual strainss. He will see in this the couse oſ failure in many very great works. By thus changing shape, strains are often produced in places where there were none before, and ſrequently of the very worst kind, tending to break the benms across. The dotted ſines of this figure shew another position oſ the heam AD. This makes a prodigious change, not only in the strain on AI, but also in that on AC. Both oſ them are much increased; AG iĩs almost doubled, and AF is four times greater than before This addition was made to the figure, to shew what enormous strains may be produced by a very moderate force AE, when it is exerted on a very ohtuse angle. The 4th and 5th figures will assist the most uninstrueted reader in conceiving how the very same strains AF, AG, are laid on these beams, by a weight simply hanging from a billet resting on A, pressing hard on AD, and also leaning a little on AC; or hy an upright piece AE, joggled on the two beams AC, AD, and perſorming the office of an ordinary king-post. The reader will thus learn to call ofſ his attention ſfrom the means by which the strains are produced, and learn to consider them abstractedly, merely as strains, in whatever situation he finds them, and ſrom whatever cause they arise. We presume that every reader will perceive, that the proportions oſ these strains will be precisely the same iſ every thing be inverted, and each beam he drawn or pulled in the opposite direction. In the same way that we have substituted a rope and weight in Fig. 4. or a kingpost in Fig. 5. ſor the loaded beam BA oſ Fig. 3. we might have substituted the ſraming of Fig. 6. which is a very usual practice. In this ſraming, the batten DA is stretehed by a ſorce AG, and the piece AC is compressed by a ſorce AF. It is evident, that we may employ a rope, or an iron rod hooked on at D, in place of the batten DA, and the strains will be the same as before. This seemingly simple matter is still full oſ instruction; and we hope that the well informed reader will pardon us, though we dwell a little longer on it for the sake oſ the young artist. By changing the form oſ this framing, as in Fig. 7. we produce the same strains as in the disposition represented by the dotted lines in Fig. 3. The strains on hoth the battens AD,  AC, are now greatly increased. The same consequences result ſrom an improper change oſ the position of AC. II it is placed as in Fig. 5. the strains on hoth are vastly increased. In short, the rule is general; that the more open we make the angle against which the push is exerted, the greater are the strains which are brought on the strutts or ties which ſorm the sides of the angle. The reader may not readily conceive the piece AC oſ Fig. S. as sustaining a compression; for the weight B appears to hang ſrom AC as much as from AD. But his doubts will be removed by considering whether he could employ a rope in place oſ AC. He cannot: But AD may be exchanged ſor a rope. AC is therefore a strutt, and not a tie. In Fig. 9. AD is again a strutt, butting on the block D, and AC is a tie: and the hatten AC may be replaced by a rope. While AD is compressed by the ſorce AG, AC is stretched by the force AF. If we give AC the position represented hy the dotted lines, the compression of AD is now AG', and the force stretching AC is now AF; both much greater than they were before This dispositton is analogous to Fig. 6. and to the dotted lines in Fig. 3. Nor will the young artist have any doubts oſ AC' being on the streteh, iſ he consider whether AD can be replaced by a rope. It cannot, but AC may; and it is therefore not compressed, but stretched. In Fig. IO. all the three pieces, AC, AD, and AB, are ties, on the stretch. This is the complete inversion of Fig. S.; and the dotted position oſ AC induces the same changes in the forces AF, AG, as in Fig. S. Thus have we gone over all the varieties which can happen in the bearings oſ three pieces on one point. All calculations about the strength of carpentry are reduced to this case: for when more ties or braces meet in a point (a thing that rarely happens), we reduce them to three, by substituting for any two the ſorce which results ſrom their combination, and then combining this with another; and so on. The young artist must be particularly careſul not to mistake the kind of strain that is exerted on any piece of the framing, and suppose a piece to be a brace which is really a tie. It is very easy to avoid all mistakes in this matter by the ſollowing rule, which has no exception. 499. Take notice oſ the direction in which the piece acts ſrom which the stræin proceeds. Draw a line in that direction ſrom the point on which the strain is exerted; and let its length (measured on some seale oſ equal parts) express the magnitude oſ this action in pounds, hundreds, or tonss. From its remole extremity draw lines purallel to the pieces on which the strain is exertedc. The line parallel to one piece will necessarily cut the other, or its direction produced: If it cut the piece itselſ, that piece is compressed by the strain, and it is perſorming the oſſice of a strutt or brace: if it cut its direction produced, the piece is stretched, and it is a tie. In short, the strains on ihe pieces AC, AD, are to be estimated in the direction oſ the points F and G ſrom the strained point A Thus, in Fig. S. the upright piece BA, loaded with the weight B, presses the point A in the direetion AE: so does the rope AB in the other figures, or the hatten AB in Fig. 5. In general, iſ the straining piece is within the angle formed by the pieces which are strained, the strains which they sustain are oſ the opposite kind to that which it exerts. Iſ it be pushing, they are drawing; but iſ it be within the angle ſormed by their directions produced, the strains which they sustain are oſ the same kind. All the three are either drawing or pressingg If the straining piece lie within the angle formed by one piece and the produced direction oſ the other, its own strain, whether gcompression or extension, is oſf the same kind with thut of the most remote of the other two, and opposite to that oſ the nearest. Thus, m Fig, 9. where AB is drawing, the remote pieee AC is also drawing, while AD is pushing or resisting compression. In all that has been said on this subject, we have not spoken oſ any joints. In the calculations with which we are occupied at present, the resistance oſ joints has no share; and we must not suppose that they exert any ſorce which tends to prevent the angles ſrom changing. The joints are supposed perſectly ſlexible, or to be like compass joints; the pin of which only keeps the pieces together when one or more of the pieces draws or pulls. The carpenter must always suppose them all compass joints, when he enleulates the thrusts and draughts oſ the diſferent pieces oſ his ſrames. The strains on jomts, and their power to produce or halance them, are of a different kind, and require a very different examination. 500. Seeing that the angles which the pieces make with each other are oſ such importance to the mognitude and the proportion oſ the excited strains, it is proper to find out some way oſ readily and compendiously conceiving and expressing this analogy. In general, the strain on any piece is proportional to the straining ſorce. This is evident. Secondly, the strain on any piece AC is proportional to the sine oſ the angle which the straining ſoree makes with the other piece directly, and to the sine oſ the angle which the pieces make with each other inversely. For it is plain, that the three pressures AE, AF, and AG, which are exerted at the point A, are in the proportion oſ the lmes AE, AF, and FE, (because FE is equal to AG). But hecause the sides of a triangle are proportional to the sinès oſf the opposite angles, the strains are proportional to the smes of the angles AFE, AEF, and FAE. But the sine of AFE is the same with the sine of the angle CAD, which the two pieces AC and AD moke with eaeh other; and the sine or AEF is the same with the sine of EAD, which the straining piece BA makes with the piece ACC. Thereſore we have this analogy, Sin. CAD: Sin. EAD  AE: AF, and Sin EAD AF æ AE x i Cl conveniently conceived as decimal ſractions oſ the radius, which is considered as unity. Thus, Sin. 300 is the same thing with 0.5, or 4: and so oſ otherss Thereſore, to have the strain on AC, arising ſfrom any load AE acting in the direction AE, multiply AE by the sine of EAD, and divide the produet by the sine of CAD. This rule shews how great the strains must he when the angle CAD hecomes very open, approaching to I80 degreess Bul when the angle CAD becomes very small, its sine (which is our divisor) is also very small; and ve should expect a very great quotient in this ease also. But we must observe, that in this case the sine of EAD is also very small; and this is our multiplier. In such a case, the quotient cannot exceed unity. But it is unnecessary to consider the calculation by the tables oſ sines more particularly The angles are seldom known any otherwise but by drawing the figure of the frame oſ carpentry. In this case, we can always obtain the measures oſ the strains ſrom the same scale, with equal accuracy, by drawing the parallelogram AFCG. 501. Hitherto we have considered the strains excited at A only as they affect the pieces on which they are exerted. But the pieces, in order to sustain, or be subject to any strain, must be supported at their ends C and D; and we may consider them as mere intermediums, by which these strains are made to act on those points oſ support: Therefore AF and AG are also measures of the forces which press or pull at C and D. Thus we learn the supports which must be found ſor these points. Now the sine oſ angles are most ——— These may be infinitely variouss We shall attend only to sueh as somehow depend on the ſraming itself. 502. Such a structure as Fig. 11. very ſrequently occurs, where a heam BA is strongly pressed to the end of another beam AD, which is prevented ſrom yielding, hoth because it lies on another beam HD, and because its end D is hindered from sliding backwards:. It is indifferent ſrom what this pressure arises: we have represented iĩt as owing to a weight hung on at B, while B is withheld from yielding by a rod or rope hooked to the wal. The heam AD may be supposed at full liberty to exert all its pressure on D, as iſ it were supported on rollers lodged in the beam HD; but the loaded heam BA presses both on the beam AD and on HD. We wish only to know what strain is borne by AD? All bodies act on each other in the direetion perpendicular to their touching surſaces; thereſore the support given by HD is in a direction perpendicular to it. We may therefore supply its place at A hy a heam AC, perpendicular to HD, and firmly supported at C. In this case, thereſore, ve may take AE as heſore, to represent the pressure exerted by the loaded heam, and drav EG perpendicular to AD, and EF parallel to it, meeting the perpendicular AC in F. Then AG is the strain compressing AD, and AF is the pressure on the beam HD. 503. It may be thought, that, since we assume as a principle that the mutual pressures oſ solid bodies are exerted perpendicular to their touching surſaces, this halance of pressures, in ſframings oſ timbers, depends on the directions of their butting joints: but it does not, as will readily appear by considering the present case. Let the joint or abutment oſ the two pieces BA, AD, be mitred, in the usual manner, in the direction ſ A ſ. Thereſore, if A e be drawvn perpendicular to A f, it will be the direction oſ the actual pressure exerted hy the loaded beam BA on the beam AD. But the reaction of AD, in the opposite direction A t, will not halaneæ the pressure of BA; hecause it is not in the direction precisely opposite BA will thereſore slide along the joint, and press on the beam HD. AE represents the load on the mitre joint A. Drav E e perpendicular to Ae, and E ſ porallel to it. The pressure AE will be halanced by the reactions e A and ſA: or, the pressure AE produces the pressures Ae and Af; oſ which Af must be resisted by the beam HD, and Ae by the beam AD. The pressure A ſ not being perpendicular to HD, cannot be fully resisted by it; because (by our assumed principle) it reacts only in a direction perpendicular to its surſacee. Therefore draw fp, ſi purallel to HD, and perpendicular o it. The pressure A f will be resisted by HD with the foree p A; but there is required another ſorce i A, to prevent the beam BA ſrom slipping outwards. This must be ſurnished by the reaction of the beam DA. In like manner, the other foree A e cannot be fully resisted by the heam AD, or rather by the prop D, acting hy the intervention oſ the heam; ſor the action oſ that prop is exerted through the beam in the direction DA. The hbeam AD, therefore, is pressed to the beam HD by the ſorce A e, as well às by Aſ. To find what this pressure on HD is, draw e g& perpendicular to HD, and e o parallel to it, cutting EG in r. The forces  A and o A will resist, and hulance Ae. Thus we see, that the two forces A e and A f, which are equivalent to AE, are equivalent also to A ꝓ, A ĩ, A o, and A 2. But because A f and e E are equal and porallel, and E r and fi are also parallel, as also er and ſp, it is evident, that i ſ is equal to r E, or to o F, and i Ais equal to re, or to G gZ. Thereſore the ſour ſorces A g, Ao, Ap, Ai, are equal to AG and AF. Consequently AG is the compression oſ the beam AD, or the ſorce pressing it on D, and AF is the force pressing it on the beam HD. The proportion of these pressures, thereſore, is not afſected by the ſorm oſ the joint. This remark is important; for many carpenters think the ſorm and direction oſ the butting joint of great importance; and even the theorist, by not prosecuting the general principle through all its consequences, may be led into an error. The form of the joint is of no importance, in as far as it aſſects the strains in the direetion oſ the beams; hut it is often oſ great consequence, in respect to its own firmness, and the efſect it may have in bruising the piece on which iĩt acts, or being crippled by it. 501. The same compression of AB, and the same thrust on the point D by the intervention of AD, will obtain, in whatever way the original pressure on the end A is produced. Thus supposing that a chord is made ſast at A, and pulled in the direotion AE, and with the same force, the beam AD will hbe equally compressed, and the prop D must react with the same ſorce. But it oſten happens that the obliquity oſ the pressure on AD, instead of compressing it, stretches it; and we desire to know what tension it sustains. Of this we have a ſamiliar example in a common rooſf. Let the two raſters AC, AD Fig. 12,, press on the tie beam DC. We may suppose the whole weight to press vertically on the ridge A, as iſ a weight B were hung on theree. We may represent this weight by the portion A b oſ the vertical or plumb line, intercepted between the ridge and the beam. Then drawing b f and b & purallel to AD and AC, A  and A f will represent the pressures on AC and AD. Produce AC till CH be equal to A ſ. The point C is ſoreed out in this direction, and with a force represented by this Iinee As this force is not perpendicularly across the beam, it evidently stretches it; and this extending ſorce must be withstood by an equal force pulling it in the opposite direetion. This must arise ſrom a similar oblique thrust oſ the opposite raſter on the other end D. We concern ourselves only with this extension at present; but we see that the cohesion of the beam does nothing but supply the halance to the extending ſorces. It must still be supported externally, that it may resist, and, by resisting obliquely, be stretched. The points C and D are supported on the walls, which they press in the directions CK and DO, parallel to A b. I we draWv HK parallel to DC, and HI parallel to CK (that is, to A b), meeting DC produced in I, it follows ſrom the composition oſ forces, that the point C would be supported by the two forces KC and IC. In Iike manner, making DN æ A g, and completing the parallelogram DMNO, the point D would be supported by the forces OD and MD. If we draw g o and f I parallel to DC, it is plain that they are equal to NO and CK, while A o and A I are equal to DO and CK, and A b is equal to the sum oſf DO and CK (because it is equal to Ao +A l) The weight oſ the rooſ is equal to its vertical pressure on the walls. Thus we see, that while a pressure on A, in the direetion A b, produces the strains A ſ and A g, on the pieces AC and AD, it also excites a strain CI or DM in the piece DC. And this completes the mechanism oſ a ſrame; ſor all derive their efficacy from the triangles oſ which they are composed, as will appear more clearly as we proceed. 505. But there is more to be learned ſrom thiss The consideration oſ the strains on the two pieces AD and AC, by the action oſ a force at A, only shewed them aus the means of propagating the same strains in their own direction to the points oſ support. But, by adding the strains exerted in DC, we see that the ſframe becomes an intermedium, by which exertions may be made on other bodies, in certain directions and proportions; so that this frame may become part oſ a more complicated one, and, as it were, an element oſ its constitution. It is worth while to ascertain the proportion of the pressures CK and DO, which are thus exerted on the walls The similarity oſ triangles gives the following analogies: DO: DM æAb: bD CI, oo- DM: CK æCb: Ad Therefore DO: CK æCb: b D. , Or, the pressures on the points C und D, in the direction of the stroining force A b, are reciprocally proportional to the portions of DC intercepted by Ab. Also, since Ab is =/ DO + CK, we have Ab: CK Cb +b D (or CD): b D, and Ab: DOCD: b C. In general, any two of the three parallel forees A b, DO, CK, are to each other in the reciprocal proportion of the parts oſ CD, intercepted between their directions and the direction of the third. And this explains a still more important oſſice oſ the frame ADC. If one of the points, such as D, be supported, an external power acting at A, in the direction Ab, and with an intensity which may be measured by A b, may be set in equilibrio, with another acting at C, in the direction CL, opposite to CK, or A b, and with an intensity represented by CK: for since the pressure CH is partly withstood by the force IC, or the firmness of the beam DC supported at D, the force KC will complete the balance When we do not attend to the support at D, we conceive the force Ab to he balanced hy KC, or KC to be balanced by A b. And, in like manner, ve may neglect the support or ſoree acting at A, and consider the ſorce DO as halanced by CK. 506. Thus our frame becomes a lever, and we are able to trace the interior mechanical procedure which gives it its efſicacy: it is by the intervention of the ſorces oſ cohesion, which connect the poiuts to which the external ſorces are applied with the supported point or fulerum and with each other. : These strains or pressures A b, DO, and CK, not be ing in the directions of the beums, may be called ?ransversee We see that by their means a frame of carpentry may be considered as a solid hody: but the exæmple which brought this to our view is too limited for explaining the efficacy which may be given to suchh constructionss. We shall thereſore give a general proposition, which will more distinctly explain the procedure of nature, and enable us to trace the strains as they are propagated through all the paris oſ the most complicated ſraming, finally producing the exertion oſ its most distant points. 507. We presume that the reader is now pretty well habituated to the conception of the strains as they are propagated along the lines joining the points of a ſrame, and we shall thereſore employ a very simple figure. Let the strong lines ACBD Fig. 13. represent a frame oſ carpentry. Suppose that it is pulled at the point A by u force acting in the direction AE, but that it rests on a ſixed point C, and that the other extreme point B is held back by a power which resists in the direction BF: It irequired to determine the proportion of the strains excited in its difſerent parts, the proportion oſ the external pressures at A and B, and the pressure which is produced on the ohstacle or ſfulerum C? It is evident that each of the external forces at A and B tend one way, or to one side of the frame, and that each would cause it to turn round C if the other did not prevent it; and that if, notwithstanding their action, it is turned neither way, the ſorces in actual exertion are in equilibrio by the intervention of the frame. It is no less evident that these ſorces concur in pressing the frame on the prop C. Thereſore, if the piece CD were away, and iſ the joints C and D be perſectly flexible, the pieces CA, CB would be turned round the prop C, and the pieces AD, DB would also turn with them, and the whole ſframe change its ſorm This shews, by the vay, and we desire it to he careſully kept in mind, that the firmness or stiſſness oſ ſraming depends entirely on the triangles hounded by heams which are contained in it. An open quadrilateral may always change its shape, the sides revolving round the angless A quadrilateral may have an inſinity of ſorms, without any change oſ its sides, by merely pushing two opposite angles towards each other, or drawing them asunder. But when the three sides oſ a triangle are determined, its shape is also invariably determined; and if two angles be held ſast, the third cannot he moved. It ĩs thus that, by inserting the bar CD; the ſigure becomes unchangeable; and any attempt to change it by applying a force to an angle A, immediately excites ſorces oſ attraction or repulsion hetween the particles oſ the stuſſf which ſorms its sides. Thus it happens, in the present instance, that a change oſ shape is prevented by the bar CD. The power at A presses its end against the prop; and in doing this it puts the har AD on the stretch; and also the bar DB. Their places might thereſore be supplied by cords or metal wires. Hence it is evident that DC is compressed, as is also AC; and, ſor the same reason, CB is also in a state oſf compreasion; for either A or B may be considered as the point that is impelled or withheld.. Therefore DA and DB are stretehed, and are resisting with altractive ſorces. DC and CB are compressed, and are resisting with repulsive foreess DB is also acting with repulsive ſorces, being compressed in like manner: and thus the support oſ the prop, combined with the firmness of DC puts the frame ADBC into the condition of the two frames in Fig. 8. and Fig. 9. Thereſore the external force at A is really in equilibrio with an attracting force acting in the direction AD, and a repulsive ſorce acting vOL. I. E in the direction A. And since all the conneeting forceà are mutual and equal, the point D is pulled or drawn in the direction DA. The condition oſ the point B is similar to that oſ A, and D is also drawn in the direction DB. Thus the point D, being urged by the ſorces in the direetions DA and DB, presses the hbeam DC on the prop, and the prop resists in the opposite direction. Thereſore the line DC is the diagonal of the parallelogram, whose sides have the proportion oſ the ſorces which connect D with A and B. This is the principle on which the rest of our investigation proceedss We may take DC as the representation and measure of their joint effect. Therefore draw CH, CG, parallel to DA, DB, cutting AE, BF in L and O, and cutting DA, DB in I and M. Complete the parallelograms ILKA, MONB. Then DG and AI are the equal and opposite forees which connect A and D; ſor GD æ CH, æ AI. In like manner DH and BM are the forces which connect D and B. The external ſorce at A is in immediate equilibrio with the combined forces, connecting A with D and with C. AI is one oſ them: Therefore AX is the other; and AL is the compound force with which the external force at A is in immediate equilibrium. This external ſorce is thereſore equal and opposite to BO; and AL is to BO as the external ſorce at A to the external force at B. The prop C resists with ſorces equal to those which are propagated to it from the points D, A, and C. Thereſore it resists with forces CH, CG, equal and opposite to DG, DH; and it resists the compressions KA, NB, with equal and opposite ſorces C, Cn. Draw k, n o parallel to AD, BD, and draw CIQ, C o P: It is plain that  CH l is a parallelogram equal to KAIL, and that Cl is equal to AL. In like manner Co is equal to BO. Now the ſorces C&, CII, exerted by the prop, compose the ſorce CI; and C æ, CG compose the foree C o. These two forces C, Co sre equal and parallel to AL and BO; and thereſore they ure equal and oppbsite to the external forces acting at A and B. But they are (primitively) equal and opposite to the pressures (or at least the compounds of tlie pressures) exerted on the prop, by the forces propagated to C from A, D, and B. Thereſore the pressures exerted on the prop are the same as iſf the external forces were applied there in the same directions as they are applied to A and B. Now if we make CV, CZ equal to C and Co, and complete the parallelogram CVYZ; it is plain that the ſorce YC is in equilibrio with I C and o C. Thereſore the pressures at A, C, and B, are such as would balance if applied to one point. Lustly, in order to determine their proportions, dra CS and CR perpendicular to DA and DB. Also draw Ad, B f perpendicular to CQ and CP; and drav Cg, Ci perpendicular to AE, BF. The triangles CPR and BP f are similar, having a common angle P, and a right angle at R and . In like manner the triangles CQS and AQd are similar. Also the triangles CHR, CGS are similar, by reason oſ the equal angles at H and G, and the right angles at R and S. Hence we obtain the ſollowing analogies: Co: CP æO0n: PB, = CG: PB CP: CRæ PB: ſB CR: CS æ CH: CG CS: CQ æ Ad: AQ CQ: CI æm AQ: XI, m AQ: CH. Therefore, hy equality, Co: CI æ Ad: B or BO: AL= C”: Ci. That is, the external ſorces are reciprocally proportional to the perpendiculars drawn ſrom the prop on the lines oſ their direction. * * The learned reader will perceive, that this analogy is precisely the ame with that oſ ſorces which are in equilibrio by the intervention oſ æ This proposition (sufficiently general ſor our purpose) is ſertile in consequences, and ſurnishes many useful instructions to the artist. The strains LA, OB, CY, that are excited, occur in many, ve may say in all, ſramings oſ carpentry, whether for ediſices or engines, and are the sources oſ their efficacy Tt is alæo evident, that the doctrine oſ the transverse strength oſ timber is contained in this proposition; for every piece oſ timber may be considered as an assemblage oſ parts, connected by ſorces which act in the direction. oſ the lines which join the straimed points on the matter which lies between those points, and also act on the rest oſ the matter, exciting those lateral forces which produce the inſlexibility oſ the whole. See STRENGTH OF MaTERIALS. Thus it appears that this proposition contains the principles which direct the artist to ſrame the most powerſul levers; to secure uprights by shores or braces, or by ties and ropes; to secure scafſoldings for the erection oſ spires, lever. In fact, this whole ſrame of carpentry is nothing else than a built or ſramed lever in equilibrio. It is acting in the same manner as a solid, which occupies the whole figure compressed in the frame, or as a body oſ any rize and shape whatever, that will admit the three points oſ application A, C, and B. It is alvays in equillbrio in the case ſirst stated; hecause the pressure produced at B by a ſorce applied to A is always such as haIances it. The reader may also perceive, in this proposition, the analysis or tracing of those internal mechanical forces which are indispensably requisite ſor the functions oſ a lever. The mechanicians have heen extremeIy puzzied to find a legitimate demonstration oſ the equilibrium of a lever ever since the days of Archimedes. Mr Vince has the honour oſ first demonstrating, most ingeniously, the principle assumed by Archimedes, but without sufficient ground, ſor his demonstration: but Mr Vince's demonstration is only a putting the mind into that perjloxed state which makes it ncknowledge the proposition, but without a clear perception of its truth. The diſiculty has proceeded ſrom the abstract notion oſ a lever, conceiving it as a mathematical lineinſlexible, without reſlecting how it is inflexible for the very source oſ this indispensable quality furnishes the mechanical connection between the remote pressures and the fulerum; and this supplies the demonstration (without the least difſiculty) oſ the desperate caso nſ a straight lever urged by parallel ſorces. See RoraroN. and many other most delicate problems oſ his art. He also learns, ſrom this proposition, how to ascertain the strains that are produced, without his intention, by pieces which he intended ſor other offices, and which, by their transverse action, put his work in hazard. In short, this proposition is the key to the science oſ his art. We would now counsel the artist, aſter he has made the tracing oſ the strains and thrusts through the various parts of a ſrame ſfamiliar to his mind, and even amused himsel? with some complicated fancy framings, to read over with care the articles STaENGTH OP MATERIALS and Roor. He will now conceive its doctrines much more clearly than when he was considering them as abstract theories. The mutual action of the woody fibres will now be easily comprehended, and his confidence in the results will bæ greatly increased. 508. There is a proposition (see the article Roor) which has been called in question by several very intelligent persons; and they say that Belidor has demonstrated, in his SciENCE DES INGENIEURS, that a beam firmly fixed at both ends is not twice as strong as when simply lying on the props, and that its strength is increased only in the proportion oſf 2 to 3; and they support this determination by a list oſ experiments recited by Belidor, which agree precisely with it. Belidor also says, that Pitot had the same result in his experiments. These are respectable authorities; but Belidors reasoning is any thing hut demonstration; and his experiments are deseribed in such an imperſeet manner, that we cannot build much on them. It is not said in what manner the battens were secured at the ends, any ſarther than that it was by chevalet. IF by this word is meant à tressle, we cannot conceive how they were employed; hut we see it sometimes used ſfor a wedge or key. Iſ the battens were wedged in the holes, their resistance to fracture may be made what we please: they may be loose, and thereſore resist little more than when simply laid on the props. They may be (and probably vere) veqęęq very ſust, and bruised or erippled. Our proposition mentioned distinetly the security given to the ends oſ the hbeams. They were mortised into remote posts. Our precise meaning was, that they were simply kept from rising by these mortises, hut at full liberty to bend up hetween E and I, and hetween G and E. Our assertion was not made ſrom theory alone (although we think the reasoning incontrovertible), but was ugreeable to numerous experiments made in those precise circumstancess Had we mortised the beams firmly into two very stout posts, which could not he drawn nearer to each other by bending, the beam would have borne a much greater weight, as we have verified by experiment. We hope that the following mode of conceiving this case will remove all doubts. Let LM be a long beam, Plate VI. Fig. 14. divided into 3ix equal parts, in the points D, Ii, A, C, E. Let it be firmly supported at L, B, C, M. Let it be cut through at A, and have compass joints at B and C. Let FB, GC be two equal uprights, resting on B and C, but vithout any conneetion. Let AII be a similar and equal piece, to be occasionally applied at the seam A Now let a thread or wire AGE be extended over the piece GC, and made fast at A, G, and E. Let the same thing be done on the other side of A. If a weight be now laid on at A, the wires AFD, AGE will be strained, and may be broken. In the instant oſ ſracture we may suppose their strains to be represented by A f and A g. Complete the parallelogram, and A ę is the magnitude oſ the weight. It is plain that nothing is concerned here but the cohesion oſ the wires; for the beam is sawed through at A, and its purts are perſectly moveable round B and C. Instead of this process apply the piece AH below A, and keep it there by straining the same wire BHC over 519 it. Now lay on a weight. It must press down the ends of BA and CA, and cause the piece AH to strain the wire BHC. In ſhẽ instant of ſracture oſ the sume wire, its resistances H b nd H c must be equal to Af and A g, and the weight A H which breaks them must be equal to Aa. Lastly, employ all the three pieces FB, AH, GC, with the same wire attached as beforee There can be no doubt hut that the weight which breaks all the ſfour wires must be = a A + hH, or twite Au. The reader cannot but see that the wires perſorm the very same office with the fibres of an entire beam LM held ſast in the four holes D, B, C, and E, of some i right posts. In the experiments ſor veriſying this, by breaking slender bars oſ fine deal, we get complete demonstration, by measuring the curvatures produced in the parts of the beam thus held down, and comparing them with the curvature oſ a beam simply laid on the props B and C: and there are many curious inſerences to be made from these observations, but we have not room for them in this place. 509. We may observe, by the way, that we learn rom this case, that purlins are able to carry twice the load when notched into the raſters that they carry when mortised into them, which is the most usual manner of framing them. So would the binding joists of ſloors; but this would double the thickness of the ſlooring. This method should be followed in every possible case, such as breast summers, lintels over several pillars, &c. These should never be cut off and mortised into the sides of every upright; numberless cases will occur which shew the importance of the maxim. We must here remark, that the proportion oſ the spoces BC and CM, or BC and LB, has a very sensible eſfect on the strength of the beam BC; but we have not yq satisſied our minds as to the rationale oſ this effect. It is undoubtedly connected with the serpentine ſorm of the curve oſ the beam before ſracture. This should be attended to in the construction oſ the springs oſ carriages. These are ſrequently supported at a middle point (and it is an excellent practice), and there is a certuin proportion which will give the easiest motion to the body of the carriage. We also think that it is connected with that deviation from the hest theory observable in Buffon's experiments on various lengths oſ the same scantling. The force of the beams diminished much more than in the inverse proportion oſ their lengths. 510. We have seen that it depends entirely on the position of the pieces in respect of their points oſ ultimate support, and of the direction oſ the external force which produces the strains, whether any particular piece is in a state oſ extension or oſ compressionn. The knowledge of this circumstance may greatly influence us in the choice of the construction. In many cases ve may substitute slender iron rods for massive beams, when the piece is to mct the part oſ a tiee. But we must not invert this disposition; ſor when a piece oſ timber acts as a strut, and is in a state oſ compression, ĩt is next to certain that ĩt is not equally compressihle in its opposite sides through the whole length oſ the piece, and that the compressing foreæ on the abutting joint is not acting in the most equable manner all over the joint. A very triſling inequality in either of these circumstances (especially in the first) will compress the beam more on one side than on the other. This cannot be without the beams bending, and becoming concave on that side on which it is most compressedlc When this happens, the frame is in danger oſ being erushed, and soon going to ruin. It is thereſore indispensably necessary to make use oſf beams in all cases where struts are required of considerable length, rather 2han oſ metal rods oſ slender dimensions, unless in situa- tions where we can eſfectually prevent their bending, as in trussing a girder internally, where a cast iron strut may be firmly cased in it, 50 as not to bend in the smallest degree. In cases where the pressures are enormous, as in the very oblique struts oſ a centre or arch frame, we must be particularly cautious to do nothing which can ſacilitate the compression oſ either sidee No mortises should be eut near to onè side; no lateral pressures, even the slightest, should he allowed to touch itt. We have seen a pillar of fir 12 inches long and one inch in section, when loaded with three tons, snap in an instant when pressed on one side by I6 pounds, while another hore 44 tons without hurt, because it was inclosed (Ioosely) in a stout pipe oſ iron. In such cases oſf enormous compression, it is of great importance that the compressing ſorce bear equally on the whole abutting surfacee The German carpenters are accustomed to put a plate oſ lead over the joint. This prevents, in some measure, the penetration of the end fibres. Mr Perronet, the celebrated French architect, formed his sbutments into arches oſ circles, the centre oſ which was the remote end of the strut. By this contrivance the unavoidable change oſ ſorm oſ the triangle made no partial bearing oſ either angle oſ the abutment. This always has a tendency to splinter oſf the heel oſ the beam where it presses strongest. It is a very judicious practice. When circumstances allow it, we should rather employ ties than struts ſor securing a beam against lateral strains. When an upright pillar, such as a ſlagstaſſ, a mast, or the uprights oſ a very tall scaſſolding, are to be shoared up, the dependence is more certain on those braces that are stretched by the strain than on those which are compressed. The scaſſolding oſ the iron bridge near Sunderland had some ties very judiciously disposed, and others with less judgment. We should proceed to consider the transverse strains as affect the various parts oſ a ſframe oſ carpentry; but we have very little to add to what has been said already under the subject of STRENGTE OP MATERIALS, and under the subject of Roor. What we shall add in this article will find a place in our occasional remarks on different works. It may, however, he oſ use to recal to the readers memory the ſollowing propositions. 511. . When a beam AB, Fig. l5. is firmly fixed at the end A, and a straining ſorce acts perpendicularly to ita Ilength at any point B, the strain occasioned at any section C between B and A is proportional to CB, and may therefore be represented by the produet WCB; that is, by the product oſ the number oſ tons, pounds, &e. which measure the straining ſorce, and the number oſ feet, inches, &e. contained in CB. As the loads on a beam are easily conceived, we shall substitute this for any other straining ſorce. 2. I the strain or load is uniſormly distributed along any part of the beam lying beyond C, (that is, further ſrom A). the strain at C is the same as iſ the load were all collected at the middle point of that part; for that point is the centre oſ gravity oſ the load. S. The strain on any section D oſ a beam AB, Fig. 16. resting ſreely on two props A and B, is AD x DB AB Thereſore, 4. The strain on the middle point, by a force applieũ there, is one-fourth of the strain which the same force would produce, if applied to one end oſ a hbeam oſ the same length, having the other end fixed. 5. The strain on any section C oſ a beam, resting on two props A and B, occasioned by a force applied perpendicularly to another point D, is proportional to the rectangle of the exterior segments, or is equal to ? x (S8ee Roor, and STRENGTE OF MATERIALS.) v x a Thereſore, The strain at C occasioned by the pressure on D, is the same with the strain at D occasioned by the same pressure on C. 6. The strain on any section D, occasioned by a load uniſormly diffused over any part EF, is the same as iſ the two parts ED, DF oſ the load were collected at their middle points e and ſ. Thereſore, The strain on any part D, oceasioned by a load uniformly distributed over the whole beam, is one halſ of the strain that is produced when the same load is laid on at D; and, The strain on the middle point C, ocoasioned hy a load uniformly distributed over the whole beam, is ne same which half that load would produce if laid on 1t C. T. A beam supported at both ends on two props B and C, Fig. l4., will carry twice as much when the ends beyond the props are kept from rising, as it will carry when it rests loosely on the props. 8. Lastly, the transverse strain on any section, occasioned by a ſorce applied obliquely, is diminished in the proportion oſ the sine oſ the angle which the direction of the ſorce makes with the beam. Thus, iſ it he inelined to it in an angle oſ thirty degrees, the strain is one half oſ the strain occasioned hy the same ſorce acting perpendicularly. On the other hand, the RELATIVE 57RENGTH Of a beam, or its power in any particular section to resist any transwerse strain, is proportional to the absolute cohesion oſ the section directly, to the distance oſ its centre of effort ſrom the axis oſ ſracture directly, and to the distance ſrom the strained point inversely. ſThus in a rectangular section oſ the beam, oſ which b is the breadth, d the depth (that is, the dimension in the direction of the straining ſorce), measured in inches, and ſ the numher oſ pounds which one square inch will just support without being torn asunder, we must have  x b x a0, proportional to u x CB, Fig. 15. Or,  x b x dè, multiplied by some number m, depending on the nature of the timber, must be equal to w x CB. Or, in the case of the section C oſ Fig. 16. that is strained by the force of w applied at D, we must have nxſ bar æu x2 Thus it the beam is of sound oak, m is very nearly =  (cee StRENGTH OP MA7ba- AC xCB TERIALS.) Thereſore we have u xD4 Hence we can tell the precise ſorce w which any seetion C can just resist when that force is applied in any way whatever. For the above mentioned ſormula gives v = I I4 for the case represented by Fig. 15. But the case represented in Fig. 16. having the straining force applied at D, gives the strain at C (m u) æ b dè x AB 5ACXCB Exaomple Let an oak beam, ſour inches square, rest ſreely on the props A and B, seven feet apart, or 84 inches. What weight will it just support at its middle point C, on the supposition that a square ineh rod will just carry 16,000 pounds, pulling it asunder? The ſormula becomes w 16000 x à x 16 x B4 86016000 9 x 42 x 42 or u æ C/ = 5418 pounds. This is very near what was employed in Buſſon's experiment, which was 5312. Had the straining ſorce acted on a point D, half way between C and B, the force suſſicient to break the beam at C ould be  u æa  10836 Ibs. Had the beam been sound red ſfir, we must have taken J = I6,000 nearly, and m nearly 8; for although fir be less cohesive than oak in the proportion oſ b to 8 nearly, 7t is less compressible, and its axis of ſracture is thereſore nearer to the concave side. 512. Having considered at suſicient length the strains oſ diſferent kinds which arise from the ſorm oſ the parts oſ a ſrame oſ carpentry, and the direction oſ the external ſorees which act on it, whether considered as impelling or as supporting its different parts, ve must now proceed to consider the means by which this ſorm is to be secured, and the connections by which those strains are excited and communieated. The joinings practised in earpentry are almost infinitely various, and each has advantages which make it preferable in some circumstances. Many varieties are employed merely to please the eyee. We do not concern ourselves with these: Nor shall we consider those which are only employed in connecting small works, and can never appear on a great seale; yet even in some oſ these, the skill of the carpenter may be discovered by his choice; ſor in all cases, it is wise to make every, even the smallest, part oſ his work as strong as the materials will admit. He will be particularly attentive to the changes which will necessarily happen by the shrinking oſ timber as iĩt dries, and will consider vhat dimensions of his framings will be affected by this, and what will not: und will then dispose the pieces which are less essential to the strength oſ the whole, in such a manner that their tendency to shrink shall be in the same direction with the shrinking of the whole ſraming. IF he do otherwise, the seams will widen, and parts will be split asunder. He will dispose his boardings in such a manner as to con- tribute to ſhe stifſess oſ the whole, avoiũing at the same time the giving them positions which will produce lateral strains on truss beams which bear great pressures; recollecting, that although a single board has little ſorce, yet many united have a great deal, and may ſrequently perſorm the office oſ very powerſul struts. l DOur limits confine us to the joinings which are most essential ſor connecting the parts oſ a single piece of a ſrame when it eannot be ſormed of one beam, either ſor want oſ the necessary thickness or length; and the joints for connecting the difſerent sides oſ a trussed ſrame. 513. Much ingenuity and contrivance have heen bestowed on the manner of building up a great beam of many thicknesses, and many singular methods are practised as great nostrums by difſerent artists: but when we consider the manner in which the cohesion of the fibres performs its oſfice, e shall clearly see that the simplest are equally efſectual with the most refined, and that they are less apt to lead us into ſalse notions of the strength oſ the assemblage. 514. Thus, were it required to build up a beam for a great lever or a girder, so that it may act nearly as a beam of the same size oſ one logit may either be done by plain joggling, as in Plate VII. Fig. I. A, or by scarſing, as in Fig. I. B or C. 515. Iſ it is to act as a lever, having the gudgeon on the lower side at C, we believe that most artists will preſer the form B and C; at least this has been the case with nine-tenths oſ those to whom we have proposed the questionn. The best informed only hesitated; but the ordinary artists were all confident in its superiority; and we ſound their views oſ the matter very coincident. They considered the upper piece as grasping the lower in its hooks; and several imagined that, by driving the one very tight on the other, the beam would be stronger than an entire log: but if we attend eare- ſully to the internal procedure in the loaded lever, we shall find the upper one clearly the strongest. Iſ they are formed oſ equal logs, the upper one is thicker than the other by the depth of the joggling or searfing, which we suppose to be the same in both; consequently, if the cohesion oſ the fibres in the intervals is able to bring the uppermost filaments into full action, the form A is stronger than B, in the proportion of the greater distance oſ the upper filaments ſrom the axis oſ the ſracture: this may be greater than the difference oſ the thickness, if the wood is very compressible I the gudgeon be in the middle, the effect, both of the joggles and the scarfings, is considerably diminished; and if it is on the upper side, the scarſings act in a very diſferent way. In this situation, if the loads on the arms are also applied to the upper side, the joggled beam is still more superior to the scarſed one. This will be best understood by resolving it in imagination into a trussed ſrame. But when a gudgeon is thus put upon that side oſ the lever which grows convex by the strain, it is usual to connect it with the rest hy a powerſul strap, which embraces the beam, and causes the opposite point to become the resisting point. This greatly changes the internal actions oſ the filaments, and, in some measure, brings it into the same state as the ſirst, with the gudgeon below. Were it possible to have the gudgeon on the upper side, and to bring the whole into action without a strap, it would be the strongest oſ all; hecause, in general, the resistance to compression is greater than to extension. In every situation the joggled beam has the advantage, and it is the easiest executed. We may ſrequently gain a considerable accession of strength by this building up oſ a beam:; especially iſ the part which is stretched hy the strain be of oak, and the other part be fir. Fir being so much superior to oak as a pillar ſi Muschenbroek's experiments may be confided in), and oak s much preſerable as a tiè, this construction seems to unite hoth advantages. But we shall see much better methods of making powerſul levers, girders, &e. by trussing. Qbserve, that the efficacy oſ both methods depends entirely on the diſſiculty oſ causing the piece between the cross joints to slide along the timber to whieh it adheres. Thereſore, iſ this be moderate, it is wrong to make the notches deep; for as soon as they are so deep that their ends have a force suſſicient to push the slice along the line oſ junetion, nothing is gained by making them deeper; and this requires a greater expenditure oſ timber. Scarſimgs are ſrequently made oblique, as in Fig. 2. but we imagine that this is a bad practicee It begins Lo yield at the point, where the wood is erippled and splintered ofſ, or at least bruised out a little: as the pressure increases, this part, by squeeæing broader, causes the solid parts to rise a little upwards, and gives them some tendency, not only to push their antagonists along the base, but even to tear them up a littlee. For similar reasons, we disapprove oſ the ſavourite praetice oſ many urtists, to make the angles oſ their scarſings acute, as in Fig. 3 This oſten causes the two pieces to tear each other up. The abutments should always he perpendicular to the directions oſ the pressuress Lest it should be forgotten in its proper place, ve may extenũ this injuncetion also to the abutments of difſerent pieces oſ a ſrame; und recommend it. to the artist even to attend to the shrinking of the timbers by dryingg When two timbers abut obliquely, the joint should he most ſull at the obtuse angle oſ the end; bhecause, by drying, that angle grows more obtuse, and the beam would then be in i-ger oſ splintering off at the acute angle. 516. It is evident, that the nicest work ĩs iudispensably necessary in building up a beam. The parts must ahut on each other completely, and the smallest play or void takes away the whole efficacy It is usual to give the butting joints a small taper to one side oſ the heam, so that they may require moderate blows of a maul to force them in, and the joints may be perſectly close when the external surſaces are even on each side oſ the beam. Bul we must not exceed in the least degree; ſor a very taper wedge has great ſorce; and if we have driven the pieces together hy very heavy hlows, we leave the whole in a state of violent strain, and the abutments are perhaps ready to splinter off by a small addition of pressuree. This is like too severe a prooſ ſor artillery; which, though not suſficient to burst the pieces, has weakened them to such a degree, that the strain oſ ordinary service is suſficient to complete the ſracture. The workman is tempted to exceed in this, because it smooths off and conceals all uneven seams; but he must be watched. It is not unusual to leave some abutments open enough to admit a thin wedge reaching through the heam. Nor is this a bad practice, iſ the wedge is oſ materials which arę not compressed by the driving or the strain oſ service. Iron would be preſerable ſor this purpose, and ſor the joggles, were it not that by its too great hardness it cripples the fibres oſ timber to some distance. In consequence of this, it oſten happens that, in bẽams which are subjected to desultory and sudden strains (as in the levers of reciprocating engines,) the joggles or wedges widen the holes, and work themselves loose: Therefſore skilſul engineers never admit them, and indeed as few holts as possible, for the same reason: but when resisting a steady or dead pull, they are not so improper, and are ſrequently used. 517. Beams are huilt up not only to increase their dimensions in the direction of the strain (hich we have hitherto called their depth), but also to increase their hreadil or the dimensions perpendicular to the, strain. voL I. 2L ] We sometimes double the breadth oſ a girder which ĩ thought too weak for its load, and where we must not increase the thickness oſ the ſlooring The mast of a great ship of war must he made higger athwartship, as well as fore and aſt. This is one of the nicest prohlems oſ the art; and proſessional men are by no means agreed in their opinions about it. We do not presume to decide; and shall content ourselves with exhibiting the different methods. 518. The most obvious and natural method is that shewn in Fig. . It is plain that (independent oſ the connection of cross holts, which are used in them all when the beams are square) the piece C cannot bend in the direction oſ the plane oſ the figure without bending the piece D along with it. This method is much used in the French navy; but it is undoubtedly imperſect. Hardly any two great trees are oſ equal quality, and swell and shrink alikee If C shrinks more than D, the feather oſ C becomes loose in the groove wrought in D to receive it; and when the beam hends, the parts ean slide on each other like the plates oſ a coach spring; and iſ the bending is in the direetion æ ſ, there is nothing to hinder this sliding but the bolts, which s00n work themselves loose in the bolt-holes. J 519. Fig. 5. exhibits another methodc The two halves oſ the beam are tubled into each other in the same manner as in Fig. I. It is plain that this will not be aſfected by the unequal swelling or shrinkimg, because this is insensible in the direction of the fibres; but when bent in the direetion a b, the beam is weaker than Fig. 4. bent in the direetion e ſ. Each halſ of Fig. 4 has, in every pert of its length, a thickness greater than half the thickness oſ the beam. It is the contrary in the alternate portions of the halves oſ Fig. . When one oſ them is bent in the direction AB, it is plain that it drags the other with it by means oſ the cross butments oſ its tables, and there can be no longitudinal aliding. But unless the work is aceurately executed, and each hollow completely filled up by the table oſ the other piece, there will he a lateral slide along the cruss joints suſficient to compensate ſor the curvature; and this will hinder the one from compressing or stretching the other in conſormity to this curvature. 520. The imperfection oſ this method is so obvious, that it has seldom been practised: but it has heen combined with the other, as is represented in Fig. 6. where the beams are divided along the middle, and the tables in each half are alternate, and alternate also with the tables of the other half. Thus I, 3, 4, are prominent, and b, 2, 6, are depressedl. This construction evidently puts a stop to hoth sides, and obliges every part of hoth pieces to move together. a b and c d show sections oſ the builtup heam corresponding to AB and CD. No more is intended in this yractice by any intelligent urtist, than the causing the two pieces to act together in ull their parts, although the strains may be unequally distributed on them. Thus, in a built-up girder, the binding joints are ſrequently mortised into very difſerent purts oſ the two sides. But many seem to aim at making the beam stronger than iſ it were oſ one piece: and this inconsiderate project has given rise to many whimisiecal modes oſ taubling and searſing, which we need not regard. 521. The practice in the British dock-yards is somewhat different ſfrom any oſ these methods. The pieces are tabled as in Fig. 6., but the tables are not thin paralIelopipeds, but thin prisms. The two outward joints or visible seams are struight lines, and the table No. l. rises gradually to its greatest thickness in the axis. In like manner, the hollow b ſor receiving the opposite table, sinks gradually from the edge to its greatest depth in the axis. Fig. 7. represents a section oſ a round piece oſ timber built up in this way, where the ſull line EFGH is the section corresponding to AB oſ Fig. G. and the dotted line EGFH is the section corresponding to CD. This construction, by making the external seam straight, leaves no lodgment for water, and looks much ſairer to the eye: but it appears to us that it does not give such firm hold when the mast is bent in the direetion EH. The exterior parts are most stretched and most compressed by this hending; but there is hardly any abutment in the exterior parts oſ these tables. In the very axis, where the abutment is the firmest, there is little or no difference oſ extension and compression. But this construetion has an advantage, which we imagine much more than compensates ſor these imperſections, at least in the particular case oſf a round mast: ĩt will draw together by hooping incomparably better than any of the others. If the cavity be made somewhat too shallow for the prominence oſ the tables, and iſ this be done uniſormly along the whole length, it will make a somewhat open seam; and this opening can be regulated with ihe utmost exactness ſrom end to end by the plane. The heart of those vast trunks is very sensibly soſter than the exterior circles: Thereſore, when the whole is hooped, and the hoops hard driven, and at considerable intervals between each spellwe are confident that all may be compressed till the seam disappears: and then the whole makes one piece, much stronger than iſ it were an original log oſ that size; because the middle has become, by compression, as solid as the crust, which was naturally firmer, and resisted ſarther compressionn. We verified this beyond a doubt, by hooping a built stick oſ a timber which has this inequality oſ firmness in a remarkahle degree, and it was nearly twice as strung as another of the Bàme size. Our mastmakers are not without their fancies and whims; and the manner in which our masts and yards are generally built up, is not near so simple as Fig. 6.: but it consists of the same essential parts, acting in the very same manner, and derives all its eſficacy from the principles which are here employed. 52”. This construction is particularly suited to the situation and office of a ship's mast. It has no bolts; or, at least, none oſ any magnitude, or that make very important parts oſ its constructionn. The most violent strains perhaps that it is exposed to, is that of twisting, when the lower yards are close braced up by the force oſ many men acting by a long lever. This form resists twist with peculiar energy: it is thereſore an excellent method ſor building up a great shaſt ſor a mill. The way in which they are usually built up is hy reducinga central log to a polygonal prism, and then filling it up to the intended size by planting pieces of timher along its sides, either spiking them down, or cocking them into it by a feather, or joggling them by slips of hard wood sunk into the central log and into the slips. N. B. Joggles oſ elm are sometimes used in the middle of the large tables of masts; and when sunk into the firm wood near the surſace, they must contribute much to the strength. But it is very necessary to employ wood not much harder than the pine; otherwise it will soon enlarge its bed, and become loose; for the timber oſ these large trunks is very soſt 5238. The most general reason ſor piecing a beam iĩs to increase its length. This is ſrequently necessary, in order to procure tie-beams for very wide rooſs. Two pieces must be scarſed togetherNumberless are the modes of doing this; and almost every master earpenter has his favourite nostrum. 8ome of them are very ingenious; But here, as in other eases, the most simple are commonly the strongest. We do not imagine that any, the most ingenious, is equally strong with a tie consisting oſ two pieces of the same scantling laid over each other ſor certain length, and firmly holted together. We acknowledge that this will appear an artless and clumsy tieheam; but we only say that it will be stronger than any that is more artificially made up oſ the same thickness oſ timber. This, ve imagine, will appear suſſiciently certain. The simplest and most obvious scarfing, (aſter the one now mentioned) is that represented in Fig. S. No. I. & 2. Iſ considered merely as two pieces of wood joined, it is plain that, as a tie, it has but half the strength oſ an entire piece, supposing that the bolts (whieh are the only connections) are ſast in their holes. No. 2. requires a bolt in the middle oſ the scarſ to give it that strength; and, in every other part, is weaker on one side or the other. But the bolts are very apt to hend hy the violent strain, and require to be strengthened hy uniting their ends by iron plates; in which case it is no longer a wooden tie. The form oſ No. I. is better adupted to the office of a pillar than No. 2.; especially iſ its ends be ſformed in the manner shewn in the elevation No. 3 BY the sally given to the ends, the searf resists an effort to bend it in that directionn. Besides, the ſorm oſ No. 2. is unsuitable ſor a post; because the pieces, by sliding on each other by thie pressure, are apt to splinter oſſ the tongue which confines their extremity. Fig. 9. and IO. exhibit the most approved ſorm oſ a scarf, whether for a tie or for a postt. The key represented in the middle is not essentially necessary; the two pieces might simply meet square theree This ſorm, without a key, needs no bolts (although they strengthen it greatly); but, if worked very true and elose, and with square abutments, will hold together, and will resist bendĩng in any direction. But the key is an ingenious and æ very great improvement, and will force the parts together with perſect tightness The same precaution must be obstrved that ve mentioned on another occasion, not to produce a constant internal strain on the parts by overdriving the key. The ſorm oſ Fig. 9. is by ſar the best; because the triangle oſ Fig. 10. is much easier splintered oſf by the strain, or by the key, than the square wood of Fig. 9. It is ſar preſerable for a post, ſor the reason given when speaking oſ Fig. 8. No. I. & 2. Both may be formed with a sally at the ends equal to the breadth oſ the key. In this shape, Fig. 9. is vastly well suited for joining the parts oſ the long corner posts oſ spires and other wooden towers. Fig. 9. No, 2. difſers ſrom No. I. only by having three keys. The principle and the longitudinal strengih are the same. The long scarſ of No. 2. tightened by the three keys, enables it to resist a bending much better. None oſ these searſed tie-beams can have more than one- third oſ the strength of an entire pieee, unless with the assistance oſ iron plates; ſor iſ the key be made thinner than one-third, it has less than one-third of the fibres to pull by. We are confident thereſore, that when the heads oſ the bolts are connected by plates, the simple form of Fig. S. No. I. is stronger than thosa more ingenious scarſings. It may be strengthened agsinst lateral hendings hy a littl] tongue, or hy a sally; but it cannot have both. 524. The strongest of all methods oſ piecing a tiebeam would he to set the parts end to end, and grasp them between other pieces on each side, as in Fig. l. This is what the ship-carpenter calls sishing a heam; and is a ſrequent practice ſor occasional repairss Mr Perronet used it ſor the tie-beams or stretchers, by which he connected the opposite ſeet oſ a centre, which was yielding to its load, and had pushed aside one of the piers abovæ ſour inches. Bix oſ these not only withstood a strain oſ 1800 tons, but, by wedging behind them, he brought the ſeet oſ the truss 24 inches nearer. The stretcher were 14 inches by 11 of sound oak, and could have with- stood three tſmes that strainn. Mr Perronet, ſearing that the great length of the bolts employed to connect the beams oſ these stretchers would expose them to the risk of bending, scarfed the two side pieces into the middle piecee The searfing was oſ the triangular kind (Irait de dupiter), and only an inch deep, each ſace being two feet long, and the bolt passed through close to the angle. In piecing the pump rods, and other wooden stretehers oſ great engines, no dependence is had on searfing; and the engineer connects every thing by iron straps. We doubt the propriety oſ this, at least in cases where the bulk of the wooden connection is not inconvenient. These observations must suſfice for the methods employed ſor connecting the parts oſ a beam; and ve now proceed to consider what are more usually called the joints oſ a piece of carpentry. 525. Where the beums stand square with each other, and the strains are also square with the beams, and in the plane oſ the frame, the common mortise and tenon is the most perſeet junction. A pin is generally put through both, in order to keep the pieces united, in opposition to any ſorce which tends to part them. Every carpenter Enows how to bore the hole for this pin, so that it shall draw the tenon tight into the mortise, and cause the shoulder to butt close, and make neat work; and he Enows the risk oſ tearing out the bit of the tenon beyond the pin, iſ he draw it too much. We may just observe, that square holes and pins are much preferable to round ones for this purpose, bringing more oſ the wood into ncetion, with less tendency to split itt,. The ship carpenters have an ingenious method oſf making long wooden bolts, which do not pass completely through, take a very Tast hold, though not nicely fitted to their holes, whieh they must not be, lest they should' be erippled in driving. They eall it ſoxtail wedging They stick into the point uſ the bolt a very thiu wedge oſ hard wood, s0 as lo o- jeet a proper distance; when this reaches the bottom oſ the hole by driving the bolt, it splits the end oſf it, and squeezes it hard to the sidee This may be practised with advantage in carpentry. I the ends oſ the mortise are widened inwards, and a thin wedge be put into the end oſ the tenon, it will have the same effect, and make the joint equal to a dovetail. But this risks the splitting the piece beyond the shoulder oſ the tenon, whieh woulũ bæ unsightly. This may be avoided as ſollows: Let the tenon T, Fig. 12 have two very thin wedges a and è stuck in near its angles, projecting equally; at a very small distance within these, put in two shorter ones à, d, and more within these if necessary. In driving this tnon, the wedges o and c vill take fſirst, and split oſſ a thin slice, which will easily bend without breaking. The vedges b, d, will act next, and have a similar effect, and the others in successionn. The thickness of all the wedges taken together must he equal to the enlargement oſ the mortise toward the hottom. When the strain is transverse to the plane oſ the two beams, the principles laid down in the article STnENGTE or MarERIALS, Will direct the artist in placing his mortise. Thus the mortise in a girder for receiving the tenon oſ a binding joist of a ſloor should he as near the upper side as possible, because the girder becomes eoncave on that side by the strain. But as this exposes the tenon oſ the binding joist to the risk of being torn off, we are obliged to mortise farther down. The form (Fig. 13.) generally given to this joint is extremely judicious. The sloping part a b gives a very firm support to the additional bearing e d, without much weakening oſ the girder. This form should be copied in every case where the strain has a similar directionn. 526. The joint that most oſ all demands the careful attention oſ the artist, is that which connects the ends of beams, one oſf which pushes the other very obliquely, putting it into a state oſ extensionn. The most ſamiliar instance oſ this is the ſoot oſ u raſter pressing on the tibeam, and thereby drowing it away from the other wall. When the direction is very oblique (in which case the extending strain is the greatest), it is difficult to give the ſoot oſ the raſter such a hold of thèe tie-heam as to bring many oſ its fibres into the proper aetiun. There would be little difficulty i we could allow the end oſ the tiebeam to project to a small distance beyond the foot of the raſter: but, indeed, the dimensions which are given to lie-beams, ſor other reasons, are always suſficient to give enough oſ abutment when judiciously employed. Unſortunately this joint is much exposed to ſailure by the efſects of the weather. It is much exposed, and ſrequently perishes by rot, or becomes s0 soſt and ſriable that a very small force is suſficient, either ſor pulling thæ filaments out oſ the tie beam, or for crushing them together. We are thereſore obliged to secure it with porticular attention, and to avail ourselves oſ every circumstance of construction. One is naturally disposed to give the raſter a deep hold by a long tenon; but it has heen ſrequently ohserved in old rooſs that such tenons break off. Frequently they are observed to tear up the wood that is above them, and push their way through the end of the tie-beam. This, in all probability, arises from the first ſfagging of the rooſ, by the compression oſ the raſters and oſ the head oſ the king post. The head oſ the raſter descends, the angle with the tie-beam is diminished by the raſter revolving round ils step in the tie-beam. By this motion the heel or inner angle oſ the raſter becomes a fulerum to a very long and powerſul lever much loaded. The tenon is the other arm, very short, and being still ſresh, it is therfore very powerſul. It thereſore forces up the wood that is above it, tearing it out ſrom between the chees oſ the mortise, and then pushes it along Corpenters hav thereſore given up long tenons, and give to the toe oſ the tenon a shape which abuts ſirmly, in the direction oſ the thrust, on the solid hottom oſf the mortise, which is well supportæd on the under side hy the wail-plate, This form has the farther advantage of having no tendency to tear up thie end of the mortise. It is represented in Pig: 14. The tenon has a small portion a b cut perpendicular to the surſace oſ the tie-beam, and the rest b o is perpendiculur to the raſter. But if the tenon is not sufſiciently strong (and it is not s0 strong as the raſter,, which is thought not to be stronger than is necessary), it will be crushed, and then the raſter will shade out along the surſace oſ the beam, ĩIt is therefore necessary to call in the assistance of the wholè raſter. It is in this distribution oſ the strain among the various abutting parts that the varieties oſ joints and their merits chieſly consist. It would be endless to describe every nostrum, and we shall only mention a few that are most generally approved oſ. 527. The aim in Fig. 15. is to make the abutments exnctly perpendicular to the thrusts. It does this very precisely; and the share which the tenon and the shoulder have oſ the whole may be what we please, by the portion oſ the heom that wo noteh down. Iſ the wall-plate lie duly beſore the heel of the raſter, there is no risk of straining the tie across or breaking it, because the thrust is made direet to that point where the beam is supported. The action is the same as against the joggle on the head or ſoot of a king-post. We have no doubt but that this is a very efſectual joint. It is not, however, much practised. It is said that the sloping seam at the shoulder Iodges water; but the great reason seems to be a secret motion that it weakens the tie-beam. IF we consider the direction in which it ucts as a tie, ve must acknowledge that this ſorm takes the best method for bringing the whole oſ it into a-tion. Fig. 16. exhiliits a ſorm that is more general, but certainly worsee What part oſ ihe thrust ihat is not borne by the tenon acts obliquely on the joint oſ the shoulder, and gives the whole a tendeney to rise up and slide out vard. The shoulder joint is sometimes ſformed like the dotted line a b e d e ſ& of Fig. 16. This is much more agreenble to the true principle, and would be a very perſeet method, were it not that the intervals b d and d f are s short that the little wooden triangles b c d, d e f, will be enasily pushed off their bases b d, d &. Pig. I7. seems to have the most general approhation. It is the joint recommended by Price, and copied into all books of earpentry as the true joint ſer a raſter foot. The visible shoulder-joint is ſlush with the upper surface oſ the tie-heam. The angle oſ the tenon at the tie nearly bisects the obtuse angle formed by the raſter and the heam, and is thereſore somewhat oblique to the thrust. The inner shoulder a c is nearly perpendicular to b d The lower angle oſ the tenon is eut ofſ horizontally as at e d. Fig. 18. is a section oſ the beam and raſter ſoot, shewing the difſerent shoulders. We do not pereeive the peculiar merit oſ this joint. The efſect oſ the three oblique abutments o b, à c, e d, is undoubtedly to make the whole bear on the outer end oſ the mortise, and there is no other part oſ the tie-beam that makes immediate resistancee Its only advantage over a tenon extending in the direction oſ the thrust is, that it will not tear up the wood above it. Had the inner shoulder had the form e c i, having its ſace i o perpendicular, it would certainly have acted more powerſully in stretching many filaments of the tie-beam, and would have had much less tendency to force out the end of the mortise. The little bit c : would have prevented the sliding upwards along e c. At any rute, the joint a b be- ing ſlush with the beam, prevents any sensiblè abutment on the shoulder æ e Fig. 17. No. . is a simpler, and, in our opinion, a preſerable joint. We ohserve it practised by the most eminent carpenters ſor all oblique thrusts; but it surely employs less of the cohesion oſ the tie-beam than might be used without weakening it, at least when it is supported on the other side by the wall-plate. Fig. 17. No. 3. is also much practised by the ſirst carpenters. Fig. 19. is proposed by Mr Nicholson as preſerable to Fig. 17. No. 3. because the abutment oſ the inner part is better supported. This is eertainly the case; but it supposes the whole raſter to go to the hottom oſ the socket, and the beam to be thicker than the raſter. Some may think that this will weaken the beam too much, when it is no broader than the raſter is thick; in which case they think that it requires a deeper socket than Nicholson has given itt. Perhaps the advantages oſ Nicholson's construction may be had hy a joint like Fig. 19. No. 2. 528. Whatever is the form of these butting joints, great care should be taken that all parts hear alike, and the artist will attend to the magnitude oſ the different surſaces. In the general compression, the greater surſaces will. be less compressed, and the smaller will thereſore change most. When all has settled, every part should be equally elose Because great logs are moved with difficulty, it is very troublesome to try the joint ſrequently to see how the parts fit; thereſore we must expect less accuracy in the interior partss. This should make us preſer those joints whose eſſficacy depends chieſly on the visible joint. It appears ſrom all that we have said on this subject, that a very small part oſ the eohesion oſ the tie-beam is suſſicient ſor withstanding the horizontal thrust oſ a roof, even though very low pitched. If, thereſore, no other use is made oſ the tie-beam, one much slenderer may le used, and blocks may be firmly fixed to the ends, on which the raſters might ahut, as they do on the joggles on the head and ſoot of a king-post. Although a tie-hieam has commonly ſloors or ceilings to carry, and sometimes the workshops and store-rooms of a theatre, and thereſore requires a great scantling, yot there frequently occur in machines and engines very ohlique stretchers, which have no other office, and are generally made oſ& dimensions quite inadequate to their situation, oſten containing ten times the necessory quantity oſ timber. It is thereſore oſ importance lo aseertain the most perſect manner of executing such a joint. We have directed our attention 10 the principles that are really concerned in the effeet. In all hazardous cases, the carpenter calls in the assistance oſ iron straps; and they are frequently necessary, even in rooſs, notwithstanding this superabundant strength oſ the tie-beam. But this is generally owing to bad construetion oſ the wooden joint, or to the ſailure oſ it hy time. Straps will be considered in their place. There needs but little to be said of the joinis at a joggle worked out oſ solid timber; they are not near difficult as the last. When the size oſ a log will allow the joggle to receive the whole breadth oſ the abutting brace, it ought eertainly to be made with a square shoulder; or, which is still better, an arch oſ a circle, having the other end oſ the brace ſor its centre. Indeed this in general will not sensibly differ from a straight line perpendicular to the bruce. By this circular ſorm, the settling oſ the rooſ makes no change in the abutment; but when there is not sufficient stuſf for this, we must avoid bevel joints at the shoulders, hecause these always tend to make the brace slide oſ. The brace in Fig. 20. must not be joined as at a, but as at b, or some equivalent manner. Observe the joints at the head of the main post of Drury Lane Theatre, Fig. D. 580. When the very ohlique aetion oſ one side oſ a ſrame oſ carpentry does not extend but compress the piece on which it abuts (as in Plate VI. Fig. 11.), there is no diſficulty in the joint. Indeed a joining is unnecessary, and it is enough that the pieces abut on each other; and we have only to take care that the mutual pressure be equally borne by all the parts, and that it do not produce lateral pressures, which may cause one oſ the pieces to slide on the butting joint. A very slight mortise and tenon ĩs sufficient at the joggle oſ a king-post with a raſter or straining beam. It is best, in general, to make the butting plain, biseeting the angle formed by the sides, or elsæ perpendicular to one oſ the pieces. In Fig. 20. No. 2. whero the straining beam a b cannot slip away from the pressure, the joint a is preſerable to b, or indeed to any uneven joint, which never ſails to produce very unequal pressures on the different parts, by which some are erippled, others aore splintered off, be. 580. When it is necessary to employ iron straps for strengthening a joint, a considerable attention is necessary, that ve may place them properly. The first thing to be determined is the direction oſ the strain. This is learned by the observations in the beginning oſ this articlee. We must then resolve this strain into æ strain parullel to each piece, and another perpendicular to it. Then the strap which is to be made ſast to any oſ the pieces must be so fixed, that it shall resist in the direction puarallel to the piece Frequently this eannot he done; but we must come as near to it as we can. In such cases we must suppose that the assemblage yields a little to the pressures which act on it. We must examine what change of shape a small yielding will produce We must now see how this will aſfect the iron strap which we have already supposed attached to the joint in some manner that we thought suitablee. This settling will perhaps draw the pieces away ſrom it, leaving it loose and unserviceable (this ſrequently happens to the plates which are put ſo secure the obtuse angles oſ butting timbers, when their bolts are at some distanee ſrom the angles, especially when these plates are laid on the inside oſ the angles); or it may cause it to compress the pieces harder than before; in which case it is answering our intention. But it may be producing eross strains, which may break them; or it may he crippling them. We ean hardly give any general rules; but the reader will do well to read what is said in the article Roor. He will there see the nature oſ the strap or stirrup, by which the king-post corries the tie-beam. The strap that we observe most generally ill placed is that which connects the foot of the raſter with the heam. It only binds down the raſter, but does not act against its horizontal thrust. It should be placed ſarther back on the heam, with a bolt through it, which will allow it to turn round. It should embrace the raſter almost horizontally near the ſoot, and should he notched square with the back oſ the raſter. Such a construction is represented in Fig. 2l. By moving round the eye bolt, it ſollows the raſter, and cannot pinch and cripple it, which it always does in ils ordinary ſform. We are oſ opinion that straps which have eyebolts in the very angles, and allow all motion round them, nre oſ all the most perſect. A branched strap, such as may at once hind the king-post and the two braces which butt on its foot, will be more serviceable iſ it have a joint. When a rooſ warps, those branched straps ſrequently break the tenons, by afſording a ſulerum in one oſ their holts. An attentive and judicious artist will consider how the heams will act on such oceasions, and will avoid giving rise to these great strains by levers. A skilſul carpenter never employs many straps, considering them as auxiliaries ſoreign to his art, and suhject to imperfections in workmanship which he cannot discern nor amend. We must reſer the reader to Nicholsons CARPENTER AND JoIN- E3s Assinranr ſor a more particular account of the various forms oſ stirrups, sereweũ rods, and other iron work ſor carrying tie-beams, &e. As for those that are necessary for the' turning joints of great engines constructed of timber, they make no part of the art of carpentry. 581. Aſter having attempted to give a systematic view of the principles of ſraming earpentry, we shall conclude, by giving some examples which will jilihuis and confirm the foregoing principles. 532.

This is a beautiſul roof, and contains less timber than most others oſ the same dimensions. The parts are all disposed with great judlgment. Perhaps the iron rod is unnecessary; but it adds great stifſness to the whole. The iron straps at the raſter ſeet would have had more effect if not so oblique. Those.at the head oſ the posts are very efſective. We may observe, however, that the joints between the straining beam and its braces are not oſ the best kind, and tend to bruise both the straining beam and the truss beam above it. : vOI.. I. 2u The main beams are trussed in the middſe space with oak trusses b inches squaree. This vas necessary ſor its width of 32 ſeet, occupied hy the carpenters, puinters, &e. The great space between the trusses afſords good store- rooms, dressing-rooms, &c It is probable that this roof has not ils equal in the world ſor lightness, stiſſness, and strength. The main truss is so judiciously ſframed, that each of them will saſely heur a load oſ near S300 tons; so it is not likely that they will ever be quarter loaded. The division oſ the whole into three parts makes the exterior roofings very light The strains are admirably kept from the walls, and the walls are even firmly bound together by the rooſ. They also take off the dead weight ſfrom the main truss one- third. 536. The intelligent reader will perceive that all these rooſs are on one principle, depending on a truss oſ three pieces and a straight tie-beam. This is indeed the great principle of a truss, and is a step beyond the rooſ with two raſters and a king-post. It admits oſf much greater variety oſ forms, and oſ greater extentt. è may see that even the middle part may be carried to any space, and yet be ſlat at top; for the truss beam may be supported in the middle by an inverted king-post (oſ timber, not iron), carried by iron or wooden ties from its extremities: And the same ties may carry the horizontal tiebeam K; fſor till  be torn asunder, orM, M, and P he crippled, nothing can ſail The roof oſ St Martin's chureh in the Fields, is constructed on good principles, and every piece properly disposed. But although its span does not exceed 40 ſeet from column to column, it contains more timber in a truss than there is in one oſ Drury Lane theatre The roof of the chapel at Greenwich, that of St Pauſ's, Covent Garden, that oſ Birmingham, and that of Drury Lane theatres, form a series gradually more perſect. Such specimens aſford excellent lessons to the artists. We thereſore account them a useſul present to the. publie. 537. There is a very ingenious project offered to the public by Mr Nicholson (Carpenter's Assistant, p. 68.) He proposes iron rods for king:posts, queen- posts, and all other situations where beams perfſorm the office of ties. This is in prosecution oſ the notions which we have given in the article Roor. He receives the feet of the braces and struts in a socket very well conneeted with the feet oſ his iron king-post; and he secures the foot oſ hia queen-posts ſfrom bheing pushed inwards, hy interposing a straining æill. He does not even morlise the ſoot oſ his principal raſter into the end oſ the tie-beam, but sets it in a socket like a shoe, at the æend oſ an iron har, which is bolted into the tie-beam a good way hack. All the parts are ſormed and disposed with the precision of a person thoroughly acquainted with the subject; and we have not the smallest doubt oſf the success oſ the projeet, and the complete security and durability oſ his rooſs, and we expect to see many of them executed We abound in iron, hut we must send abroad ſor building timber. This is therefore a valuable project; at the same time, however, let us not over-rate its value Iron is but about I2 times stronger than red fir, and is more than I2 times heavier; nor is it cheaper; weight ſor weight, or strength for strength. Our illustrations and examples have been chieſly taken from rooſs, because they are the most ſumiliar instances of the difficult problems oſ the artt. We could have wished ſor more room æven on this subject. The construetion oſ dome rooſs has been (ve think) mistaken, and the diſſiculty is much less than is imaginedl. We mean in respect of strength; ſor we grant that the obliquity of the joints, and a general intricacy, increases the trouble of workmauship exceedingly. 535. Wooden bridges ſorm another class equally diſficult and important; but our limits are already overpassed, and will not admit them. The principle on which they should all be constructed, without exception, is that of a truss, avoiding all lateral bearings on any of the timbers. In the application of this principle, we must ſarther remark, that the angles oſ our truss should be as acute as possible; thereſore we should make it oſ as few and as long pieces as we can, taking care to prevent the bending oſ the truss beams by bridles, which embrace them, hut without pressing them to either sidee When mhe truss consists of many pieces, the angles are very obtuse; and the thrusts increase nearly in the duplicate proportion oſ the number of angless. The proper maxims vill readily occur to the artist who considers with attention the specimens oſ centres or coombs, which we shall give when treating the subject oſ CENTRES. 639. With respect to the ſrames oſ carpentry which oceur in engines and great machines, the varieties are such that it would require a volume to treat of them properly. The principles are already laid down; and if the reader be really interested in the study, he will engage in it with seriousness, and cannot ſail of being instrueted. We recommend to his consideration, as a specimen oſ what may be done in this way, the working beam oſ Hornblower's steam-engine. When the beam must act by chains hung ſrom the upper end oſ arch heads, the ſraming there given seems very scientifically constructed; at the same time, we think that a strap oſ wrought iron, reaching the whole length oſ the upper bar, would be vastly preſerable to those partial plates which the engineer has put there, ſor the bolts will soon work loose. But when arches are not necessary, the ſorm employed by Mr Waitt is vastly preſerable, both ſor simplicity and for strength. It consists of a simple beam AB (Fig. b.) having the gudgeon C on the upper side. The two piston rods are attached to wrought iron joints A and B. Two strong struts DC, EC, rest on the upper side oſ the gudgeon, and carry an iron string ADEB, consisting oſ three pieces, connected with the struts by proper joints oſ wrought iron. A more minute description is not needed ſor a clear conception of the principlee No part oſ this ĩs exposed to a cross strain; even the beam AB might be sawed through at the middlee The iron string is the only part which is stretched; for AC, DC, EC, BC, are all in a state of compressionn. We have made the angles equal, that all may be as great as possible, and the pressure on the struts and strings a minimum. Mr Watt makes them much lower, as A de B, or A?. B. But this is ſor economy, because the strength is almost insuperablee It might be made with wooden strings; but the workmanship of the joints would more than compensate the cheapness of the materials. 540. We ofſer this article to the public with deſerence, and we hope ſor an indulgent reception of our essay on a subject which is in a manner new, and would require much study. We have bestowed our chieſ attention on the strength oſ the construction, because it is here that persons oſ the profession have the most scanty inſormation. We beg them not to consider our observations as too refined, and that they will study them with care. One principle runs through the whole; and when that is clearly conceived and ſamiliar to the mind, we venture to say that the practitioner will find it oſ easy application, and that he will improve every perſormance by a continual reſerence to it. ROOV. B41. Tur word Roor expresses the covering oſ a house or building, by which its inhabitants or contents are protected from the injuries oſ the weather. The Greeks, who have perhaps excelled all nations in taste, and who have given the most perſect model oſ architectonie ordonnance within a certain limit, never erected a building which did not exhibit the roof in the distinetèst manner; and though they borrowed much of their model from the orientals, as will be evident to any one who compares their architecture with the ruins of Persepolis, and oſ the tomh: in the mountains of Sheeraz, they added that form oſ rooſ which their own climate taught them was necessary for sheltering them ſrom the rains. The rooſs in Persia and Arabia are ſlat, but those of Greece are without exception iloping. It seems thereſore a gross violation of the truè principles oſ taste in architecture (at least in the regions oſ Europe), to take away or to hide the rooſ of a house; and it must be ascribed to that rage for novelty which is 30 powerſul in the minds oſ the richh Our ancestors seemed to be oſ a very difſerent opinion, and turned their attention to the ornamenting of their rooſs as much as any other part oſ a building. They showed them in the most conspicuous manner, running them up to a great height, broke them into a thousand ſanciful shapes, and stuek them fſull oſ highly drèssed windows. We laugh at this, and call it Gothic and clumsy; and our great architects, not to offend any more in this way, conceal the rooſ altogether hy parapets, balustrades, and other contrivances. Our ſoreſathers certninly did offend against the maxims oſ true taste, vhen they enriched a part of a house with marks of elegant hubitation, which every spectator must know to he a cunibersome garret: but their successors no less ofſend, vho take oſ the cover oſ the house altogether, and make it impossible to know whether it is not a mere screen or colonnade we are looking at. . bà”]. We cannot help thinking that Sir Christopher Wren erred when he so industriously concealed the rooſ of St Paul's chureh in London. The whole oſ the upper order is a mere screen. Such a quantity oſf wall would have been intolerably ofſensive, had he not given it some appearance oſ hubitation by the mock windows or niches. Even in this state it is gloomy, and it is odd, and is a puzzle to every spectator.There should be no puzzle in the design oſ a building any more than in a discourse. It has heen said that the double rooſ of our great churches which have aisles is an incongruity, looking like a house standing on the top oſ another house. But there is not the least occasion for such a thought. We know that the uisle is a shed, a cloisterr. Suppose only that the lower roof or shed is hidden hy a balustrade, it then hecomes a portico, against which the connoisseur has no objection: yet there is no difſerence; for the portico must have a cover, otherwise it is neither a shed, cloister, nor portico, uny more than a building without a rooſ is a houses. A house without a visible rooſ is like a man abroad without his hat; and we may add, that the whim oſ concealing the chimnies, now so fashionable, changes a house to æ barn or storehouse A house should not he a copy of any thing. It has a title to be an original; and a screen- like house and a pillar- like candlestick are similar solecisms in taste. 513. The orehitect is anxious to present a fine object, and a very simple outline discusses all his concerns with the roof. He leaves it to the carpenter, whom he fſrequently puzæzles (by his arrangements) with coverings almost impossible to execute. Indeed it is seldom that the idea oſ a rooſ is admitted by him into his great compositions; or if he does introduce it, it is from mere affectation, and we may say pedantry. A pediment is ſfrequently stuck up in the middle oſ a grand ſront, in a situation where a roof cannot perſorm its oſfice; for the rain that is supposed to ſlow down its sides must be received on the top oſ the level buildings which flank it. This is a maniſest. incongruit. The tops of dressed windows, triſling porches, and sometimes a projeeting portico, are the only situations in which we see the figure of a rooſ correspond with iĩts office. Having thus lost sight oſ the principle, it is not surprising that the draughtsman (ſor he should not he called architect) runs into every whim: and we see pediment within pediment, a round pediment, a hollow pediment, and the greatest oſ all absurdities, a broken pediment. Nothing could ever reconcile us to the sight of a man with a hat without its crown, because we eannot overlook the use oſ a hat. 544. But when one builds a house, ornament alone will not do. We must have a cover; and the enormous expence and other great inconveniences which attend the concealment of this cover hy parapets, balustrades, and screens, have obliged architects to consider the pent roof as admissible, and to regulate its ſorm. Any man of sense, not under the inſluence oſ prejudice, would be determined in this by its fitness ſor answering its purpose. A high pitched rooſ will undoubtedly shoot off the rains and snows better than one oſ a lower pitch. The wind will not so easily blow the dropping rain in between the slates, nor will it have so mueh power to strip them off A high pitched rooſ will exert a smaller thrust on the walls, both because its strain is less horizontal, and because it will admit oſ lighter covering. But it is more expensive, because there is more oſf it. It requires a greater size oſ timbers to make it equally strong, and it exposes a greater surſace to the wind. 545. There have been great changes in the pitch of rooſs: our foreſathers made them very high, and ve make them very low. It does not, however, appear, that this change has been altogether the efſect oſ principlee In the simple unadorned habitations of private persons, every thing comes to be adjusted by an experience oſ inconveniences which have resulted from too low pitched rooſs; and their pitch will always be nearly such as suits the elimate and covering Our architects, however, go to work on different principless Their proſessed aim is to make a beautiful objectl. The sources oſ the pleasures arising ſrom what we call tuste are so various, so0 complicated, and even so whimsical, that it is almost in vain to look for principle in the rules adopted by our proſessed architects. We cannot help thinking that much oſ their practice results from a peduntic veneration ſor the beautiſul productions oſ Grecian architecture. Such architects as have written on the principles oſ the art in respect of proportions, or vhat they call the oRDONNANCE, are very much puzzled to make a chain of reasoning; and the most that they have made oſ the Greek architecture is, that it exhibits a nice adjustment of strength and strain. But when we consider the extent oſ this adjustment, we find that it is onderſully limitedl. The whole oſ it consists oſ a basement, a column, and an entablature; and the entablature, it is true, exhibits something oſ a connection with the ſramework and rooſ oſ a wooden building; and we believe that it really originated from this in the hands oſ the orientals, ſrom whom the Greeks ceræ tainly borrowed their ſorms and their dombinations. We could easily show in the ruins of Porsepolis, and among thè tombs in the mountains (which were lonJ prior to the Greek architecture), the fluted column, the hase, the Ionie ànd Corinthian capital, and the Doric arrangement oſ lintels, beams, and raſters, all derived ſrom unquestionable principle The only addition made by the Greeks was the pent rooſ; and the changes made by them in the subordinate forms of things, are sueh as we should expect ſrom their exquisite judgment oſ beauty. But the whole oſ this is very limited; and the Greeks, aſter making the roof a chief feature oſ a house, went no farther, and contented themselves with giving it a slopæ suited to their climate. This we have ſollowed, because in the milder parts of Europe we have no cogent reason for deviating from it; and if any architeet should deviate greatly in a building where the outlinè is exhibited as beuutiful, we should he disgusted; but the disgust, though ſelt by almost every spectator, has its origin in nothing but habit. In the proſessed architeet or man oſ education, the disgust arises ſrom pedantry: ſor there is not such a close connection between the form and uses oſ a rooſ as shall give precise determinations; and the mere form is a mat ter of indifſerence. 546. We should not thereſore reprobate the highpitched rooſs of our ancestors, purticularly on the continent. It is there where we see them in all the extremity oſ the fashion, and the taste is by no means exploded as it is with us. A baronial castle in Germany and France is seldom rebuilt in the pure Greek style, or even like the modern houses in Britain; the high pitched rooſs are retained. We should not call them Gothic, and ugly because Gothie, till ve show their principle to be false or tastelesss. Now we apprehend that it will he found quite the reverse; and that though we eannot bring ourselves to think them beautiſul, we ought to think them so. Tho eonstruetion oſ ithe Greek arehitecture is a transſerence of the practices that are necessary in a wooden building to a building oſ stone.To this the Greeks have adhiered, in spite oſ innumerable difficulties. Their marble quarries, however, put ĩt in their power to retain the proportions which habit had rendered agreeable But it is next to inipossible to adliere to these proportions with ſreestone or brick, when the order is of magniſicent dimensions. Sir Christopher Wren saw this: for his mechanical Enowledge was equal to his tastee. He composed the ſront of St Pauſs church in London of two orders, and he coupled his columns; and still the lintels which ſorm the architrave ure of such length that they could carry no additional weight, and he was obliged to truss them behind. Had he made but one order, the architrave eould not have carried jts oun weight. It is impossible to execute a Dorie entablature of this size in brick. It is attempted in a very noble ſront, the Academy oſf Arts in St Petersburgh. But the architect was obliged to make the mutules, ànd other projecting members of the eomiche, oſ granite, and many oſ them broke down by their own weight. 547. Here is surely an error in principlee Since stone is the chieſ material of our buildings, ought not the members of ornamental architecture to be refinements on the essential and unaſſeeted purts oſ a simple stone-building? There is almost às much propriety in the architecture oſ India, where a dome is made in imitation oſ a lily or other ſlower inverted, as in the Greek imitation oſ a wooden building. The principles oſ masonry, and not oſ carpentry, should be seen in our architecture, iſ we vould have it according to the rules oſ just tast. Now we aſfirm that this is the characteristic ſeature oſf what is called the Gothic architeeturee In this no dependence is had on the transverse strength of stone. No lintels are to be seen; no extravagant projections Every stone is pressed to its neighbours; and none is exposed tò a transverse strain. The Greeks were enabled to execute their colossal buildings only by using immense blocks oſ the hardest materialss. The Norman mason could raise a building to the skies without using a stone which a labourer could not carry to the top on his bàck. Their architects studied the principles oſ equilibrium; and, having attained a vonderſul knowledge of it, they indulged themselves in exhibiting remarkable instancess. We call this false taste; and say that the appearance oſ insecurity is the greatest fault. But this is owing to our habits: our thoughts may be said to run in a wooden trãin, and certain simple maxims of carpentry are ſamiliar to our imagination; and in the careſul adherence to these consists the heauty and symmetry of the Greek architeeture Had we been as much habituated to the equilibrium of pressure, this apparent insecurity would not have met our eye; we would have perceived the strength, and we should have relished the ingeniity. 548. The Gothic architecture is perhaps entitled to the name oſ rational architecture; and its beauty is ſounded on the characteristic distinction oſ our species. It deserves cultivation; not the pitiſul; servile, and unskilled copying oſ the monuments; this will produee incongruities and absurdities equal to any that have crept into the Greek architecture: but let us examine with attention the nice disposition of the groins and spaundrels; let us study the tracery and knots, not as ornaments, hut as useful members; let us observe how they have made their walls like honey-combs; and admire their ingenuity as we pretend to admire the instinct inſused by the great architect into the bee. All this cannot be understood without mechanical knowledge; a thing which few of our proſessional architects have any share of. Thus would architectonic taste be a mark of skill; and the person who presents the design oſ a building would know how to execute it, without committing it entirely to the mason and carpenter. These ohservations are not a digression ſfrom our subject. The same principles oſ mutual pressure and equilibrium have a place in roofs and muny wooden edifices; and if they had been as much studied as the Normans |and Saracens seem to have studied such of them as vere applicable to their purposes, ve might have produced wooden buildings as ſar superior to what we are familiarly acquainted with, as the bold and wonderſul churches still remaining in Europe are superior to the timid productions of our stone architecture The centres used in building the bridge oſ Orleans, is an instanee oſ what may be done in this way. 549. The Norman architects ſrequently rooſed vith stone. Their wooden rooſs were in general very simple, and their proſessed aim was to dispense with them altogether. Fond oſ their own science, they copied nothing from a wooden huilding, and ran into a similar ſault with the ancient Greekss. The parts oſ their buildings which were necessarily of timber were made to imitate stonebuildings; and Gothic ornament consists in eramming every thing full oſ arches and spaundrelss Nothing else is to be seen in their timber works, nay even in their sculpture. 550. But there appears to have been a rivalship in old times hetween the masons and the carpenters Many of the baronial halls are oſ prodigious width, and are rooſed with timber: and the carpenters appeared to have horrowed much knovledge ſrom the masons oſ those times, und their wide rooſs are ſrequently constructed with great ingenuity. Their aim, like the masons, was to throw a roof over a very wide building without employing great logs oſ timber. We have seen rooſs 60 feet wide, without having a piece of timber in them above I0 ſeet long and 4 inches square The Parliament House and Tron Church of Edinburgh, the great hall of Tarnaway castle near Elgin, are specimens oſ those rooſss. They are very numerous on the continent. Indeed Britain retains ſew monuments oſ private magnificence Aristoeratic state never was so great with us; and the raneour oſ our eivil wars gave most oſ the perſormances oſ the earpenter to the ſlames Westminster Hall exhibits a specimen of the ſalse taste oſ the Norman rooſs. It contains the essential parts indeed, very properly disposed; but they are hidden, or intentionally covered, with what is conceived to be ornamental; and this is an imitation oſ stone arches, erammed in between slender pillars which hang down from the principal ſrames, trusses, or raſters In a pure Norman roof, such as Tarnaway hall, the essential parts are exhibited as things understood, and thereſore relished. They are refined and ornamented; and it is here that the inſerior kind oſ taste or the want oſ it may appear. And here we do not mean to deſend all the whims of our ancestors; but we assert that it is no more necessary to consider the members oſ a rooſ as a thing to be concealed like a garret, than the members oſ a ceiling, which ſorm the most heautiful part oſ the Greek architecture. Should it be said that a rooſ is only a thing to keep off the rain, it may he answered, that a ceiling is only to keep oſ the dust, or the ſloor to he trodden under ſoot, and that we should have neither compartments in the one nor inlaid work or carpets on the other. The structure oſ a rooſ may thereſore be exhibited with propriety, and made an ornamental ſfeature. This has been done even in Italy. The chureh of St Maria Maggiore in Rome and several olhers are specimens: but it must be acknowledged, that the forms oſ the principal frames of these rooſs, which resemble those oſ our modern buildings, are very unſit for agreeable ornament. As we have already observed, our imaginations have not been made ſficiently ſamiliar with the principles, and we are rather ularmeũ than pleased with the uppearance oſ the immensæ logs of timber which form the coupes oſ these rooſs, and hang over our heaũs with every appearance oſ weight and danger. It ĩs quite otherwise with the ingenious rooſs oſ the German and Norman architects. Slender timbers, interlaced with great symmetry, and thrown by necessity into figures which are naturally pretty, form ⸗ltogether un objeet which no carpenter can view without pleasurè. And why should the gentleman refuse himsel? the sume pleasure of beholding scientific ingenuity? 551. The rooſ is in fact the part of the building which requires the greatest degree oſ ækill, and where sciencè vill be of more service than in any other partt. The urehitect seldom knows much oſ the matter, and lenves the task to the carpenter. The carpenter considers the framing of a great rooſ as the touchstone oſ his art; ani nothing indeed tends so much to show his judgment anũ his fertility of resource. 552. t must thereſore be very acceptuble to the artist to have a elear view oſ the principles by which this difficult problem may be solved in the best manner, so that the rooſ may have all the strength and security that can be vished for, without an extravagant expence oſ timber und iron. We have said that mechanical science ean give great assistance in this matte. We may add that the framing oſ carpentry, whether ſor rooſs, ſloors, or any other purpose, afſords one oſ the most elegant and most satisfactory applications which can be made o mechanicãl science to the arts of common lifee Unſortunately the practical artist is seldom possessed even oſ the small portion oſ stience which would almost insure his practicœ from all risk oſ ſailure; and even our most experienceũ carpenters have seldom any more knowledge than whut arises ſrom their experience and natural sagacity. The most approved author in our language is Price in his British Carpenterr Mathurin Jousse is in like manner vou. I. ? x the author most in repute in France; and the publications oſ both these authors are void oſ every appearance oſ principlee It is not uncommon to see the works of carpenters of the greatest reputation tumble down, in consequence oſ mistakes ſrom which the most elementary Enowledge would have saved them. 553. We shall attempt, in this article, to give an aecount of the leading principles oſ this art, in a manner so ſamiliar and palpable, that any person who knows the common properties oſ the lever, and the composition of motion, shall so ſar understand them as to be able, on ævery occasion, s0 to dispose his materials, with respect 1o the strains to which they are to be exposed, that he shall always know the effective strain on every piece, and shall, in most cases, be able to make the disposition such as to derive the greatest possible advantage ſrom the materials which he employs. 5564. It is evident that the whole must depend on the Jrinciples which regulate the strength of the materials, relative to the manner in which this strength is exerted, and the manner in which the strain is laid on the piece of matterr. With respect to the ſirst, this is not the proper place ſor considering it, and we must reſer the reader to the article STRENGTEH oF MarERIALS. We shall just horrow ſrom that article two or three propositions suited Lo our purpose. The force with which the materials oſ our edifices, m-0ſs, ſloors, machines, and ſramings oſ every kind, resist Deing broken or erushed, or pulled asunder, is, immediately or ultimately, the cohesion oſ their particles. When 2 weight hangs by a rope, it tends either immediately to hreak all the ſibres, overcoming the eohesion among the porticles of each, or it tends to pull one parcel oſ them Irom among the rest, with which they are joined. This union oſ the ſibres is brought about hy some kind oſ gluten, or by twisting, which causes them to bind each other 30 hard that any one will break rather than come out, so much is it withheld hy frietionn. The ultimate resistanee is therefore the cohesion of the fibre; the force or strength of all fibrous materials, such as timber, is exerted in much the same manner. The fibres are either broken or pulled out ſrom among the rest. Metals, stone, glass, and the like, resist heing pulled asunder by the simple cohesion oſ their parts. The force which is necessary for breaking a rope or wire is a proper measure oſ its strength. In like manner, the ſorce necessary ſor tearing direetly asunder any rod of wood or metal, breaking all its fibres; or tearing them ſrom among each other, is a proper measure oſ the united strength of all these fibress And it is the simplest strain to which they ean be exposed, being just equal to the sum oſ the ſorces necessary for breaking or disengag ing each fibre And; iſ the body is not oſf a fibrous structure, which is the ease with metals, stones, glass, and many other substances, this force is still equal to the simple sum of the eohesive forces oſ each particle which is sephrated by the ſracture Let us distinguish this mode of exertion oſ the cohesion of the hody by the name oſ its AEsoLvTE STRENGTI. When solid bodies are, on the contrary, exposed to great compression, they can resist only to a certain degre]e. A piece oſ clay or lead will be squeeæed out; a piece oſ freestone will be orushed to powder; a heam oſf wood will be erippled, swelling out in the middle, and iti fibres lose their mutual eohesion, aſter which it ĩs easily crushed. by the load. A notion may he ſormed oſ the manner in which these strains are resisted by coneviving a cylindrical pipe ſilled with small shot, well shaken 1ogether, so that each spherule is lying in the closest. manner possible, that is, iſ contact with 5iæ otheĩs in the same vertical plane (this being the position in whiẽh the shot will take the least roim). Thus each- iòuehes the rest in six points: Now suppose them all united, in these six points only, by some cement. This assemblage will stick together and ſorm a cylindrical pillar, which may be taken out of its mould. Suppose this pillar standing upright, and loaded abovee The supports arising ſrom the cement act obliquely, and the load tends either to force them asunder laterally, or to make them slide on each other: either of these things happening, the whole ĩs crushed to piecess. The resistance oſ ſibrous materials to such a strain is a little more intricate, but may be explained in a way very similar. A piece oſ matter of any kind may also be destroyed by wrenching or twisting itt. We ean easily ſorm a notion oſ its resistance to this kind of strain, by considering what would happen to the eylinder of small shot if treated in this way. And lastly, a beam, or a har oſ metal, or a piece oſ itone or other matter, may be broken transversely. This vill happen to a raſter or joist supported at the ends when overloaded, or to a hbeam having one end stuck ſast in a wall and a load laid on its projecting part. This ĩs the strain to which materials are most commonly exposed in rooſs; and, unſortunately, it is the strain which they ure the least able to hear; or rather it is the manner of application which causes an external force to excite the greatest possible immediate strain on the particles. It is against this that the carpenter must chieſly guard, avoiding it when in his power, and, in every case, diminishing it as much as possible. It is necessary to give the reader a clear notion oſf the great weakness oſ materials in relation to this transverse strain. But we shall do nothing more, reſerring him to the article StrENGTE F MarsRIALS. : 556. Let ACDB Plate IX. Fig. I. represent the side of a beam projecting horizontally from a wall in which it is firmly fixed, and let it he loaled with a weight Wa; pended to its extremity. This tends to break it; and the least reflection will convince any person that if the beam is equally strong throughout, it will break in the line CD, even with the surſace oſf the wall. Tt will open at D, while C will serve as a sort oſ joint, round which it will turn. The cross section through the line CD is, for this reason, called the section of fracture, and the horizontal line, drawn through C on its under surface, is called the axis of fracture The fracture is made by tearing msunder the fibres, sueh as DE or FG. Let us suppose a real joint at C, and that the beam is really saved through along CD, and that in place oſ its natural fibres threads are substituted all over the seetion of fracturee The weight now tends to break these threads; and it is our business to find the ſorce necessary ſor this purpose. It is evident that DCA may he considered as a bended lever, of which C is the fulerum: Iff be the ſorce which will just balance the cohesion oſ a thread when hung on it s0 that the smallest addition will break it, ve may find the weight which will be sufficient ſor this purpose when hung on at A, by saying, AC: CD æf:,, and, will be the weight which will just break the thread, by hanging, by the point A. This gives us ? =ſ x Ifthe weight be hung on at a, the foree just sufficieut for breaking the same thread will be =ſ7x In like manner the foree,, which must be hung on at A in order to break an equally strong or an equally resisting fibre at F, must be =f x And s0 on oſ all the rest. If we suppose all the fibres to exert equal resistances at the instant oſ fracture, we know, ſrom the simplest elements oſf mechanics, that the resistance oſ all the particles in the line CD, each acting equally in its own place, ĩs the same as if all the individual resistances were united in the middle point 2 Now this total resistance is the resistunce or strength ſ of each particle, multiplied by the number oſ particless This number may be expressed by the line CD, because we have no reason to suppose that they are at unequal distances. Therefore, in comparing diſſferent sections together, the number of particles in each are as the sections themselves. Thereſore DC may represent the number of particles in the line DC. Let us call this line the depth oſ the beam, and express it by the symbol . And since we are at present treating oſ rooſs whose raſters and other parts are commonly oſ uniform breadth, let us call AH or BI the hreadth oſ the beam, and express it by b, and let CA be called its length, . We may now express the strength oſ the whole line CD by f x d, and we may suppose it all concentrated in the middle point 2. Its mechanical energy, thereſore, by which it resists the energy oſ the weight u, applied at the distance l, is ſ. CD. Cę, while the momentum oſf u is . CA We must therefore have f. CD. Cg.  u. CA, or ſd. 3 d mu. I, and fd: w=@I: à d, or sd: u=2l: d. That is, twice the length of the beam is to its depth as the absolute strength oſ one oſ its vertical planes to its relative strength, or its power oſ resisting this transverse ſracturee. It is evident, that what has heen now demonstrated of the resistance exerted in the line CD, is equally true of every line parallel to CD in the thickness or breadth oſ the beam. The ahsolute strength oſ the whole section of fracture is properly represented by ſ. d. b, and ve still have 2l: d = fdb: w; or twice the length oſ the heam is to its depth as the absolute strength to the relative strength. Suppose the beam I2 ſect long and one ſoot deep; then whatever is its absolute strength, the 2th part oſ this will hreak it iſ hung at its extremity. But even this is too favourable a statement; all the fibres are supposed to meet alike in the instant oſ ſrac- ture. But this is not true. At the instant that the fibre at D breaks, it is stretched to the utmost, and is exerting its whole foreee But at this instant the fibre at & is not 30 much stretched, and it is not then exerting its utmost ſorce. I we suppose the extension oſ the fibres to be as their distance from C, and the actual exertion oſ each to be as their extensions, it may easily be shown (cee STRENGTE OF MaTERIALS); that the whole resistance is the same as iſ the ſull foree oſ all the fibres were united at a point r distant ſrom C by one-third of CD. In this case we must say, that the absolute strength is to the relative strength as three times the length to the depth; s0 that the beam is weaker than by the former statement in the proportion of two to three. Even this is more strength than experiment justifies; and we can see an evident reason ſor it. When the beam is strained, not only are the upper ſibres stretched, but the lower fibres are compressed. This is very distinetly seen, if we attempt to break a piece of eork cut into the shape of a beam: this being the case, C is not the centre oſ ſracturee There is some point c which lies between the fibres which are stretched and those that are compressedl. This fibre is neither stretched nor squeezed; and this point is the real centre of ſracture: and the lever by which a fibre D resists, is not DC, but a shorter one De; and the energy of the whole resistances must be less than by the second statement. Till we know the proportion between the dilatability and compressibility oſ the parts, and the relation between the dilatations oſf the fibres and the resistances which they exert in this state oſ dilatation, ve cannot positively say where the point c is situated, nor what is the sum oſ the actual resistances, or the point where their action may be supposed concentratedl. The firmer woods, such as oak and chesnut, may be supposed to be but slightly compressible; we know that willow and other soſt woòũds are very com- presible These last must therefore he weaher: ſor it is evident, that the fibres which are in a state of compression do not resist the ſracturee It is well known, that a beam of willow may be cut through ſrom C to 5 without weakening it in the least, if the eut be ſilled up by æ wedge of hard wood stuek in. We can only say, that very sound oak and red fir have the centre oſ effort so situated, that the absolute strength is to the relative strength in a proportion not less than that of three and a halſ times the length oſ the beam to its depth. A square inch oſ sound oak will earry about 8000 nounds. If this bar be firmly fixed in a wall, and project about 12 inohes, and be loaded at the extremity with 200 pounds, it will he broken. It will just bear 190, its relative strength being à, oſ its absolute strength; and this is the oase only with the finest pieces; 10 placed that their annual plates or layers are in a vertical position. A langer log is not so strong tnansvemely, hecause its. plates lio in various directions round the heart. 556. These observations are enough to give us a distinct notion oſ the vast diminution oſ the strengih oſ timber when the strain is across it; and we seæ the justice oſ the maxim which we inculeated; that the carpenter; in ſraming rooſs, should avoid as much as possible the exposing his timbers to transvense strainss But this cannot he avoided in all cases. Nay, the ultimatæ strain, arising ſrom the very nature oſ a oof, is transverse. The raſ“ters must carry their own weight, and this tends to hrea them across: an oak heam a ſfoot deep will not carry its own weight iſ it projeet more than 6O ſeet. Hesides this, the raſters must carry the lead, tyling, or slatess We must thereſore econsider this transverse strain a little more particularly, so ſar as to know what strain will he Inid on any part by any unavoidable load, lnid on either æ that. or al any other. B5T. We have hitherto supposed, that the heam had one oſ its ends ſixed in a wall, and that it was loaded at the other end Phis is not an usual arrangement, and was taken merely as afſording a. simple applieation oſ the mechanical principles It is much more usual to have the heam supported at the ends, and loaded in the middle Let the heam FEGH (Fig. 2.) rest on the props E and , and be loaded at its midũle point C with a weight W. It is required to determine the strain at the section CD? It is plain that the benm will receive the same support, and suffer the same strain, iſ, instenũ of the blocks E and G, we substitute the ropes E fe. G h g, going over the pulleys f and g, and loaded with proper weights e and g. The weight e is equal to the support given by the hlock E; ani  iv equal to the support given by G. The sum of e and g is equal to W; and, on whatever point W in hung, the weights e and  are to W in the proportion of DG and DE to GE. Nov, in this state oſ things, it appeans tliat the strain on the section CD arises immediately ſrom the upward action oſ the ropes F f and H h, or the upward pressions of the blocks E and G; and that the office of the weight W is to oblige the beam to oppore this strain. Things are in the same state in respect of strain as iſ a hlock were substituted at D for the weight W, and the weights e and  were hung on at E and G; only the directions will be opposite. The beam tends to break in the section CD, hecause the ropes pull it upwards at E and G, while a weight W holds it down at C. It tends to open at D, and C becomes the centre oſ ſracture:. The strain thereſore is the same as if the hall ED were fixed in the wall, and a weight equal to g, tliat is, to thie half of W, were hung on at G. Eence we conelude, that a heam supported at both ends, buti not fixed there, and loaded in the middle, will carry four times as much weight as it can carry at its exlremity, when the other extremity is ſast in a wall. TThe strain oceasioned at any point L a weight w, hung on at any other point D, is 2/ W æbe EG E x LG. For EG is to ED as W is to the pressure occasioned at GThis would be balanced hy some weight 2 acting over the pulley h; and this tends to break the beam at L, by DE acting on the lever GL. The iii at G is W. EQ and thereſore the strain at L is v. 5  Lo. In like manner, the strain ccasioęa at the point D by the weight W hung on there, is W x j x DG; which is thereſore equal to 3 W, when D is the middle point. Hence we see, that the general strain on the beam arising from one weight, is proportionble to the reeW.DE.DG. tangle of the parts oſ the beam, (ſor 4x is as DE.DG), and is greatest when the load is laid on the middle of the beam. We also see, that the strain at L, by a load at D, is equal to the strain at D by the same load at L. And the strain at L, from a load at D, is to the strain by the same load at L as DE to LE. These are all very obvious eorollaries; and they suſficiently inſorm us concerning the strains which are produced on any part oſ the timber by a load laid on any other part. Iſ we now suppose the heam to be fixed at the two ends, that is, firmly ſramed, or held down by blocks at I and K, placed beyond E and G, or ſframed into posts, it will carry twice as mueh as when its ends were ſree. For suppose it sawn through at CD; the weight W hung on there will be just sufficient to break it at E anũ G. Nov restore the connection oſ the section CD, it will require another weight Ld to break it there at the same time. Thereſore, when a raſter, or any piete oſ timber, is firmly connected with the three fixed points G, E, I, it will hear a greater load between any two oſ them than iſits connection with the: remote point were removed; and iſ it be ſastened in ſour points, G, E, I, K, it will be twice as strong in the middle just as without the two remote connections. ] One is apt to expect ſom this that the joist oſ a ſloor will be much strengthened by being firmly built in the wall. It is a little strengthened; but the hold which gan thus he given it is much too short to be oſ any sensible service; and it tends greatly to shatter the wall, hecause, when it is bent down by a load, it ſorces up the vall with the momentum oſf a long leyerr. Judicious builders thereſore take care not to hind the joists tight in the wall. But when the joists oſ adjoining rooms lie in the same direction, it is a great advantage to make them oſ one piece. They are then twice as strong as when made in two lengths. b58. It is easy to deduge ſrom these premises the strain on any point which arises from the weight of the beam itselſ, or from any load which is uniformly difſused over the whole or. any partt. Ve may always consider the whole oſ the weight which is thus uniſormly diſſused over any part as united in the middle point oſ that part; and iſ the load is not uniformly difſused, we may still suppose it united at its centre of gravity. Thus, to know the strain at L arising ſrom the weight loſ the whole beam, we may suppose the whole weight àcumulated in its middle point D. Also the strain at I, arising ſrom the weight oſ the part ED, is the same as iſ this weight were accumulated in the middle point d of ED; and it is the same as iſ halſ the weight of ED werè hung on at D. For the real strain at L is the upward pressure at G, acting by the lever GL. Now calling e the weight oſ the part DE: this upward pressure will be exd E 3 e x DE E  EG Therefore the strain on the middle oſ a beam, arising ſrom its oWvn weight, or from any uniform load, is the weight of the beam or its load n x DG; that is, half the weight oſf the bsam or load multiplied or acting by the lever DG; tor æ is J. Also the strain at L, arising from the weight oſ the beam, or the uniform load, is 3 the weight of the heam or load acting by the lever LG: It is therefore proportional to LG, and is greatest of all at D. Thereſore a beam oſ uniform strength throughout, uniformly loaded, vill break in the middle. 559. It is of importance to know the relation between the strains arising from the weights of the beams, or ſrom any uniformly difſfused load, and the relative strength. We have already seen, that the relative strength is Jfæq where m is a number to he discovered by experiment ſor every different species oſ materials. Leaving out every circumstance but what depends on the dimensions of the beam, viz. d, b, and' I, we see that the relative strength is in the proportion oſ ⸗ that is, as the breadth and the square of the depth directly, and the length inversely. Now, to consider first the strain arising ſrom the weight of the beam itself, it is evident that- this weight increases in the same proportion with the depth, the breadth, and the length of the beam. Thereſore its power oſ resisting this strain must be as its depth directly, and the square of ĩts lengthi inversely To consider this in a more popular manner, it is plain that the in- crease of hreadth makes no change in the power oſ resisting the actual strain, hecause the load and the absolute strength increase in the same proportion with the breadth. But by increasing the depth, we increaseæ the resisting seotion in the same proportion, and thereſore the number oſ resisting fibres and the absolute strength: but we also increase the weight in the same proportion This makes a compensation, and the relative strength is yet the same. But by inereasing the depth, we have not only increased the absolute strength, hut also its mechanical energy: For the resistance to ſracture is the same as iſ the full strength oſ each fibre was exerted at the point which we called the centre oſ effort; and we showæd, that the distance oſ this from the under side oſf the beam was a certain portion (a halſ, a third, a ſourth, &e.) of the whole depth oſ the beam. This distanee is the arm of the lever by which the cohesion of the wood may be supposed 10 actt. Thereſore this arm of the lever, and eonsequently the energy oſ the resistance, increases in thæ proportion of the depth of the beam, and this rmaina uncompensated by any incrense oſf the strainn. On the whole, thereſore, the power of the beam to austain itæ own weight increases in the proportion of its depth. But, on the other hand, the power oſ withstanding a given utrain applied at its extremity, or to any aliquot part oſ its length, is diminished as the length inoreases, or is inversely as the length; and the strain arising ſfrom the weight oſ the beam also increnses as the length. Therefore the power oſ resisting the strain actually exerted on àt by the weight oſ the beam, is inversely as the square oſ the length. On the whole, thereſore, the power oſ a beam to carry its ovn weight, varies in the proportion oſ its depth directly, and the square oſ its length inversely. As this strain is ſrequently a considerable part oſ the vhole, it is proper to consider ĩt apart, and then to reckon only on what remains for the support of any t extraneous load. l B60. In the next Dlace, the power of à beam to carry nny lond whielv is imiformly diſſused over its length, must be inversely as. the. square oſ the length: for the power of withstanding any strain applied to an ãliquot part of the length (Which is the case here, because the load may be conceived as accumulated at its centre oſ gravity, the middie point of the beam) is inversely as the length; and the octual strain is as the length; and therefore its momentum is as the square of the length. Therefore the power of a heam to carry a weight uniſormly diſfused over it, iu inversely as the square of the length. N. B. It is here undẽrstood, that the uniform load is of some determined quantity for every foot of the length; so that a beam of double length carries a double lond. 5GI. We have hitherto sipposed that the ſorces hieh tend to bireak a beam. transversely, are acting in a direction perpendicular to ihe beam: This is always the case àn level ſloors loaded in any manner; but in rooſs; the action oſ tle load tending to break the raſters is oblique, because gravity always acts in vertical lines. It may also ſrequently happen, that a beam ĩs strained by a ſoree acting obliquely., This modiſication of the strain is easily diseussed. Suppose that the external ſforer, which is measured- by the veight Win Fig. I. acts in the direotion A.w instead of AWI Draw C à perpendicular. to A w. Then the momentum oſ this external ſorce is not to he measured hy W x AC, but hy W xà C. Tlie strain thereſore by. which the fibres in the section oſ ſracture DC are torn asunder, is. diniinished in the proportion of CA to Cã́ that is, in the proportion of radius to the sine oſ the angle CAã, which the. benm makes with the direction oſ the external force. u:i To apply this to our ſiurpose in the most familiar manner, let AB (ig. 3.) be an ohlique raſter oſ a, build- ing, loaded with a weight W suspended to any point C, and thereby occasioning a strain in some part D. We have already seen, that the immediate eause oſ the strain on D is the reaction of the support which is given to the point B. The raſter may at present be considered as a lever, supported at A, and pulled down by the line CW. This ocsasions a pressure on B, and the support acts in the opposite direction to the action oſ the lever, that is, in the direction B b, perpendicular to BA. This, tends to break the beam in every part. The pressure exerted at B is WxAE AE being a horizontal line. ThereAB v s fore the strain at D will be WæA; heam been lying horizonially, the strain at D, ſfrom the x BD. BDD. Had the eigit W suspended at C, would have been æ At is thereſore diminished in the proportion of AC to AE, that ĩs; in the proportion oſ radius to the cosine oſ the elevation, or in the proporiion oſ ihe secant oſ elevation to the radius.  1l It is evident, that this Iaw of diminution oſ the strain is the same whethèr the strain arises ſrom a load on any port of the raſter, or ſrom the weight oſ the raſter itselſ; or ſfrom ãny load uniformly diſſused over its length, provided only that these loads act in vertical lines. 562. We can now compare the strength of rooſs which have diſſerent elevations. Supposing the width oſ the building to be given, and that the weight oſ a square yard of covering is also given. Then, hecause the load on the raſter will incrense in the same proportion with iis length, the load on the slant side BA oſ the rooſ will,be ao the load oſ a similar covering on the halt AF of the ſlat roof, of the same width, as AB to AF. But the transverse action. oſany load on AHl, by which it tends lto break it, is to that of the same load on AF as AF to AB. Tho transverse struin thereſore is the same on hoth, the increase oſ renl load on AB being compensated by the obliquity of ĩts action. But the strengths oſ beans to resist equal strains, applied to similar points, or uniformly diffused over them, are inversely as their lengths, because the momentum or energy of the strãin is proportional to the length. Thereſore the power of AB to wiſhstand the strain to which it is really exposed, is to the power oſ AF to resist its strain as AF to AB. Ir, themfore, a raſter AG oſ a certain scantling ũs just able b carry the roofing laid on it, a ralter AB of the same scantling, but more elevated, will be too weak in the proportion of AG to AB. Therefore steeper rooſs requiræ stouter raſters, in order that they may be equally able to earry a rooſing of equal weight per square yard. To hæ equally strong, they must he made hroader, or placed nearer to each other, in the proportion of their greater length, or they must he mude deeper in the subduplicate proportion of their length. The ſollowing easy construotion will enable the artist not ſfamiliar with computation to proportion the depth oſ the raſter to the slope oſ the Let the horizontal line af Fig. 4. he the proper depth oſ a henm whose length is halſ the width oſ the building⸗ that is, such as would muke it ſit ſor carrying the intended tiling laid on a flat roof. Draw the vertical line ſi, and the line a b having the elevation of the raſter: make ug equal to a f, and describe the semicircle b d g; drav u d perpendicular to a b, a d is the required depth. Thæ demonstration is evident. We have now treated in suſſicient detail what relates the chieſ strain on the component parts oſ a rooſ, namely, what tends to break them transversely; and we haæ enlarged more on the subject than what the present oœcasion indispensably required, because the propositions which we have demonstrated are equally applicable to all ſramings oſ carpentry, and are even oſ greater moment in many cases, purticularly in the construction of machines. These consist oſ levers in various ſorms, which are strained transversely; and similar strains ſrequently occur in many oſ the supporting and connecting parts. 563. We proceed, in the next place, to consider the other strains to which the parts oſ rooſs are exposed, in consequenee oſ the support which they mutually give each other, and the pressures (or ſhrusta as they are called in the language of the house carpenter) which they exert on each other, and on the walls or piers oſ the building: Let a beam or piece oſ timber AB, Fig. 5 be suspended by two lines AC, BD; or let it be supported by two props AE, BV, which are perſectly moveahle round their remote extremities E, F, or let it rest on the two polished planes KAH, LEM. Moreover, let G be the centre of gravity oſ the beam, and let GN be a line through the centre of gravity, perpendicular to the horizon. The beam will not be in equilibrio unless the vertical line GN either passes through P, the point in which the directions of the two lines AC, BD, or the directions oſ the two props EA, FD, or the perpendiculars to the two planes EAH, LBM, intersect each other, or is parallel to these directions. For the supports given by the lines or props ore unquestionably exerted in the direction oſ their Iengths; and it is as well known in mechanics that the supports given by planes are exerted in a direction perpendicular to those planes in the poinis oſ contact; and we Enow that the weight of the heam acts in the same manner as iſ it were all accumulated in its centre of gravity G, and that it acts in ſhe direction GN perpendicular to the horizon. Moreover, vhen a body is in equilibrio between three ſorces, they are acting in one plane, and their directions are either parallel or they pass through one point. The support given to the heam is thereſore the same as VoOL. I. ?o if it were suspended by two lines which are attached to the single point . We may also inſer, that the points of suspension C, D, the points of support E, F, the points oſ contact A, B, and the centre of gravity G, are all in one vertical plane. When this position oſ the beam is disturbed by any external ſorce, there must either be a motion of the points A and B round the centres oſ suspension C and D, or of the props round these points of support E and F, or æ sliding oſ the ends oſ the heam along the polished plane GH and IK; and in consæquence oſ these motions the centre oſ gravity G will go out oſ its place, and the vertical line GN will no longer pass through the point where the directions oſ the supports interseet each other. If the centre oſ gravity rises by this motion, the body will have a tendency to recover ĩts former position, and it will require ſorce to keep it away from it. In this case the equilibrium may be said to be stuble, or the body to have stubility. But iſ the centre oſ gravity descends when the body is moved ſrom the position oſ equilibrium, it will tend to move still Tarther; and s0 ſar will it be from recovering its former position, that it will now ſal. This equilibrium may be called a tottering equilibrium. These accidents depend on the situations oſ the points A, B, C, D, E, F; and they may be determined by considering the subject geometrically. It does not much interest us at present; it is rarely that the equilibrium oſ suspension is tottering, or that oſ props is stable. It is evident, that if the beam were suspended by lines ſrom the point P, it would have stability, ſor it would swing like a pendulum round P, and thereſore would always tend towards the position oſ equilibrium. The intersection oſ the lines of support would still be at P, and the vertical line drawn ahrough the centre oſ gravity, when in any other situation, woult be on that side of P towards which this centre has been moved. Thereſore, by the rules oſ pendulous bodies, it tends to come back. This would be more remarkably thie casæ iſ the points oſ suspension C and D be on the iame side oſ the point P with the points oſ attachment A and B; ſor in this case the new point oſ intersection of the lines oſ support would shiſt to the opposite side, and be still ſarther ſrom the vertical line through the new position oſ the centre oſ gravity. But if the points of suspension and of attachment are on opposite sides oſ P, the new point of intersection mãy shiſt to the same side with the centre oſ gravity, and lie beyond the vertieal line; in this case the equilibrium is tottering. Tt is easy to perceive; too, that if the equilibrium of suspension ſrom the points C and D be stable, the equilibrium on the props AE and' BF must be tottering. It is not necessary for our present purjose t0 engage more particularly in this discussion. It is glain that, with respect to the mere momentary equilibrium; there is no diſference in the support by threads, or props; or planes, and we may substitute the one ſor the otherr. We shall find this substitution extremely useſul, because we eisily conceive distinet notions of the support of a hody by strings. Observe ſarther, that iſ the whole figure be inverted, and strings be substituted ſor props, and props for strings, the equilibrium will still obtain: ſor by comparing Fig. 5. with Fig. 6., we see that the vertiedl line through the eentre of gravity will pass through the interseetion oſ the two strings or props; ũnd this is all that is necessary for the equilibrium: only it must be observed in the substitution of props ſor threads, and of threads for props, that if it be done without inverting the whole figuro, a stable equilibrium becomes a tottering one, and vice versu. This is a most useſul proposition, especially to the unlettered artisan, and enables him to mãke a praetical use oſ problems which the greatest mechanical genitises have ſound no easy task to solve. An instance will show the extent and utility of it. Suppose it were required to make a mansard or kirb rooſ whose width is AB (Fig. 7.), and consisting oſ the four equal raſters AC, CD, DE, EB. There can be no doubt but that its hest form is that which will put all the parts in equilibrio, so that no ties or stays may be necessary for opposing the unbalanced thrust oſ any part of itt. Make a chain a c d e b (Fig. 8.) oſ four equal pieces, loosely connected by pin-joints, round which the parts are perſectly moveable Suspend this ſrom two pins o, b, fixed in a horizohtal line. This chain or ſestoon will arrange itself in such a ſorm that its purts are in equilibrioo. Then we know that iſ the figure be inverted, it will compose the ſrame or truss oſ a kirbrooſ a 7: b, which is also in equilibrio, the thrusts of the pieces balancing each other in the same manner that the mutual pulls oſ the hanging ſestoon a c d e b did. Iſ the proportion oſ the height d ſ to the width a b is not such as pleases, let the pins a, b, be placed nearer or more distant, till a proportion between the width and height is obtained which pleases, and then make the figure ACDEB Fig. 7. similar to it. It is evident that this proposition will apply in the same manner to the determination oſ the form of an arch oſ a bridge; but this is not a proper place ſor a farther discussion. We are now able to compute all the thrusts and other pressures which are exerted by the parts oſ a rooſ on each other and on the walls Let. AB (Fig. 9.) he a beam standing any how obliquely, and G its centre oſf gravity. Let us suppose that the ends oſ it are supported in any directions AC, BD, by strings, props, or planes. Let these directions meet in the point P oſ the vertieal Jine PG passing through its centre oſ gravity. Through G draw lines G a, G b parallel to PB, PA. Then The weight of the heam PG The pressure or thrust at A Ju proportional oſè a The pres:ure at B P. For when a body is in equilibrio hetween three ſorces, these ſorces are proportional to the sides oſ a triangle which have their directions. In like manner, if Ag be drawn parallel to Pò, we shall have l Weight oſ the beam Pæ Thrust on A 3 ropiomi oſ PA Thrust on B BS Or, drawing B parallel to Pæ Weight of heam P Thrust at A J proportional oſ B, Thrust at B PB. It cannot be disputed that, iſ strength alone be considered, the proper ſorm oſ a rooſ is that which puts the whole in equilibrio, so that it would remain in that shape although all the joints were perſectly loose or ſlexiblee. If it has any other shape, additional ties or braces are necessary ſor preserving it, and the parts are unnecessarily strainedc. When this equilibrium is obtained, the raſters which compose the rooſ are all acting on each other in the direction oſ their lengths; and by this action, combined with their weights, they sustain no strain hut that oſ compression, the strain of all others that they are the most able to resiss We may consider them as so many inſlexible lines having their weights accumulated in their centres of gravity. But it will allow an easier investigation oſ the subject, iſ we suppose the weights to be at the joints, equal to the real vertical pressures which are exerted on these points. These are very easily computed: for it is plain, that the weight of the beam AB (Fig. 9.) is to the part of this weight that is supported at B as AB to AG. Thereſore, if W represent the weight oſ the beam, the vertical pressure at B will be W x A and the vertieal pressure AB at A will be W x 5 In like manner, the prop BF being considered as another heam, and f as its centre oſ gravity, and u as it weight, a part oſ this weight, equal F . to u x d is ; at B, and the whole vertical pressure at B is W x G, wx And thus we ſr A ? greatly simpliſy the construction oſf the mutual thrusts of roof framess We need hardly ohserve, that although these pressures by which the paris oſ a ſrame support each other in opposition to the vertical action of gravity, are always exerted in the direetion oſ the pieces, they may be resolved into pressures acting in any other direction which may engage our attention. All that we propose to deliver on this subject at present may be included in the following proposition. Let ABCDE (Fig. 10.) be an assemblage oſ raſters in a vertical plane, resting on two fixed points A and E in a horizontal line, and perſectly moveable round all the joints A, B, C, D, E; and let it be supposed to he in equilibrio, and let us investigate what adjustment of the difſerent circumstances of weight and inclination oſ its different parts is necossary for producing this equilibriumm Let F, G, H, I, be the centres oſ gravity oſ the diſferent raſters, and let these letters express the weights oſ ench. Then (by what has been said above) the weight vhich presses B directly downwards is F x a + G x CG BG 5 hil weight on C is in like manner G x BC + CH EI nx3  nd that on D i H xB 4Ix ſEa be d E be the figure ABCDE inverted, in the manner already described. It may be conceived as a thread ſastened at A and E, and loaded at b, c, and d, with the weights which are really pressing on B, C, and D. It will arrange itselſ into such a form that all will be in equilibrioo. We may discover this form by means oſ this single consideration, that any part b c oſ the thread is equally stretched throughout in the direetion oſ its length. Let us thereſore investigate the proportion between the weight a which we suppose to be pulling the point b in the vertical direetion b⸗ to the weight 3, which is pulling down the point d in a similar manner. It ĩs evident, that since AE is a horizontal line, and the figures A bc d E and ABCDE equal and similar, the lines B2, Cc, Dd, are vertica. Take bf to represent the weight hanging at  By stretching the threads b A and be it ĩs set in opposition to the contractile powers oſ the threads, acting in the directions  A and he, and it is in immediate equilibrio with the equivalent of these two contractile ſorees. Thereſore make b  equal to b f, and make it the diagonal oſ a parallelogram A b i g&. It is evident that b h, b i, are the forces exerted by the threads b A, be. Then, seeing that the thread b c is equally stretched in both directions, make c  equal to hi; c ĩs the contractile ſorce which is excited at c by the weight which is hanging theree Draw & parallel to cd, and Im parallel to be. The ſorce Ic is the equivalent oſ the contractile ſorces c k, c m, and is thereſore equal and opposite to the ſorce oſ gravity acting at C. In like manner, make d n =c m, and complete the parallelogram n d p o, having the vertical line o d ſor its diagonal. Then d n and d ꝑ are the contractile ſorces excited at d, and the weight hanging there musi bæ equal to od. Thereſore, the load at b is to the load at d as b g tod o. But we have seen that the compressing forces at B, C, D, may be substituted ſor the extending ſorces at b, c, d. Thereſore the weights at B, C, D, which produce the compressions, are equal to the weights at b, e, d, whigh a i lb ĩt produce the extensions. Thereſore AF CG CH EI bg: do=F x aB +G x J7 |,C : H X ſ +Ix 4F bE Let us inquire what relation there is between this proportion of the loads upon the joints at B and D, and the angles which the raſters make at these joints with each other, and with the horizon or the plumb liness. Produce AB till it eut the vertical C in Q; drav BR parallel to CD, and BS parallel to DE. The similarity oſ the figures ABCDE and Abe d E, and the similarity oſ their position with respect to the horizontal and plumb lines, shov, without any ſurther demonstration, that the triangles QCB and gbh i are similar, and that B: BC mg i: ih, =nhb: i b. Thereſore B is to BC as the contractile Torce exerted by the thread Ab to that exerted by be; and therefore QB is to BC as the compression of BA to the compression on BC. Then, because b i is equal to cV, and the triangles CBR and c  I are similar, CB: BR c: El, =ck: cm, and CB is to BR as the compression on CB to the compression on CD. And, in like manner, becouse cm = d n, ve have BR to BS as the compression on DC ſo the compression on DE. Also BR: RS æ nd: do, that is, as the compression on DC to the load on D. Finally, combining all these ratios 3DQC: CB=ægb: bi, mgb: e CB: BR=©Ec: kl,  Ic : dn BR: BS =nd: no =dn: no BS: RS no: do = no: do, we have finally QC: RS =gb: o d = Load at B: Load at D. ll Now QC: BC =æb, OBC: ſ, BQTC, æſ, ABC: ſ, ABS BC: BR=ſ, BRC: ſ, BCR, mſ, CDà: ſ, b BC BE: RS æſ, BSR: ſ, RBS, mſ, d DE: ſ, CDE DThereſore QC: RS æſ, AEC. ſ, CD d. ſ, d DE: ſ, CDE. ſ, ABE. ſ, b BC.

Or, the loads are as the sines oſ the angles oſ the joints directly, and as the produets oſ the cosines of the elevations oſ the raſters juintly. Or, the loads at the joints are as the sines oſ the angles at the joints, and as the products of the secants oſ elevation oſ the raſters jointly: ſor the secants oſ angles are inversely as the cosines. Draw the horizontal line BT. It is evident, that iſ this be considered as the radius of a circle, the lines BQ, EC, BR, BS, ore the secants oſ the angles which these lines make with the horizon. And they are also as the thrusts of those raſters to which they are paralle. Thereſore, the thrust which any raſter makes in its own direction is as the secant oſ its elevation. The horizontal thrust is the same at all the angles. For i,,  k2 =m u. = nn =p  Thereſore both walls ure equally pressed out by the weight oſ the roo. We can find its quantity by comparing it with the load on one oſ the joints: Thus, QC: CB æſ, ABC: ſ, ABV BC: BT Rad.: ſ, BCT, æ Rad.: ſ, CB) Thereſore, QC: BT = Rad. x ſ, ABC: ſ, b BA xſ, bBC. 564. It deserves remark, that the lengths oſ the beams do not aſſect either the proportion oſ the load at the different joints, nor the position oſ the raſterss. This depends merely on the weights at the angles. If a change oſ lengith aſſects the weight, this indeed aſſects the form also: and this is generally the casee For it seldom happens, indeed it never should happen, that the weight on raſters of longer bearing are not greater. The covering alone increases nearly in the proportion oſ the length oſ the raſter. Iſ the proportion of the eights⸗ at B, C, and D, are given, as also the position oſ any two of the lines, the position oſ all the rest is determined. If the horizontal distances between the angles are all equal, the ſorces on the diſſerent angles are proportional to the verticals drawn on the lines through these angles ſrom the adjoining angle, and the thrust⸗ ſrom the adjoining angles are as the lines which connect them, Iſ the raſters themselves are oſf equal lengths, the weights at the diſſerent angles are as these verticals and as the secants oſ the elevation oſ the raſters jointly. 565. This proposition is very ſruitſul in its practioal consequences. It is easy to perceive that it contains the whole theory oſ the construction oſ arches; for each stone oſ an arch may be considered as one oſ the raſters oſ this piece oſ carpentry, since all is hept up by ils mere equilihrium. We may have an opportunity of aſterwards exhibiting some very elegant and simple solutions oſ the most diſficult cases oſ this important problem; and ve now proced to make use of the knowledge ve have acquired for the construction of rooſs. 566. We mentioned by the by a problem which is not unſrequent in practice, to determine the best ſorm oſ a kirb-roof. Mr Couplet, oſ the Royal Academy oſ Paris, has given a solution of it in an elaborate memoir in 1726, occupying several lemmas and theorems. Let AE (Fig. 11.) be the width, and CF the height; it is required to construct a roor ABCDE whose raſters AB, BC, CD, DE, are all equal, and which shall be in equilibrio. Draw CE, ani biseet it perpendicularly in H by the line DHG, cutting the horizontal line AE in G. About the centre G, with the distance GE, describe the circle EDC. It must pass through C, because CH is equal to HE and the angles at H are equa. Draw HK parallel to FE, cutting the circumſerence in  Draw CK, cutting GH in D. Join CD, ED; these lines are the rafters oſ half of the roof required. We prove this by showing, that the loads in the angles C and D are equal. For this is the proportion which results ſrom the equality oſ the raſters, and the extent oſ surface oſ the uniſorm roofing which they are supposed to support. Thereſore produe ED till it meet the vertical FC in N; and having made the side CBA similar to CDE, complete the parallelogram BCDP, and draw DB, which will bisect CP in B, as the horizontal line H, bisects CF in Q.. Draw XF, which is evidently parallel to DP. Make CS perpendicular to CF, and equal to FG; and about S, with the radius SF, describe the circle FEW. It must pass through , because SF is equal to CG, and CQ æ QF. Iraw WE, WS, and produce BC, cutting ND in O. The angle WKF at the circumſerence is one half oſ the angle WSF at the centre, and is thereſore equal to WSC, or CGF. It is thereſore double oſ the angle CEF or ECS8. But ECS is equal to ECD and DCS, and ECD is one half oſf NDC, and DCS is one half oſf DCO, or CDP. Thereſore the angle WKF is equal to NDP, and WX is purallel to ND, and CF is to CW as CP to CN; and CN is equal to CP. But it has been shown above, that ON and CP are as the loads upon D and C. These are therefore equal, and the ſframe ABCDE is in equilibrio. A compurison oſ this solution ith that oſf Mr Couplet vill show its great advantage in respect oſ simplicity and perspicuity. And the intelligent reader can easily adapt the construetion to any proportion between the raſters AB and BC, which other circumstances, such as garretroom, &c. may render convenient. The construction must be such that NC may be to CP as CD to cD 55 Whatever proportion of AB to BC is assumed, the point I' will be ſound in the circumſerence oſ a semicircle H Y , whose centre is in the line CE, and having AB: BC æCH: HE, æc :  E. The rest oſ the construction is simple. In buildings which are rooſed with slate, tile, or shingles, the circumstance which is most likely to limit the construction is the slope of the upper raſters CB, CD. This must be suſficient to prevent the penetration oſ rain, and the stripping by the windss. The only circumstance left in our choice in this case is the proportion oſ the raſters AB and BC. Nothing is easier than making NC to CP in any desired proportion when the angle BCD is given. 567. We need not repeat that it is always a desirable thing to form a truss ſor a rooſ in such a manner that it shall be in equilibrio. When this is done, the whole force oſ the struts and braces which are added to it is employed in preserving this ſorm, and no part is expended in unnecessary strains. For we must now observe, that the equilibrium oſ which we have been treating is always oſ that Eind which we call the tottering, and the rooſ requires stays, braces, or hanging timbers, to give it stifſness, or Eeep it in shape. We have also said enough to enable any reader, acquainted with the most elementary geometry and mechanics, to compute the transverse strains and the thrusts to which the component parts oſ all rooſs are exposed. 568. It only remains now to show the general maxims by which all rooſs must be constructed, and the circumstances which determine their excellencee In doing this we shall he exceedingly brief, and almost content ourselves with exhibiting the principal forms, of which the endless variety oſ rooſs are only slight modifications. We shall not trouble the reader with any account of such rooſs as receive part oſ their support from the interior walls, but confine ourselves to the more difficult problem oſ throwing a rooſ over a wide building, without any intermediate support; because when such rooſs are construeted in the best manner, that is, deriving the greatest possible strength ſrom the materials employed, the best construction oſ the others is necessarily includedl. For all such rooſs as rest on the middle walls are rooſs of smaller bearing. The only exception deserving notice is the rooſs of churches, which have aisles separated from the nave by columns. The roof must rise on these But iſ it is oſ an arched form internally, the horizontal thrusts must be nicely balanced, that they may not push the columns aside. 569. The simplest notion oſ a rooſ-ſrame is, that it con3ists oſ two raſters AB and BC (Fig. 12.), meeting in the ridge B. Even this simple ſorm is susceptible oſ better and worse. We have already seen, that when the weight of a square yard of covering is given, a steeper rooſ requires stronger raſters, and that when the scantling of the timhers is also given, the relative strength oſ a raſter is inversely as its length. But there is now another circumstance to be taken into the account, viz. the support which one raſter leg gives to the other. The best form of a raſter will thereſore be that in which the relative strength oſ the legs, and their mutual support, give the greatest product. Mr Muller, in his Military Engineer, gives a determination oſ the best pitch of a rooſ, which has considerable ſingenuity, and has been copied into many books of military education both in this island and on the Continent Describe on the width AC, Fig. 13. the semicircle ACF, and hiseet it by the radius FD. Produce the raſter AB to the cireumſerence in E, join EC, and draw the perpendicular EG. Now AB: AD  AC: AE, and AD x AC , AE a38 and AE is inversely as AB, and may thereſore represent its strength in relution ſo the weĩght actually lying on it. Also the snpport whieh CB gives to AB is as CE, because CE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore the form which renders AE x EC a maximum seems to be that which has the greatest strength. But AE. EC AC: AE æ EC: EG, and EG æ QxC fore proportional to AE.EC. Now EG is a maximum when B is in F; and a square pitch is in this respect the strongest. But it is very doubtful whether this construction is deduced from just principles. There is another strain to which the leg AB is exposed; which is not taken into the account:. This arises ſfrom the curvature which it unavoidahly acquires by the transverse pressure oſ its load. In this state it is pressed in its own direction by the ahutment and load oſ the other leg. The relation between this strain and the resistance of the piece is not very distinetly known. Euler has given a dissertation on this subjeet (which is of great importance, because it affects posts and pillars of all kinds; and iĩt is very well known that a post oſ ten feet long and six inches square will bear with great safety a weight, which would crush a post oſ the same seantling and 20 ſeet long in a minute): but his determination has not heen acquiesced in by the first mathematicianss Now it is in relation to these two strains that the strength oſ the raſter should be adjusted. The firmness of the support given by the other leg is of no eonsequence, iſ its own strength is inſerior to the strain. The force which tends to crush the leg AB, by compress, and is there- ing it in its curved state, is to its weight as AB to BD; as ĩs easily seen by the composition of forees;: and its incurvation by this force has æ relation to it, whieh is oſ intricate determination. It is contained in the properties demonstrated by Bernoulli of the elastic curvee This determination also includes the relation between the eurvature and the length oſ the piecee But the whole of this seemingly simple problem is of much more difficult investigation than Mr Muller was avare oſ; and his rules for the pitch of a rooſ, and for the sally of a dock gate, which depends on the same principles, are oſ no valuee He is, however, the first author who attempted to solve either of these problems on mechanical principles susceptible oſ precise reasoning. Belidors solutions, in his Architecture Hydraulique, are below notice. Reasons of economy have made carpenters preſer a loW pitch; and although this does diminish the support given by the opposite leg ſaster than it increases the relative strength oſ the other, this is not of material consequence, because the strength remaining in the opposite leg is still very great; for the supporting leg is acting against compression, in which case it is vastly stronger than the supported leg acting against a transverse strain. ] 570. But a rooſ oſ this simplicity will not do in most cases. There is no notice taken in its construetion of the thrust which it exerts on the walls. Now this is the strain which is the most hazardous oſ all. Our ordinary walls, instead oſ being able to resist any considerable strain pressing them outwards, require, in general, some ties to Eeep them on foot. When a person thinks of the thinness and heĩght oſ the walls of even a strong house, he will be surprised that they are not blowvn down by any strong blast of wind. A wall oſ three ſeet thick, and 6GO feet high, could not withstand a wind blowing at the rate of 30 feet per second (in which case it acts with a force considerably exceeding two ponnds on every square foot), iſ it were not stifſened by cross walls, joists, and rooſ, which all help to tie the diſſerent parts oſ the huilding together. 57l. A carpenter is thereſore exceedingly careful to avoid every horiontal thrust, or to oppose them hy other ſorces. And this introduces another essenlial part into the construction oſ a rooſ, namely the tie or heam AC, (Fig. 14.), laid from wall to wall, hinding the ſeet A and C oſ the raſters together. This is the sole oſfice oſ the beam: and it should he considered in no other light than as a string to prevent the rooſ ſrom pushing out the walls. It is indeed used ſor carrying the ceiling oſ the apartments under it: and it is even made to support a ſlooring. But, considered as making part oſ a rooſ, it is merely a string: ond the strain which it withstands tends to tear its paris asunder. It thereſore acts with its whole absolute force, and a very small scantling would suffice iſ we could contrive to ſasten it firmly enough to the ſoot oſ the raſter. Iſit is oſ oak, we may saſely subject it to a strain oſ three tons for every square inch oſ its section. And fir will saſely bear a strain oſ two tons ſor every square inch. But we are obliged to give the tie-benm much larger dimensions, that ve may be able to connect it with the foot oſ the raſter by a mortise and tenon. Iron straps are alm ſrequently added. By attending to this office oſ the tiebeam, the judicious carpenter is directed to the proper form oſ the mortise and tenon and oſ the strap. We shall consider both oſ these in a proper place, aſter ve become acquainted with the various strains at the joints oſ a rooſ. These large dimensions oſ the tie-beam allow us o load it with the ceilings without any risk, and even to lay ſoors on it with moderation and cautionn. But when it has a great hearing or span, iĩt is very apt to bend downwards in the middle, or, as the workmen term it, to sway or swag; and it requires a support. The question is, where to find this support? What fſixed points can we find with which to connect the middle oſ the tie-beam? SBome ingenious carpenter thought of suspending it ſfrom the ridge by a piece oſ timber BD (Fig. 15.) called by our carpenters the king-post. It must be acknowledged that there was great ingenuity in this thought. It was also perfectly just. For the weight oſ the rafters BA, BC, tends to make them ſly out at the foot. This is prevented by the tie-heam, and this excites a pressure, by which they tend to compress each other. Suppose them without weight, and that a great weight is laid on the ridge B. This can be supported only by the butting of the raſters in their own directions AB and CB, and the weight tends to compress them in the opposite directions, and, through their intervention, to stretch the tie-heam. Iſ neither the raſters can be compressed, nor the tie-heam stretched, it is plain that the triangle A B C must retain its shape, and that B becomes a fixed point, very proper to be used as a point oſ suspension. To this point, thereſore, is the tie-beam suspended by means oſ the king-post. A common speetator, unacquainted with earpentry, views it very difſerently, and the tie-heam appears to him to carry the rooſf. The king-post appears a pillar resting on the beam, whereas it is really a string; and an iron rod oſ one-sixteenth oſ the sizæ would have done just as well The king-post is sometimes mortised into the tie-beam, and pins put through the joint, which gives it more the look oſ a pillar with the rooſ resting on it. This does well enough in many eases. But the hest method is to connect them hy an iron strap, like a stirrup, which is bolted at its upper ends into the king-post, and passes round the tie-beam: In this way a space is commonly leſt between the end of the king-post and the upper sido voL. I. l àr oſ the tie-beam. Here the heam plainly appears hanging in the stirrup: and this method allows us to restore the beam to an exact level, when it has sunk by the unavoidable compression or other yielding oſ the partss. The holes in the sides of the iron strap are made oblong instead oſ round; and the bolt which is drawn through all is made to taper on the under side; so that driving it ſarther draws the tie-beam upwards. A notion oſ this may be ſformed by looking at Fig. 16. which is a section of the post and beam. It requires considerable attention, however, to make this suspension oſ the tie-heam sufficiently firm. The top oſ the king-post is cut into the ſorm of the archstone of a bridge, and the heads oſ the raſters are firmly mortised into this projecting part. These projections are called joggles, and are formed by working the king-post out oſ a much larger piece of timber, and cutting off the unnecessary wood from the two sides; and, lest all this should not be sufficient, it is usual in great works to add an ironplate or strap oſ three branches, which are bolted into the heads of the king-post and raſters. The raſters, though not so long as the beam, seem to stand as much in need oſ something to prevent their hending, ſor they carry the weight oſ the covering. This cannot be done by suspension, for we have no fixed points above them: But we have now got a very firm point of support at the ſoot oſ the king-post. Braces, or struts, ED, FD, Fig. I17. are put under the middle oſ the raſters, where they are slightly mortised, and their lower ends are firmly mortised into joggles formed on the foot oſ the king-puost. As these braces are very powerful in their resistunce to compression, and the king-post equally s0 to resist extension, the points E and F may be considered as fixed; and the raſters being thus reduced to halſ their ſormer length, have now ſour times their former relative strength. 512. Rooſs do not always consist oſ two sloping sides meeting in à ridge. They have sometimes à ſlat on the top, with two sloping sides. They are sometimes ſormed with a double slope, and are called irb or mansarde rooſi. They sometimes have a valley in the middie, and are then talled M rooſs. Such rooſs require another piece which may be called the truss-beam, because ãll such frames are talled trusses, probably ſrom the French word trousse, because such rooſs are like portions oſ plain rooſs, troussts or shortentd. Aſat- topped rooſ is thus constructed. Suppose that there àre threè raſters AB, BC, CD (Fig. 18.) oſ which AB and CD are equal, and BC horizontal. It is plain that they will be in equilibrio, and the roof have no tendency to go to either sidee. The tie- heam AD withstands the horizontal thrusts oſ the whole ſrame, and the two raſters AB and CD are each pressed in their own direetions in consèquence oſ their butting with the middle raſter or trussbeam BC. It lies between them like the key.stone of an arch. They lean towards it, and iĩt rests on them. The pressure which the truss-beam and its load excites on the two raſters is the very same as if the raſters were produced till they meet in G, and a veight were laid on these equal to that oſ BC and its load. If thereſore the trussbeam is oſ a scantling sufficient for carrying its own load, and vithstanding the compression ſfrom the two raſters, the roof will be equally strong (while it keeps its shape) as the plain roof AGD ſurnished with king- post and braces. We may conceive this another way. Suppose a plain rooſ AGD, without braces to support the middle B and C of the raſterss Then let a beam BC be put in hetween the raſters, butting upon little notches cut in the raſters. Tt ĩs evident that this must prevent the raſters from bending downwards, because the points B and C cannot descend, moving round the centres A and D, without shortening the distance BC between them. This cannot be without compressing the beam BC. It is plain that BC may be wedged in, or wedges driven in hetween its ends B and C and the notches in which it is lodged. These wedges may he driven in till they even ſorce out the raſters GA and GD. Whenever this happens, all the mutual pressure oſ the heads oſ these raſters at G is taken away, and the parts GB and GC may be cut away, and the rooſ ABCD will be as strong as the rooſ AGD furnished with the king-post and braces, because the trussbeam gives a support of the same kind at B and C as the brace would have done. But this rooſ ABCD would have no firmness oſ shape. Any addition oſ weight on one side would destroy the equilibrium at the angle, would depress that angle, and cause the opposite one to rise. To give it stifſness, it must either have ties or braces, or something purtaking oſ the nature oſ hoth. The usual method of ſraming is to make the heads of the raſters butt on the joggles of two sideposts BE and CF, while the truss-beam, or strut, as it is generally termed by the carpenters, is mortised square into the inside oſ the headss. The lower ends E and F oſ the side-posts are connected with the tie-beam either by mortises or straps. This construction gives firmness to the ſrame; for the angle B cannot descend in consequence oſ any inequality oſ pressure, without ſorcing the other angle C to rise. This it cannot do, being held down by the post CF. And the same construction ſortifies the tie-beam, which is now suspended at the points E and F ſrom the points B and C, whose firmness we have just now shown. 578. But although this rooſ may be made abundantly strong, it is not quite so strong as the plain roof AGD of the same scantlingg The compression which BC musi sustain in order to give the same support to the raſters at B and C that was given by hraces properly placed, is considerably greater than the compression of the braces. And this strain is an addition to the transverse strain which BC gets ſrom its own loadl. This form also necessarily exposes the tie-beam to cross strains. If BE is mortised into the tie-beam, then the strain which tends to depress the angle ABC presses on the tie-beam at E transversely, while a contrary strain acts on F, pulling it upwards. These strains however are small; and this construetion is ſrequently used, being susceptible oſ suſficient strength, without much inerease oſ the dimensions of the timbers; and it has the great advantage oſ giving ſree room in the garrets. Were it not for this, there is a much more perſect form represented in Fig. 19. Here the two posts BE, CF, are united below. All trahsverse action on the tie-beam is now entirely removedc. We are almost disposed to say that this is the strongest rooſ of the same width and slope: for if the iron strap whioh connects the pieces BE, CF, with the tie-heam have a large bolt G through it, confining it to one point of the beam, there are five points A, B, C, D, G, which cannot change their places, and there is no transverse strain in any of the connections. When the dimensions of the building are very great, 30 that the pieces AB, BC, CD, would be thought too weak for withstanding the cross strains, braces may be added as is expressed in Fig. 18. by the dotted lines. The reader will observe that ĩt is not meant to leave the top ſlat externally: it must be raised a little in the middle to earry off the rain. But this must not be dope by incurvating the beam BC. This would soon be erushed, and spring upwards. The slopes must be given by pieces of timber added above the strutting heam. 574. And thus we have completed a ſframe oſ a rooſf. It consists oſ these principal members: The raſters, which are immediately loaded with the covering; the tieheam, which withstands the horizontal thrust by which the roof tends to ſly out below and push out the walls; the kingposts, which hang from fixed points and servè to uphold the tie-beam, and also to afford other fixed points on which we may rest the braces which support the middle oſ the raſters; and lastly, the truss or strutting-beam, which serves to give mutual ahutment to the difſerent parts which are at a distance from each other, The raſters, braces, and trusses, are exposed to compression, and must thereſore have not only cohesion but stiſſness. For iſ they bend, the prodigious compressions to which they are subjected would quickly crush them in this hbended state. The tie-beams and king-posts, if perſorming no other office but supporting the roof, do not require stifſness, and their places might be supplied by ropes, or by rods of iron oſ one- tenth part oſ the section that even the smallest oak stretcher requires. These members require no greater dimensions than what is necessary ſor giving suſſicient joints, and any more is a needless expence and load. All rooſs, however complicated, consist of these essential parts, and if pieces of timber are to be seæn vwhich perform none oſ these offices, they must be pronounced useless, and they are ſrequently hurtſful, by producing cross strains in some other piecee In a rooſ properly constructed there should be no such strains. All the timbers, except those which immediately carry the covering, should be either pushed or drawn in the direction of their length. And this is the rule by which a roof should alvays he examined, 575. These essential parts are susceptible oſf numberless combinations and varieties. But it is a prudent maxim to make the construction as simple, and consisting of as ſew parts, as possiblee We are less exposed to the imperſections of workmanship, such as looseæ joints, &e. Another essential harm arises ſrom many pieces, by the compression and the shrinking oſ the timber in the cross direction of the fibress. The efſect oſ this is equivalent to the shortening oſ the piece which butts on the -joint. This alters the proportions of the sides oſ the triangle on which the shape oſ the whole dependss Now in a rooſ such as Fig. 18. there is twice as much oſ this as in the plain pent roof, because there are two posts. And when the direction oſ the butting pieces is very oblique to the action of the load, a small shrinking permits a great change of shape. Thus in a rooſ of what is called pediment piteh, where the raſters make an angle oſf 30 degrees with the horizon, hal? a ineh compression oſ the king-post will produce a sagging oſ an inch, and occasion a great strain on the tie-beam iſ the posts are mortised into it. We would thereſore recommend Fig. 20. as a proper construetion oſ a trussed roof, preſerable to that which is generally used, and the king-post which is placed in it may be employed to support the upper part of the raſters, and also for preventing the strut-beam ſrom bending in either direction in consequence oſ its great compression, It will also give a suspension ſor the great burdens which are sometimes necessary in a theatre The machinery has no other firm poinis to which ĩt can be attached; and the portion of the single raſters which carry this king-post are but short, and thereſore may be considerably loaded with saſety. We observe in the drawings which we sometimes have oſ Chinese buildings, that the trussing oſ rooſs is understood by them. Indeed they must be very experienced carpenters. We see wooden buildings run up to a great height, which can be supported only by such trussing. One oſ these is sketched in Fig. 21. There are some very excellent specimens to be seen in the buildings at Deptſord, belonging to the victualling-oſfice, usually called the ſted House, which were erected about the year 1768, and we believe are the performance oſ Mr James Arrow of the Board oſ Works, one oſ the most intelligent artists in this kingdom. D&576. Thus have we given an elementary, but a rational or acientific, account oſ this important part of the art of earpentry. It is such, that any practitioner, with the trouble of a little reſlection, may always proceed with conſidence, and without resting any part oſ his practice on the vague notions whieh habit may have given him of the strength and supports of timbers, and oſ their manner oſ acting. That these ſrequently mislead, is proved by the mutual eriticisms which are ſrequently published by the rivals in the proſession. They have ſrequently sagacity enoũgh (for it ean seldom be called seience) to point out glaring blunders; and any person who will look at some oſ the perſformances of Mr Price, Mr Wyatt, Mr Arrow, and others oſ acknowledged reputation, will readily see them distinguishable ſfrom the works of inferior artists by simplicity alone. A man without prineiples is apt to consider an intrieate eonstruction as ingenious and effectual; and such rooſs sometimes ſail merely by being ingeniously loaded with timber, but more ſrequently still by the wrong action of some useless piece, which produces strains that are transverse to other pieces, or which, by rendering some points too firm, cause them to be deserted by the rest in the general subsiding oſ the wholee Instances oſ this kind are pointed out by Price in his British Carpenter. Nothing shows the skill oſ a carpenter more than the distineſness with which he ean foresee the changes of shape which must take place in a short time in every rooſf. A knowledge oſ this will oſten eorrect a construetion which the mere mathematician thinks unexceptionable, because he does not reckon on the actual compression which must obtain, and imagines that his triangles, which sustain no eross strains, invariably retain their shape till the pieces breakK The sagacity of the experienced carpenter is not, however, enough without seience for perſecting the artt. But when he knows how much a particular piece will yield to compression in one ease, science will tell him, and nothing but science can do it, what will be the compression oſ the same piece in anothes very ũiſferent case. Thus hè learns how ſar it willl now yield, and then he proportions the parts s0 to each other, that when all have yielded aceording to their strains, the whole is oſ the shape he wished to produce, and every joint is in a state of firmness. It is here that we observe the greatest number of impropriœties. The iron strapi are ſrequently in positions not suited to the actual strain on them, and they are in a state of violent twist; whicli both tends strongly to break ſhe straj; and to cripple the pieces which they surround. In like manner, we frequently seœ joiits or mortises in u state of violent strain on the ſènhons, or on the heeis and shoulderss The joints were perhaps projerly shaped to the primitive ſorm of the truss: hut by its setſling, thè bearing on the push is clianged: the brace, ſor example; in a very low piſched rooſ, comes to press with the upper part oſ the shonlder, and, acting as a powerful lever on the tenon, breaks it. In like manner, the lower eni oſ the brace, which at first buttẽd firmly and squarely on the joggle oſ the king-post, now presses with one corner with prodigious ſorce, and seldom ſails to splinter of on that sidee. We cannot help recommending a maxim oſ Mr Perronet the celebrated hydraulie architect of France, as a golden rule, viæz. to make all the shoulders oſ hutting pieces in the form of an arch oſ a circle, having the opposite end oſ the piece ſor its eentree Thus, in Fig. IS. iſ the joggle-joint B be of this form, having A for its centre; the sagging oſ the rooſ will make no partial bearing at thè joint: ſor in the sagging oſ the rooſ, ſhe piecè AB turns or bends round the centre A, and the counter- pressure of the joggle is still directed to A, as it ought to be We have just now saiil hends round A. This is too frequently the case, and it is always very diſſicult to give the tenon and mortise in this placè a true and invariable hearingg The raſter pushes in the direction BA, and the beam resists in the direction AD. The abutment should be perpendicular to neither oſ these but in an intermediate direction, and it ought also to bæ oſ a curved shape. But the càrpenters perhaps think that this would weaken the beam too much to give it this shape in the shoulder; they do not even aim at it in the heel oſ the tenon. The shoulder is commonly evęen with the surface oſf the beam. When the bearing thereſore is on this shoulder, it causes the foot oſ the raſter to slide along the beam till the heel of the tenon bears against the outer end of the mortise (See Price's EBritish Carpenter, Plate C. Fig. I). This abutment is perpendicular to the beam in Price's book, but it is more generally pointed a little outwards below, to make it more secure against starting. The oonsequence of this construetion is, that when the rooſ settles, the shoulder comes to bear at the inner end oſ the mortises, and iĩt rises at the outer, and the tenon taking hold of the wood beyond it, either tears it out or is itself broken. This joint thereſore is seldom trusted to the strength of the mortise and tenon, and is usually secured by an iron strap, which lies obliquely to the beam, to which it is bolted by a large bolt quite through, and then embraces the outside oſ the raſter foot. Very ſrequently this strap is not made sufficiently oblique, and we have seen some made almost square with the beam. When this is the case, it not only keeps the foot oſ the raſter from ſlying out, but it hinds it down. In this case, the raſter acts as a powerſul lever, whose fulorum is the inner angle oſ the shoulder, and then the strap never ſails to cripple the raſter at the point. All this can be prevented only by making the strap very long and very oblique, and by making its outer end (the stirrup part) square with its length, and making a notch in the raſter ſoot to receive it. It cannot now cripple the raſter, for it will rise along with it, turning round the holt at its iuner end. We have been thus particular on this joint, because it is here that the ultimate strain of the whole rooſ is exerted, and its situation will not allow the excavation necessary ſor making it a good mortise and tenon, Similar attention must be paid to some other straps, such as those which embrace the middle of the raſter, and connect it with the post or truss below it. We must attend to the change oſ shape produced by the sagging of the roof, and nlace the strap in such a manner as to yield to it by turning round its holt, but so as not to become loose, and ſar less to make a ſulerum ſor any thing acting as a lever. The strains arising ſfrom such actions, in ſramings of carpentry which change their shape by sagging, are enormous, and nothing can resist them. 517. We shall close this part oſ the subject with » simple method, by which any carpenter, without mathematical science, may caleulate with suſficient precision the strains or thrusts which are produced on any point of his work, whatever he the obliquity of the pieces. Let it be roquired to find the horizontal thrust acting on the tie-beam AD of Fig. 18 This will be the same as if the weight oſ the whole rooſ were laid at G on the two rafters GA and GD. Drav the vertical line GH. Then, having calenlated the weight of the whole roof that is supported hy this single frame ABCD, including the weight oſ the pieces AB, BC, CD, BE, CF, themselves, take the number of pounds, tons, &e. which expresses it ſrom any scale of equal parts, and set it ſrom G to H. Draw HE, HL, parallel to GD, GA, and draw the line KL, which will be horizontal when the two sides of the rooſ have the same slope. Then ML measured on the same scalę will give the horizontal thrust, by which the strength oſ the tie- beam is to be regulated. GL will give the thrust which tends to crush the raſters, and LM vill also give the force which tends to crush the strutbeam BC, In like manner, to find the strain on the king-post BD oſ Fig. I7. consider that each brace is pressed by halſ the weight oſ the roofing laid on BA or BC, and this pręssure, or at least its hurtſul efſect, is diminished in the proportion of BA to DA, hecause the aetion oſ gravity is vertieal, and the efſeet whieh we want to counteract by the braces is in a direetion E e perpendiculur to BA or BC. But as this is to he resisted by the brace ſ E acting in the direetion ſ B, we must drav fe perpendicular to E e, and suppose the strain augmented in the proportion of E e to Ef. Having thus obtained in tons, pounds, or 6ther measures, the strains which must be balanced at  by the cohesion oſf the king-post, take this measure from the scãle 6f equal parts, and set ĩt off in the, direetions oſ the braces to G and H, and complete the parallelogram G f HK; and ſK measured on the same scale will be the strain on the king-post. 578. The artist may then examine the strength oſ his truss upon this principle, that every square ineh oſ oak will bear at an average T7000 pounds eompressing or stretehing it, and may be saſely loaded with 3500 ſor any length of time; and that a square inch oſ fir will in like manner securely bear 2500. And, because straps sre used to resist some oſ these struins, a square inch of well wrought tough iron may be saſely strained hy 50,000 pounds. But the artist will always recollect, that we cannot have the same confidence in iron as in timber. The ſaults of this last are much more easily perceived; and when timber is too weak, it gives us warning oſ its failure, by yielding sensibly before it breakss This is not the case with iron; and much oſ its service depends on the honesty oſ the blacksmith. 579. In this way may any design oſ a rooſ be examined. We shall here give the reader a sketeh oſ two or three trussed rooſs, which have been executed in the chieſ varieties of circumstances which occur in common practice. Fig. 2. oſ Plate VIII. is the rooſ of St Paul's Chureh, Covent Garden, London, the work of Inigo Jones. Its con- struction is singular. The rooſ extends to a considerable distance heyond the building, and the ends oſ the tie- heams; support the Tuscan corniche, appearing like the mutules oſ the Doric order. Such a rooſ could not rest on the tie: beam. Inigo dones has thereſore supported it by a trum below it; and the height has allowed him to make this extremely strong with, very little timber. It is acoountęd the highest rooſ oſ its width in London. But this was aot diſicult, by reason oſ the great height whioh its extreme width alloed him to employ without hurting the beauty of it by too high a pitoh. The supports; honæver, are disposed with judgment,*  au o Fig. 22. is a kirb or mansarde rooſ by Price, and supposed to he oſ large dimensions, having brares n casry the middle of the raſters It will serve exceedingly wull for a chureh- juog pillars. The middle part oſ the tie:heam being taken away, the strains are very well balanced, so that there is no risk oſ its pushing aside the pillars on which it rests. æ m Fig. 23. is the celebrated rooſ oſ the theatr oſ ihe university of Oxford, by Sir Christopher Wren. The span between the walls is 7õ feet,. This is accounted a very ingenious, and is a singular perſormance: The middle part oſ it is almost unchangeahie in its form; but ſrom this circumstance it does not distribute the horizontal thrust with the same regularity as the usual construeLion. The horizontal thrust on the tie-bæam is about twice the weight of the rooſ, and is withstood by an iron strap below the beam, which stretches the whole width oſ the huilding in the form oſ a rope, making part of the ornament oſ the ceiling. 580. In all ithe rooſs which we have considered hitherto, the thrust is discharged entirely ſfrom the walls by ? See Carpentry in this Vol. p 5406. the tie-beam. But this cannot always be done. We ſrèquently want great elevation within, and arched ceilings In such eases, it is a much more difficult matter to keep the walls free oſ all pressure outwards, and there are few buildings where it is eompletely done. Yet this is the greatest ſault oſ a roo We shall just point out the methods whieli may be most successſully adopted: We have said that a tie-heam just perſorms the oſfieè oſ a string We have said the same of the king-post. Now suppose two raſters AB, BC (Fig. 24.) moveable about the joint B, and resting on the top of the alls. If the line BD be suspended ſfrom B, and the two lines DA, DC, be ſastened to the ſeet oſ the raſters, and iſ these lines be incapuble o extension, ĩt is plin that all thrust is removed from the walls as eſfectually as by à common tię-beam. And'by shortening BD to B d, we gain a greater inside height, and more room for an arehed ceiling Now iſ wè substitute a king-post BD Fig. 25. and two stretchers or hammer beams DA; DC, ſor the other strings, and connect them firmly by means oſ iron straps; we obtain our purpose. Let us compore this rooſ with a tie-beam rooſ in point of strain and strength: Reeur to Fig. 24. and complete the parallelogram ABCF, and draw the diagonals AC, BF, crosing in E Drawv BG perpendicular to CD. We have seen that the weight of the rooſ, which we may eallW) is to the horizontal thrust at C as BF to EC; and iſ we express this thrust by T; we have wx EC T ES EBF lever moveable round the joint B, and pulled at C in the direction EC by the horizontal thrust, and held back by the string pulling in the direction CD. Suppose that the forees in the directions EC and CD are in equilibrio, and let us find the foree S by which the string CD is strained. These ſorces must (by the property oſ the Iever) be We may at present consider BC as a inversely as the perpendiculars drawvn ſrom the centre oſ motion on the lines oſ their direction Therefore BE BE. EC. BG: BEæT: S, and S æ T Xx BG x BFBG Therefore the strain upon each oſ the ties DA and DC is always greater than the horizontal thrust or the strain on a simple tie-beam. This would he no great inconvenience, because the smallest dimensions that we could give to these ties, so as to procure sufſficient fixtures to the adjoining pieces, are always suſſicient to withstand this strain. But although the same may be naid of the iron straps which make the ultimate conneetions, there is always some hazard of imperſect work, cracks or ſlaws, which are not perceivedl We can judge with tolerable certainty oſ the soundness oſ a pieee oſ timber, but cannot say so much of a piece oſf irom Moreover, there is a prodigious strain exeited on the king-post, vhen BG is very short in comparison of BE, namely, the force compounded oſ the two strains S and S on the ties DA and DC. But there is another deſect ſfrom which the straight tie-beam is entirely ſfree:. All rooſs settle a littlee. When this rooſ settles, and the points B and D descend, the legs BA, BC, must spread further out, and thus a pressuræ outwards is excited on the walls. It is seldom, thereſore; that this kind of rooſ can be executed in this simple ſorm, and other contrivances are necessary for counteracting this supervening action on the wallss Fig. 26. is one oſ the best which we have seen, and is executed with great suecess in the eircus or equestrian theatre in Edinburgh, the width being 60 ſeet. The pieces EF and ED help to take off some oſ the weight, and by their greater uprightness they exert a smaller thrust on the wallss. The beam D d is also a sort of truss-beam, having something oſ the same efſfect. Mr Price has given another very judicious one of this kind, ritish Carpenter, Plate I, Fig. C,) ſrom which the lie-beam may be taken avay, and there will remain very little thrust on the wallss. Those which he has given in the following Plate K are, in our opinion, very ſaulty. The whole strain in these last rooſs tends to break the raſters and tięs transversely, and the ſixtures oſ the ties are àlso not well calulated to resist the strain to which the pieces are exposed We hardly think that these rooſs conld be executed. 6S8i. IL is scorcely necessary to remind the reader, that in all that we have delivered on this subject, we have attended ouly ſo the construction oſ the principal raſters or trusses. In small buildings all the raſters are oſ one kind; but in great buildings the whole weight of the covering is made to rest on a ſew principal raſters, whieh nre connected by heams placed horizontally, and either mortised into them or scarſed on them. These are called purlins. Small raſters are laid ſrom purlin to purlin; and on these the laths for tiles, or the skirting-hoards for ilates, are nailed Thus the covering does not immediately rest on the principal ſramess. This allows some more liberty in their eonstruction, because the garrets can he so divided that the principal raſters shall be in the partitions, and the rest leſt unincumbered This construetion is so ſar analogous to that oſ floors which are constructed with girders, binding, and bridging joists. It may appear presuming in us to question the propriety oſ this practicee There are situations in which it is unavoidable, as in the rooſs oſ churches, which can be nllowed to rest on some pillars. In other situations, phere partition walls intervene at a distance not too great ſor a stout purlin, no principal raſters are necessary, and the wvhole may be rooſed with short raſters of very slender scantlingg But in a great uniform rooſ, which has no intermediate supports, it requires at least some reasons ſor preferring this method of carcase roofing to the simpler method of making all the, raſters alike. The meſhod oſ carẽase-roofing requires the seſection oſ the greatest logs oſ timher, which are seldom oſ equal itrength and soundness with thinner raſters. In these the outside planks can be taken off, and the best part alone worked up. It also exposes to all the deſeets of workmanship in the mortising oſ purlins, and the weakening oſ the raſters by this very mortising: and it brings an additional load oſ purlins and short raſters. A rooſ thus constructed may surely be compared with a ſloor of similar eonstruetion. Here there is not a shadow of doubt, that if the girders were sawed into planks, and these planks laid as joists sufficiently near for carryim”; the ſlooring boards, they will have the same strength as beſore, except so much as is taken out oſ the timber by the sav. This will not amount to one-tenth part oſ the timber in the binding, bridging, and ceiling joists, which are an additional load; and all the mortises and other joinings are so many diminutions of the strength oſ the girders; and as no part of a carpenter's work requires more skill and aceuracy oſ execution, we are exposed to many ehances oſ imperſection. But, not to rest on these considerations, however reasonable they may appear, we shall relate an ex periment made hy one on whose Jndgment and exactness we ean depend. 582 Two models of floors were made 18 inehes square oſ the fimest uniform deal, whieh had been long seasoned. The one consisted of simple joists, and the other was framed with girders, binding, bridging, and cẽiling joists. The plain joists oſ the one contained the same quantity of timber with the girders alone of the other, and both were made by a most accurate, orkman. They were placed in wooden trunks I8 inches square within, and vested on a strong projection on the inside. Small shot was gradually poured in upon the ſloors, so as ſo spreal uniſormly over them. The plain joisted ſloor broke down with 487 pounds, and the carcase ſloor with 397 The voL. I. 29 first broke without giving any warning; the other gave a violent erack when 204 pounds had been poured in. A trial had been made beſore, and the loads were 341 and 482. But the models having been made by a less uccurate hand, it was not thought a ſair specimen of the strength which might be given to a carcase ſloor. The only argument of weight which we can recolleet in favour oſ the compound construction oſ rooſs is, that the plain method would prodigiously increase the quantity of work, would admit nothing but long timber, which would greatly add to the expence, and would make the gurrets a mere thicket oſ planks We admit this in its ſull force; but we eontinue to be oſ the opinion that plain rooſs are greatly superior in point of strength, and thereſore should be adopted in cases where the great diſficulty is to insure this necessary circumstance. 583. It would appear very neglectſul to omit an account oſ the roofs put on round buildings, such as domes, cupolas, and the likee They appear to be the most diſſicult tasks in the art of carpentry. But the difficulty lies entirely in the mode of ſraming, or what the French call the trait de charpenterie The viev which we are taking oſ the subject, as a part of mechanical science, has little connection with this. It is plain, that whatever form oſ a truss is excellent in a square building must be equally 80 as one oſ the frames oſ a round one; and the only difficulty is how to manage their mutual intersections at the top. Some oſ them must be discontinued beſore they reach that length, and common sense will teach us to cut them short alternately, and always leave as many, that they may stand equally thick as at their first springing ſrom the base oſ the dome. Thus the length oſ the purlins which reach ſrom truss to truss will never he too great. The truth is, that a round building which gathers in aut top, like a glasshouse, a potters kiln, or a spire steeple, instead oſ heing the most diſicult to erect with stability, is of all others the easiest. Nothing can show this more ſorcibly than daily practice, where they are run up without centres and without scaſſoldings: and it requires gross blunders indeed in the choice oſ their outline to put them in much danger oſ fſalling from a want oſ equilibrium. In like manner, a dome oſ carpentry can hardly ſall, give it what shape or what construction you will. It cannot fall unless some part oſ it ſlies out at the bottom: an iron hoop round it, or straps at the joinings oſ the trusses and purlins, which make an equivalent to a hoop, vill eſfectually secure it. And as beauty requires that a dome shall spring almost perpendicularly from the wall, it is evident that there is hardly any thrust to force out the walls The only part where this is to be guarded against is, where the tangent is inclined about 40 or 50 degrees to the horizonn. Here it will be proper to make a course oſ firm horizontal joinings. We doubt not but that domes of carpentry will now be raised of great extent. The old Halle au Bled at Paris, oſf 200 feet in liameter, was the invention oſ an intelligent carpenter, the Sieur Moulineauu He was not hy any means a man oſ seience, hut had much more mechanieal know ledge than artisans usually have, and was convinced that a very thin shell oſ timber might not only be so shaped as to be nearly in equilibrio, but that iſ hooped or firmly connected horizontally, it would have all the stifſness that was necessary; and he presented his project to the magistraey oſ Paris. The grandeur oſ it pleased them, but they doubted oſ its possibility. Being a great public work, they prevailed on the Academy oſ Sciences to consider it. The members, vho were competent judges, were instantly struck with the justness oſ Mr Moulineau's principles, and were astonished that a thing so plain had not been long familiar to every house- carpenter. It quickly became an universal topic oſ eonversation, dispute, and cabal, in the polite circles oſ Pariss But the Academy having given a very ſavourable report oſ their opinion, the projeet was immediately carried into execution, and soon completed, and now stands as one oſ the great exhibitions oſ Paris *. The construetion of this dome is the simplest thing that can be imagined. The circular ribs which compose it consist of planks nine ſeet long, 18 inches broad, and three inches thick; and each rib consists of three oſ these planks holted together n such a manner that two joints meet. A rib is begun, for instance, with a plank of three ſeet long standing between one oſ six ſeet and another oſ nine, and this is continued to the head oſ it. No machinery was necessary ſor carrying up such small pieces, and the whole went up like a piece oſ bricklayer's work. At various distances these ribs were connected horizontally by purlins and iron straps, which made so many hoops to the whole When the work had reached such a height, that the distance oſ the rihs was two- thirds oſ the original distance, every third rib was discontinued, and the space was leſt open and glazel. When carried so mueh higher that the distance oſ the ribs is one- third oſ the original distance, every second rib (now consisting of two ribs very near ench other) is in like manner discontinued, and the void is glazed. A little above this the heads oſ the ribs are ſramed into a circular ring of timber, which forms a wide opening in the middle; over which is a glazed cunopy or umbrella, with an opening between it and the dome for allowing the heated air to get out. All who have seen this dome say, that it is the most beautiſul and magniſicent object they have ever beheld. This rooſ has been long since destroyed, and another oſ smaller dimensions has been erected with ribs oſ ron, covered with sheet copper Eo. i The only diſieulty which occurs in the construetion of wooden domes is, when they are unequally loaded, by carrying a heavy lanthern or cupola in the middle In such a case, iſ the dome were a mere shell, it would be crushed in at the top, or the action oſ the wind on the lanthern might tear it out of its place. Such a dome must thereſore consist oſ trussed ſfrumes. Mr Price has given a very good one in his plate OP, though much stronger in the trusses than there was any occasion ſor. This causes a great loss of room, and throws the lights oſ the lanthern too ſar up. It is evidently copied ſrom Sir Christopher Wrens dome of St Paul's church in London; a model oſ propriety in its purticular situation, but by no means a general model oſ a wooden dome. It rests on the brick cone within it; and Sir Christopher has very ingeniously made use oſ it ſor stiſſening this cone, as any intelligent person will perceive by attending to its construction. (S8ee Price, Plate OP). Fig. 27. represents a dome executed in the Register Office of Edinhurgh, by James and Robert Adams, and is very agreeahle to mechanical principles. The span ĩs 50 ſeet elear, and the thickness is only 44. 584. We cannot quit this subject without taking some notice oſ what we have already spoken oſ with commendation by the name oſ Norman rooſs. We ealled them Norman, because they were frequently executed by that people soon aſter their establishment in Italy and other parts oſ the south oſ Europe, and became the prevailing taste in all the great haronial castles. Their architects were rivals to the Saracens and Moors, who about that time built many Christian churches; and the architecture which we now eall Gothic seems to have arisen ſrom their joint labours. j The principle of a Norman rooſ is extremely simple. The raſters all butted on joggled king-posts AF, BG, CH, &e. (Fig. 2.), and braces or ties were then dispos- ed in the intervals. In the middle oſ the roo HB and HID are evidently ties in a state of extension, while the post CH is compressed by them. Towards the walls on each side, as between B and F, and between F and L, they are braces, and are compressedl. The ends of the posts were generally ornamented with knots oſ flowers, embossed globes, and the like, and the whole texture of the truss was exhibited and dressed out. This construction admits of employing very short timbers; and this very circumstance gives greater strength to the truss, because the angle which the brace or tie makes with the raſter is more openn. We may also perceive that all thrust may be taken off the walls. Iſ the pieces AF, BF, LF, he removed, all the remaining diagonal pieces act as ties, and the pieces directed to the centre act as struts; and it may also be ohserved, that the principle will apply equally to a straight or flat rooſ, or to a floor. A ſloor such as a b e, having the joint in two pieces a b, b e, with a strut b d, and two ties, will require a much greater weight to break it than if it had a continued joist a c oſf the same scantling. And, lastly, a piece oſ timber acting as a tie is much stronger than the same piece acting as a strut: for in the latter situotion it is exposed to bending, and when bhent it is much less able to withstand a very great strain. It must be ncknowledged, however, that this advantage is balanced by the great inſeriority oſ the joints in point of strength. The joint oſf a tie depends wholly on the pins; ſor this reason ties are never used in heavy works without strapping the joints with iron. In the rooſs we are now describing, the diagonal pieces of the middle part only act purely as ties, while those towards the sides act as struts or braces. Indeed they are seldom of s0 very simple construction as ve have described, and are more generally constructed like the sketch in Fig. 29. having two sets oſ rafters AB, o b, and the angles are filled up with thin planks, which give great stifſness and strength. They have also a double set oſ purlins, which conneet the different trusses. The rooſ being thus divided into squares, other purlins run between the middle points E oſ the raſterss The raſter is supported at E by a check put between it and the under raſter. The middle point oſ each square of the rooſ is supported and stifſened by ſour braces, one oſ which springs from e, and its opposite ſrom the similar part of the adjoining truss The other two braces spring from the middle points of the lower purlins, which go horizontally from a and b to the next truss, which are supported by planks in the same manner as the raſters. By this eontrivance the whole becomes very stiſſ and strong. 585. We hope that the reader will not he displeased with our having taken some notice of what was the pride oſ our ancestors, and constituted a great part oſ the finery oſ the grand hall, where the ſeudal lord assembled his vassals, and displayed his magnificencee The intelligent mechanic will see much to commend; and all who look at these rooſs admire their appurent ſlimsy lightness, and wonder at their duration. We have seen a hall of 57 ſeet wide, the rooſ oſ which was in ſour divisions, like a kirb roof, and the trusses were ahout 16 ſeet asunder. They were single raſters, as in Fig. 2. and their dimensions were only eight inches by six. The rooſ appeared perſectly sound, and had been standing ever since the year 1425. Much of what has been said on this subject may be applied to the construction of wooden bridges, and the centres ſor turning the arches oſ stone bridges.  B8l6 ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF ARCHES. 586. Ax areh is an artſul disposition and adjustment of several stones or bricks, generally in a bow- like form, by which their weight produces a mutual pressure and abutment; so0 that they not only support enchoſher, and perſorm the office of an entire lintel, but may be extended to any width, and made to earry the most enormous weights. i 567. The pediment oſ the Greeks seems to have suggested the construction oſ the arcch. In erecting their amall houses, they could hardly ſail to observe oceasionally, that when two raſters were laid together ſfrom the opposite walls, they would, by leaning on each other, give mutual support, as in Fig. l. Plate X. Nor is it unlikely that such a situation oſ stones as is represented in Fig. 2. would not unſrequently occur by accident to masons. This could hardly ſail oſ exciting a little attention and reſlectionn. It was a pretty obvious reſlection, that the stones A and C, by overhunging, leaned against the intermediate stone B, and gave it some support, and that B cannot get down without thrusting aside A and C, or the piers which support them. This was an approach to the theory oſ an arch; and if this be combined with the observation oſ Fig. I. we get the disposition represented in Fig. S. having a perpendicular joint in the middle, and thè principſe of tht ureh is completedl. Ohserve that this is quite difſerent ſrom the prineiple of the arrangement in Fig. 2. In that figure the stones act as vedges, and one ramot get down without thrusting the rest aside; the same principle obtains in Fig. 4. conĩsting oſ five arch stones; but in Fig. 8. the stones Ii and C support each other hy their mutual pressure (independent of their own meight), arising ſrom the tendency oſ each lateral pair to ſall outwards ſfrom the pier. This is the principle of the areh, and would support the keystone oſ Fig. 4. al, though each oſ its joints were perpendicular, by reason of the great ſriction arising ſrom the horiZzontal thrust exetited by the adjoining stones. 2.his was a most important discovery in the art of building; for now a building oſ any width may he rooſed with stone 588. We are disposed to give the Greeks the merit of this diseovery; ſor we ohserve arches in the most ancient huildings: of Greece, such as the Temple oſ the Sun at Athens, and oſf Apollo at Didymos; not indeed as rooſi 10 any apartment, nor as paris oſ the ornamental design, but concealed in the walls, covering drains, or other necessary openings; and we have not ſound any real arches in any monuments oſ ancient Persia or Egypt. Sir John Chardin speaks of numerous and extensive subterranean passages at Tchelminar, built oſ the most exquisite masonry, the joiuts so exact, anid the stones so heautiſully dressed, that they look like one continued piece oſ polished marble: but he nowhere says that they are arehed; a circumstance which we think he would not hęve omit4ed—no orched door or vindow is to be seen. Indeed nne of the tomhs is said to be arch rooſed, but it is all of one solid rock. No trace of an areh is to he seen in the ruins oſ ancient Egypt; even a wide room is covered with a single block of stone. In the pyramids, indeed, there are two galleries, whose rooſs consist of many pieces; but their construction puts it beyond doubt that the builder did not know what an arch was: ſor it is covered in the manner represented in Fig. 5. where every projecting piece is more than balãnced behind, so that the whole aukward mass could have stood on two pillars. The Greeks therefore seem entitled to the honour oſ the invention. The arched dome, however, seems to have arisen in Etruria, and originated in all probability ſrom the employment oſf the augurs, vhose business it was to observe the ſlight of birdss Their stations for this purpose were templa, s0 called a templando,  on the summits of hills To shelter such a person from the weather, and at the same time allow him a full prospect oſ the country around him, no building was so proper as a dome set on columns; which accordingly is the figure of a temple in the most ancient monuments oſ that eountry. We do not recollect a building oſ this kind in Greece except that called the Lanthern of Demosthenes, which is oſ very late date, whereas they abounded in Italy. In the later monuments and coins oſ Italy or of Rome, we commonly find the Etrusean dome and the Grecian temple combined; and the famous Pantheon was of this form, even in its most ancient state. 589. About the middle, or rather towards the end of last century, when the Newtonian mathematios opened the road to true mechanical science, the construetion of arches engrossed the attention of the first mathematicians. The first hint oſ a principle that we have met with is Dr Hooke's assertion, that the figure into which a chain or rope, perſectly flexible, will arrange itselr when suspended from two hooks, is, when inverted, the proper form for an arch composed of stones oſ uniſorm weight. This he aſſirmed on the principle that the figure which a ſlexible ſestoon of heavy bodies assumes, when suspended ſrom two points, is, vhen inverted, the proper ſorm ſor an arch oſ the same bodies, touching each other in the same points; beeause the forces with which they mutually press on each other in this last case, are equal and opposite to the forces with which they pull at each other in the case oſ suspension. This principle is strictly just, and may be extended to every ease which can be proposed. We recolleet seeing it proposed, in very general terms, in the St Jamess Chroniele in 1759, when plans were ſorming ſor Blackſriars Bridge in London; and since it is perhaps equal in practical utility, to the most elaborate investigations of the mathematicians, our readers will not be displeased with a more particular account oſ it in this place. 590. Let ABC (Fig. 6.) be a parcel of magnets oſ any size and shape, and let us suppose that they adhere with great ſorce by any points of contact. They will compose such a ſlexible festoon as we have heen speaking of, iſ suspended from the points A and C. If this figure be inverted, preserving the same points of contact, they will remain in equilibrio. It will indeed be that kind oſ equilibrium which will admit oſf no disturbance, and which may be culled a tottering equilibrium. Iſ the form be altered in the smallest degree, by varying the points oſ contact (which indeed are points in the ſigure of equilibrium), the magnets will no more recover their former position than a needlę, which we had made to stand on its point, will regain iĩts perpendicular position aſter it has been disturbed. But if we suppose planes d e, ſg, hi, &e. drawn, that the points of mutual contact , b, c, each bisecting the angle formed by the lines that unite the adjoining eontacts (ſg, for example, bisecting the angle formed hy a b, b e), and if we suppose that the pieces are changed for others of the same weights, but having ſlat sides, which meet in the planes d e, ſg, hi, &e. it is evident that we shall have an arch of equilibration, and that the arch will have some stability, or will bear a little change of form vithout tumbling down: ſor it is plain that the equilibrium oſ the original ſestoon obtained only in the points o, b, æ, of contaet, where the pressures were perpendicular to the touching surſaces; thereſore iſ the curve o, b, ę, still passes throngh the touching surſaces perpendicularly, the conditions that are required fſor equilibrium still obtainn. The case is quite similar to that of the stability oſ a hody re-ting on a horizontal plane. Iſ the perpendicular through the centre oſ gravity ſalls within the base of the body, it will not only stand, but will require some force to push it over. In the original ſestoon, if a small weight be added in any part, it will change the form oſ the curve oſ equilibration a little, by changing the points oſf mutual contact. This new curve will gradually separate from the ſormer curve as it recedes ſfrom A or C. In like manner, when the festoon is set up as an areh, iſ a small weight bo laid on any part oſ it, it will bring the whole to the ground, beeause the shiſting oſ the points of contact will be just the contrary to what it should be to suit the new curve oſ equilibration. But iſ the same weight be laid on the same part of the arch now constructed with ſlat joints, it will be sustained, iſ the new curve of equilibration still passes through the touching surſaces. These conclusions, which are very obviously deducible ſrom the principle of the ſestoon, shew us, without any further discussion, that the longer the joints are, the greater will be the stability of the arch, or that it will require a greater force to break it down. Thereſore it is of the greatest importance to have the arch stones as long as economy will permit; and this was the great use oſ the ribs and other apparent ornaments in the Gothic architeeture The great projections oſ those ribs augmented their stifſuess, and enabled them to support the unadorned copurtments of the rooſ, composed of very small stones, seldom above six inches thick Many old bridges are still remaining, which are strengthened in the same way by ribs. Having thus explained, in a very ſamiliar manner, the stahility oſ an arch, we proceed to give the same popular account oſ the general application oſ the principle. 591. Suppose it to be required to ascertain the ſorm of an arch which shãll have the spun AB (Fig. 7.), and the height F 8, and which shall have a road way oſ the dimensions CDE above it. Let the figure ACDEB be inverted, so as to ſorm a figure Ac de B. Let a chain of uniſorm thickness be suspended from the points A and B, and let it be oſ such a length that its lower point will hang at, or rather a little below ſ, corresponding to F. Divide AB into a number oſ equal parts, in the points I, 2, 3, &e. and draw vertical lines, cutting the chain in the corresponding points 1, 2, 3, &e. Now take pieces oſ another chain, and hang them on at the points I, è, 3, &e. of the chain A ſB. This will alter the form oſ the curve. Cut or trim these pieces oſ chain, lill their lower ends all coincide with the inverted road-way c dee. The greater lengths that are hung on in the vicinity oſ A and B will pull down these points of the chain, and cause the middle point f (which is less loaded) to rise a little, and will bring it near to its proper height. It is plain that this process will produce an arch of perfect equilibration; but some ſarther considerations are necessary ſor making it exactly suit our purpose. It ĩs an arch oſ equilibration ſor a bridge, that is so loaded that the weight oſ the arch stones is to the weight of the matter with which the haunches and crown are loaded, as the weight oſ the chain AſB is to the sum of the weights oſ all the little bits oſ chain very nearly. But this proportion is not known beforehand; we must thereſore proceed in the ſollowing manner: Adapt to the curve produced in this way a thickness oſ the arch stones as great as are thought suſſicient to insure stability; then compute the weight oſ the arch stones, and the weight oſ the gravel or rubbish with which the haunches are to be ſilled up to the road-way. If the proportion oſ these two weights be the same with the proportion oſ the weights oſ chain, we may rest satisfied with the curve now ſound; but if difſferent, we ean easily calculate how much must be added equally to, or taken from, each appended bit oſ chain, in order to make the two proportions equal. Having altered the appended pieces accordingly, we shall get a new curve, which may perhaps require a very small trimming oſ the bits oſ chain to make them fit the road-way. This curve will be infinitely near to the curve wanted. We have practised this method for an arch oſ 60 ſeet span and 2I ſeet height, the arch stones oſf which were only two ſeet nine inches long. It was to be loaded with gravel and shivers. We made a previous computation, on the supposition that the arch was to be nearly elliptical. The distance between the poinis I, 2, 3, &e. were adjusted, so as to determine the proportion oſ the weights oſ chain agreeable to the supposition. The curve difſered considerably from an ellipse, making a considerable angle with the verticals at the spring oſ the arch. The real proportion of the weights oſ chain, when all was trimmed s0 as to suit the road-way, was considerably difſerent ſfrom what was expected. Itwas adjusted. The adjustment made very little change in the curve. It would not have ehanged it two inches in any part oſ the real archh. When the process was completed, we construoted the curve mathematically. It did not difſer sensibly ſrom this mechanieal construction. This was very agreeable information; ſor it showed us that the first curve, formed by ahout two hours labour, on a supposition considerubly different from the truth, would have been sufficiently exact ſor the purpose, being in no place three inches ſrom the accurate curve, and thereſore ſar within the joints of the intended arch stones. Therefore this process, which any intelligent mason, though ignorant oſf mathematical science, may go through with little trouble, will give a very proper ſorm ſor an arch subject to any conditions. 592. The chieſ deſect oſ the eurve ſound in this way is a vant oſ elegance, because it does not spring at right angles to the horizontal line; but this is the case with all curves oſ equilibration, as we shall see by and hy. It is not material: ſor, in the very neighbourhood of the piers, we may give it any form we please, because the masonry is solid in that place; nay, we apprehend that a deviation from the curve oſ equilibration is proper. The eonstruetion of that curve supposes that the pressure on every pat of the arch is vertical; but gravel, earth, and rubbish, exert somewhat oſ a hydrostatical pressure laterally in the act oſ settling, and retain it aſterwards. This will require some more curvature at the haunches of an areh to halance it; but what this lateral pressure may be, cannot be deduced with confidence ſrom any experiments that we have seen. We are inclined to think that if, instead of dividing the horizontal line AB in the points 1, 2, 3, &e. we divide the chain itselſ into equal parts, the curve will approach nearer to the proper form. 599. Aſter this ſamiliar statement of the general principle, it is now time to consider the theory founded on it more in detail. This theory aims at such an adjustment oſ the position oſ the arch stones to the load on every part oſ the arch, that all shall remain in equilibrio, although the joints be peiſectly polished, anud without any cement. The whole may be reduced to two problems. The ſirst is to determine the vertical pressure or load on every point oſ a line oſ a given ſorm, which will put that line in equilibrio. The second is to determine the ſorm of a curve which shall be in equilibrio when loaded in its diſferent points, according to any given law. The whole theory is deducible ſrom ꝑ. 562 oſ the article Roor. The fundamental proposition in that page states the proportions hetween the various pressures or thrusts which aræ exerted at the angles of an assemblage oſ beams or other pieces of solid heavy matter, ſreely moveable about those angles, as so many joints, but retaining their position hy the equilibrium of those pressures. It is there demonstrated,  that the thrust at any angle, iſ estimated in a horizontal direction, is ſthe same throughout, and may he represented by any horizontal line BT, Fig. 8. (toors, Fig. I0. Plate IX.); and that iſ a vertieal line QTS be drawn through T, the thrust exerted at any angle D by the piece CD, in its own direetion, will then be represented by BR, drawvn purallel to CD; and in like manner, that the thrust in the direction ED is represented by BS, &e.; and, lastly, that the vertical thrusts or loads, at each angle B, C, D, by which all these other pressures are excited, are represented by the portions QC, CR, RS, oſ the vertieal intercepted by those lines; that is, all these pressures are to the uniſorm horiZzontal thrust as the lines whieh represent them are to BT. The horiontal thrust, therefore, is a very proper unit, with which we may compare all the others. Its magnitude is easily deduced ſrom the same proposition; for QS is the sum of all the vertical pressures of the angles, and thereſore represents the weight of the whole assemhlagee Thereſore as QS is to BT, s0 is the weight oſ the whole to the horizontal thrust. 594. To aceommodate this theory to thæ construetion of a curvilineal arch vault, let us first suppose the vault to be polygonal, composed of the cords oſ the elementary archess. Let AVE (Fig. 9.) be a curvilineal arch, oſ which V is the vertex, and VX the vertical axis, whieh ve shall eonsider as the axis or abscissa oſ the eurve, while any horiontal line, such as HE, is an ordinate to the eurve. About any point C oſ the curve as a eentre describe a circle BLD, cutting the curve in B and D. Drav the equal cords CB, CD. Draw al3o the horizon- tal Iime CF, cutting the cirele in P. Deseribe a cirele BCDQ passing through B, C, D. Iis centre O will lie in u line COQ, which hisects the angle BCD, and Ce, which touches this cirele in C, will bisect the angle b C d, formed by the equal chords BC, CD. Draw CLP perpendiculur to c b and DP perpendicular to CD meeting CL in P. Through L draw the tangent GLM, meeting ( D in G, and the vertical line CM in M Draw thè tangent F a, cutting the chords BC, CD, in b and d, and the tangent to the circle BUDQ in e. Lastly, draw d N parallel to BC. From what is demonstrated in the article Roor, it appears, that if BC, CD, he two pieces oſ an equilibrated heavy polygon, and if CF represent the horizontal thrust in every angle oſ the polygon, Cd and C b will severally represent the thrusts exerted by the pieces DC, BC, and that b d, or CN, Will represent the weight lying on the angle BCD, by which those thrusts' are halanced. Produce d C to o, so that C o mãy he equal to C d. Draw b n to the vertical parallel to d B, and join n o. It is evident that b n o C is a parallelogram, and that nC (=bd) = CN. Now the thrust or support oſ the piece BC is exerted in the direction Cb, while that oſ DC is exerted in the direetion Co. These two thrusts are equivalent to the thrust in the diagonal Cn; and it is with this compound thrust that the load or vertical pressure CN is in immediate equilibrium. 595. Because b CL, NCF, are right angles, and FCL is common to both, the angles b CF and MCL are equal. Thereſore the right angled triangles L CF and MCL are similar. And since CF is equal to CL, Cb is equal to CM. It is evident that the triangles GCM and d ON are similan. Thereſore CG: Cd æ CM: CN, æ Cb: CN. ChxCd Thereſore we have CN ru But because CDP VOL. I. E and CLG are right angles, and thereſore equal, and the angle GCP is common to the two triangles GCL, PCD, and CD is equal to. CL, we have CG equal to CP. Thereſore CN = . Also, since CDP is a right angle, DP meets the diameter in Q, the opposite point oſ the circumſerence, and the angle DQUC is equal to DC f, or c C h (because b C d is bisected by the tangent), that is, to PCQ (because the right angles b CP, c CO are equal, and c DP is common). Thereſore PQ is equal to PC; and if PO be drawn perpendicular to CQ, it will bisect it, and O is the centre oſ the cirele BCDOB. Now let the points B and D continually approach to C (by diminishing the radius oſ the small cirele) and ultimately coincide with it. It is evident that the circle BCDQ is ultimately the equicurve cirele, and that PC ultimately coincides with OC, the radius oſ eurvature. Also Cb x C d becomes immediately equal to C c?. Therefore ON, the vertical load on any point oſ a curve oſ equiCæ Rad. Curv. It is farther evident, that CF is to Cc as radius to the secant oſ the elevation oſ the tangent above the horizon. Thereſore we have the load on any point oſ the curve alSec. Elev. Rad. Curv. This load on every elementary arch oſ the wall is commonly a quantity of solid matter incumbent on that element of the curve, and pressing it vertically; and it may be conceived as made up oſ a number oſ heavy lines standing verticully on it. Thus, iſ the element E e oſ the curve were lying horiontally, a little parallelogram RE e r, standing perpendicularly on it, would represent its loadl. But as this element E e has a sloping position, libration is ways proportional to it is plain that, in order to have the same quantity oſf heavy matter pressing it vertically, the height oſ the parallelogram must be increased till it meets in : the line R. drawn parallel to the tangent EG. It is evident that the angle RE/ is equal to the angle AEG. Phorelure we have ER: E-  Rad.: Sec. Elev*. If thereſore the arch is kept in equilibrio by the vertical pressure oſ a wall, ve must have the height oſ the wall ab t tional to œæ all above any point proportional to Rad. oſ Curv. 596. Cor. I. If OS be drawn perpendicular to the vertical CS, CS will be half the vertical chord oſ the equicurve circle The angle OCS is equal to c CF, that is, to the angle oſ elevationn Thereſore I: Sec. Elev. = CS: CO, and the secant oſ elevation may be expressed 5 by and its cube by Therefore the height or CO , or to Ts oſ wall is proportional to S xCO CO Sec.? of Elev. TS x Cs' t Vert Chord of Cur. Cor. II. If we make the arch VC æ2, the abscissa VH æ xæ, the ordinate HC 4y, the radius osculi CO ær, and the à vertical chord CS =5, the height oſ wall pressing on any point is proportional to, or to . or 5 v r vę +y5 Thereſore, when the equation of the curve v5 is given, and the height oſ wall on any one point oſ it is also given, we can determine it ſor any other point: for the equation oſ the curve will always give us the relation oſ ⸗ x and and the value of r or s. This may be illustrated by an example or two. For this purpose it will generally be most convenient to assume the height above the vertex V ſor the unit of computationn. The thickness of the arch at the crown is commonly determined by other circumstancess. At the vertex the tangent to the arch is horizontal, and therefore the cube oſ the secant is unity or I. Call the height oſ wall, at the crown, H, and let the radius oſ curvature in that point be R, and its halſ chord R (it being then coincident with the radius), and the height on any other point :. We have z =H: I, TE. PESLS The other ſor5 r y r mula gives h = H x z x r a E 597. Examp. . Suppose the arch to be a segment oſæ cirele, as in Fig. 10. where AE is the diameter, and O the centre In this arch the eurvature is the same 5 throughout, or i 1. Therefore  / H x, or æ u. =H x Cube Sec. Elev. This gives a very simple calculuss. To the logarithm oſ H add thrice the logarithm of the secant of elevation. The sum is the logarithm of h. It gives also a very simple construetionn. Draw the vertical CS, cutting the horizontal diameter in S. Draw ST, cutting the radius OC perpendicularly in T. Drav the horizontal line⸗, cutting the vertical in 2. doin 7 O. Make C u V», and draw u æ parallel to æ O. Cc must be made  C x. The demonstration is evident. It is very easy to see that if CV is an arch of 60°, and Vo is ;th ol VC, the points v and c will be on a level; ſor the secant of CV is twice CO, and thereſore C c is 8 times V, whien is bth of VH. Tne line v gef is drawn according to this ealevIus or constructionn. It ſalls considerably below the horizontal line in the neighbourhood of ; and then, OF ARCHES. 620 passing very obliquely through c, ĩt rises rapidly to an unmeasurable height, because the vertical line through A is its assymptote. This must evidently be the case with every curve which springs at right angles with a horiontal line. It is plain that iſ v V be greater, all the other ordinates oſ the curve » gef, resting on the circumference AVE, will be greater in the same proportion, and the curve will cut the horizontal line drawn through v in some point nearer to o than e is Hence it appears that a circular arch cannot be put in equilibrio by building on it up to a horizontal line, whatever be its span, or whatever he the thickness at the crown. We have seen that when this thickness is only,l; oſ the radius, an arch of 120 degrees will be too much loaded at the flanks. This thickness ĩs much too small for a bridge, being only ,; of the span CM, whereas it should have been almost double oſ this, to bear the inequalities oſ weight that may occasionally be on itt. When the crown is made still thinner, the outline is still more depressed hefore it rises againn. There is thereſore a certain span, with a corresponding thickness at the crown,, which will deviate least of all from a horizontal line. This is an arch of about 54 degrees, the thickness at the crown being about one-ſourth of the span, which is extravagantly great. It appears in general, thereſore, that the circle is not a curve suited to the purposes oſ a bridge or an arcade, which requires an outline nearly horizontal. Examp. 2. Let the curve be a parabola AVE (Fig I1.), of which V is the vertex, and DG the direetrix. Draw the diameters DCF, GVN, the tangents CK, VP, and the ordinates VF and ON. It is well known that GV is to DC as VP? to CK?, or as ON? to CK2. Also 2 GV is the radius of the osculating cirele at V, and 2 DC is one-half oſ the verticeal chord oſ the osculating cirele at C. Therefore CN?: CK? (or i : 7) R:, and s 2/ R. But C, or h =H x Thereſore n=H xR uX pr- = H. Thereſore Ce æVo. It follows from this inve;tigation, that the back or extrados oſ a parabolic arch oſ equilibration must be parallel to the arch or soſit itself; or that the thickness of the arch, estimated in a vertical direction, must be equal throughout; or that the extrados is the same parabola with the soſfit or intrados. We have selected these two examples merely for the simplicity and perspicuity of the solutions, which have been efſected by means oſ elementary geometry only, instead of employing the analytical value of the radius . Y &5 . of the osculatory cirele vi?. — -, whichwould vx2xy have involved us at least in the elements of second ſluxions We have also preſerred simplicity to elegance in the investigation, because we wish to instruet the practical engineer, vho may not be a proficient in the higher mathematics. B9T. The converse oſ the problem, namely, to find the ſorm oſ the arch when the figure oſ the hack of it is given, is the most useſul question oſ the two, at least in cases which are most important and most difficult. Oſ these perhaps bridges are the chief. Iere the necessity oſ a road-way, of easy and regular- ascent, conſines us to an outline nearly horizontal, to which the curve of the arch must be adapted. This is the most diſficult i problem oſ the two; and we doubt whether it can be solved without employing infinite approximating serieses instead of accurate values. Let a v e (Fig. 12.) be the intended outline or extrados oſ the arch AVE, and let  Qbe the common axis oſ both curves. From e and C, the corresponding points, draw the ordinates c hi, CH. Let the thickness v V at the top be a, the abscissa v h be = u, and VH =æ, and let the equal ordinates c h, CH be 5, and the arch VC be æ. Then, by the general theorem, c C = æ 7, ſ being the radius oſ curvature This, by the common rules, is is 2 —Dhis gives us c C L353, or y2y y Y 2V x C; where C is a constant quantity, 5 . ſound by taking the real value oſ e C in V, the vertex oſf the curve. But it is evident that ĩit is also = a x u. § 2dV c =F Therefore a +H xu ;  Xx fſluxion - v . i x of y I we now substitute the true value oſf u (which iĩs given, because the extrados is supposed to be oſ a known form), expressed in terms of y, the resulting equation will contain nothing but æ and y, with their first and second ſluxions, and known quantities. From this equation the relation oſ æ and 5 must be ſound by such methods as seem best adapted to the equation of the extrados. Fortunately the process is more simple and easy in the most common and useſul case than we should expecet from this general rule We mean the case where the As an example of the use oſ this ſormula, we subjoin a table ealculated by Dr Hutton oſ Woolwiceh ſor an arch, the span of which is 100 ſeet and the height 40, which are nearly the dimensions oſ the middle arch of Blackſriars Bridge in London. 596. The ſigure for this proposition is exactly drawn according to these dimensions, that the reader may judge oſ it as an ohject of sight. It is by no means deficient in graceſulness, and is abundantly roomy for the passage of craſt; so that no objection can be oſſered aguinst its being adapted on account of its mechanical excellency. The reader will perhaps be surprised that we have made no mention oſ the celebrated Catenarean curve, which is commonly said to he the best form for an arch:; but a little reſlection will convince him, that although it is the only ſorm for an arch consisting of stones oſ equal weight, and touching each other only in single points, it cannot suit an arch which must be filled up in the haunches, in order to form a road-way. He will be more surprised to hear, aſter this, that there is a certain thickness at the crown, which will put the Catenarea in equilibrio, even with a horizontal road-way;: but this thickness is so great as to make it unſit for a bridge, being such that the pressure at the vertex is equal to the horizontal thrust. This would have heen about 37 ſeet in the middle arch oſ Blackſriars Bridge. The only situation thereſore in which the Catenarean form would be proper, is an arcade carry ing a height of dead wall; but in this situation it would be very ungraceſu. Without troubling the reader with the investigation, it is suſſicient to inſorm him that in a Catenarean arch oſ equilibration the abscissa VH is to the abscissa v h in the constant ratio of the horizontal thrust to its excess above the pressure on the vertex. 599. This much will serve, we hope, give the reader a clear notion of this celebrated theory of the equilibrium oſ arches, one oſ the most delicate and important applications oſ mathematical science Volumes have been written on the subject, and it still occupies the attention of mechanicianss But we beg leave to say, with great deference to the eminent persons who have prosecuted this theory, that their speculations have been oſ little service, and are little attended to by the practitioner. Nay, we may add, that Sir Christopher Wren, perhaps the most accomplished architect that Europe has seen, seems to have thought it oſ little value: for, among the fragments which have been preserved oſ his studies, there are to be seen some imperfect dissertations on this very subject, in which he takes no notice oſ this theory, and - eonsiders the balance oſ arches in quite another way. These are collected by the author of the account oſ Sir Christopher Wren's ſamily. This man's great sagacity, and his great experience in building, and still more his experience in the repairs oſ old and crazy fabrics, had shown him many things very inconsistent with this theory, which appears so specious and saſe. The general facts which occur in the failure of old arches are highly instructive, and deserve the most careſul attention of thę engineer; for it is in this state that their defects, and the process oſ nature in their destruetion, are most distinctly seen. We venture to aſfirm, that a very great majority of these ſacts. are irreconcileable to the theory. The way in which circular arches commonly ſail, is by the sinking oſ the crown anũ the rising oſ the ſlanks. It will be ſound by calculation, that in most of the cases it ought to have heen just the contrary. But the clearest prooſ is, that arches very rarely ſail where their load differs most remarkably ſrom that which this theory allows. Semicireular arches have stood the power of ages, as may he seen in the bridges oſ ancient Rome, and in the numerous areades which the ancient inhahitants have erectedc. Now all arches which spring perpendicularly from the horizontal line, require, by this theory, a load of infinite height; and, even to a considerable distance ſrom the springing oſ the areh, the load necessary for the theoretical equilibrium is many times greater than what is ever laid on those parts; yet a failure in the immediate neighbourhood of the spring oſ an arch is a most rare phenomenon, iſ it ever was observed. Here is a most remarkable deviation from the theory; for, as is already observed, the load is frequently not the fourth part oſ what the theory requires. Many other facts might be adduced which shew great deviations ſfrom the legitimate results of the theory. We hope to be excused, thereſore, by the mathematicians for doubting oſ the justness of this theory. We do not think it erroneous, but defective, leaving out circumstances which we apprehend to he of great importance; and we imagine that the defects have arisen ſrom the very mnxiety of the mechanicians to make it perfect. The arch stones are supposed to he perfectly smooth or polished, and not to be connected by any cement, and thereſore to sustain each other merely by the equilibrium of their vertical pressuree The theory insures this equilibrium, and this only, leaving unnoticed any other causes oſ mutual action. The authors ho have written on the subject say expressly, that an arch which thus sustains itsell must he stronger than another which would not; because when, in imagination, we suppose hoth to acquire connection by cement, the first preserves the inſluence oſ this connection unimpaired; whereas in the other, part oſ the rohesion is wasted in counteracting the tendency oſ some parts to break oſſ ſrom the rest by their want of equilibrium. This is a very specious argument, and would be just, if the forces which are mutually exerted between the parts oſ the arch in its settled state were merely vertical pressures, or, where different, were inconsiderable in eompurison with those which are really attended to in the eonstruction. But this is by no means the case. The forms which the uses ſor which arches are erected oblige us to adopt, end the loads laid on the different points oſ the arch, ſrequently deviate considerably ſrom what are necessary for the equilibrium of vertical pressuress. The varying load on a bridge, when a great waggon passes along it, sometimes bears a very sensible proportion to the weight of that point oſ the arch on whieh it rests. It is even very doubtſul whether the pressuree which are occasioned by the weight oſ the stuff employed for filling up the ſlanks really act in a vertical direction, and in the proportion which is supposedlc. We are pretty certain that this is not the case with sand, gravel, ſat mould, and many substances in very general use ſor this purpose. When this is the case, the pressures sustained by the difſerent parts of the arch are oſten very inconsistent with the theorya part of the arch is overloaded, and tends to ſall in, but is prevented by the cement. This part oſ the arch, therefore, acts on the remoter parts, by the intervention of the parts between, employing those intermediate parts as a kind of levers to break the arch in a remote part, just as a lintel would be brokenn We apprehend that a mathematician would be puæzled how to explain the stability of an arch cut out of a solid and uniform mass oſ rock. His theory considers the mutual thrusts of the arch stones as in the direction of the tangents to the arTch Why so? because he supposes that all his polished joints are perpendicular to those tangents. But in the present case he has no existing joints; and there seems to be nothing to direet his imagination in the assumption oſ joints, which, however, are absolutely necessary ſor employing his theory, because, without a supposition oſ this kind, there seems no conceiving any mutual abutment oſ the arch stoness. Ask a common, but intelligent, mason, what notion he forms of such an arch? We apprehend that he will consider it as no arch, but as a lintel, which may be broken like a wooden lintel, and which resists entirely by its cohesion. He will not readily conceive that, by cutting the under side of a stone lintel into an arched form, and thus taking away more than halſ oſ its substance, he has changed its nature of a lintel, or given it any additional strength. Nor would there be any change made in the way in which such a mass of stone would resist being broken down, if nothing were done hut forming the under side into an arch. If the lintel be s0 laid on the piers that it can be broken witheut its parts pushing the piers aside (which will be the ease iſ it lies on the piers with horizontal joints), it will break like any other lintel; but if the joints are directed downwards, and converging to a point within the arch, the broken stone (suppose it broken at the crown by an overload in that part) cannot he pressed down without ſorcing the piers outwardss Now, in this mode oſ acting, the mind cannot trace any thing oſ the statical equilibrium that ve have proceeded on in the ſoregoing theory. The two parts oſ the broken lintel seem to push the piers aside in the same manner that two raſters push outwards the walls of a house, when their feet are not held together by a tye-beam. IF the piers cannot he pushed aside (as when the areh abuts on two solid rocks), nothing can press down the crown which does not crush the stone. This conclusion will be strietly true if the arch is oſ such a ſorm that a straight line drawn from the erown to the pier lies wholly within the solid masonry. Thus if the vault consist oſ two straight stones, as in Fig. I. PL. X. or if it consist oſ several stones, as in Fig. 14. disposed in two straight lines, no weight laid on the crown can destroy it in any other way but by crushing it to powder. 600. But when straight lines cannot he drawn ſrom the overloaded part to the firm abutments through the solid masonry, and when the cohesion of the parts is not able to withstand the transverse strains, ve must call the principles of equilibrium to our aid; and, in order to employ them with saſety, ve must consider how they are modiſied by the excitement oſ the cohering ſorees. The cohesion oſ the stones with each other by cement or otherwise, has, in almost every situation, a bad effect. It enables an overload at the crown to break the arch near the haunches, causing those parts to rise, and then to spread outwards, just as a Mansarde or Kirb roof would do if the truss-heam which connects the heads of the lower raſters were sawn through. This ean be prevented only by loading that part more than is requisite ſor equilibrium. It would be prudent to do this to a certain degree, because it is by this cohesion that the erown always becomes the weakest part oſ the arch, and suffers more by any oceasional load. We expect that it will be said in answer to all this, that the cohesion given by the strongest cement which we can employ, nay the cohesion oſ the stone itselſ, is a mere nothing in comparison with the enormous thrusts that are in a state oſ continual exertion in the different parts of an arch. This is very true; but there is another ſorce which produces the same effect, and which increases nearly in the proportion that those thrusts increase, because it arises ſrom them. This is the ſriction of the stones on each other. In dry freestone this ſriction considerably exceeds one half of the mutual pressure. The reſlecting reader will see that this produces the same effect, in the case under consideration, that cohesion would do; ſor while the arch is in the act oſ ſailing, the mutual pressure of the arch stones is acting with full force, and thus produces a ſriction more than adequate to all the effects we have been speaking of. 60I. When these circumstances are considered, we imagine it will appear that an arch, when exposed to a great overload on the crown (or indeed on any part), divides, oſ itselſ, into a number oſ parts, each of which contains as many arch stones as can be pierced (so to speak) by one straight line, and that it may then be considered as nearly in the same situation with a polygonal arch oſ long stones butting on each other like so many beams in a Norman roof, but without their braces and ties. It tends to break at all those angles; and it is not suſſiciently resisted there, because the materials with which the ſlanks are filled up have so little cohesion, that the angle ſeels no load except what is immediate- ly above it; whereas it should be immediately loaded with all the weight which is diffused over the adjoining vide oſ the polygon. This will be the case, even though the eurvilineal areh be perſectly equilibrated We tecolIect some circumstances in the ſailure oſ a considerable arch, which may be worth mentioning. It had been built of an exceedingly soſt and ſriable stone, and the arch stones were too short. Ahout a fortnight beſore it fell, chips were observed to be dropping oſf ſrom the joints of the arch stones about ten feet on each side of the middle, and also ſrom another place on one side of the areh, about: twenty ſeet from its middle The masons in the neighbourhood prognosticated its speedy downſal, and said it would separate in those places where the chips were breaking of. At length it fell; but it first split in the middle, and about 15 or 16 ſeet on each side, and ãlso at the very springing of the arch. Immediately beſore the ſalla shivering or erackling noise was heard, and a great many chips dropped down ſrom the middle hetween the two places ſfrom whence they had dropped a fortnight hefore. The joints opened above at those new places above two inches, and in the middle of the arch the joints opened below, and in about five minutes aſter this the whole came down. Even this movement was plainly distinguishable into two parts. The crown sunk a little, and the haunches rose very sensibly, and in this state it hung ſor about hal? a minutee. The arch stones of the erown' were hanging by their upper corners When these splintered ofſ, the whole ſell down. We apprehend that the procedure oſ nature was somewhat in this manner. Straight lines can be drawn within the arch stones ſrom A (Fig. 15.) to B and D, and ſrom those points to C and E. Each of the portions ED, DA, AB, BC, resist as if they were oſ one stone, composing a polygonal vault EDABC. When this is overloaded at A, A can descend in no other way than by pushing the angles B ànũd D outwards, causing the portions BC, DE, to turn round C and E. This motion must raise the points and D, àand cause the areh stones to press on each other at their inner joints b and d. This produced the eopious splintering at those joints immediately preceding the total downſal. The splintering which happened a fortnight bèfore, arose ſrom this circumstance, that the lines AB and AD, along which the pressure oſ the overload was propagated, were tangents to the soſſit of the arch in the points F, H, and G, and thereſore the strain lay all on those corners oſ the areh stones, and splintered a little from off them till the whole took a firmer bed. The subsequent phenomena are evident consequences of this distribution and modification of pressure, and cãn hordly be explained in any other way; st least not on ſhe theoretical principles already set ſorth; ſor in this bridge the loads at B and D were very considerably greater than what the equilibrium required; and we think tlat the ſitst observed splintering at H, V, and G, was most instruetive, showing that there was an extraordinary pressure at the inner joints in those places, which cannot he explained by the usual theory. Not satisfied with this single observation, aſter this way of explaining it occurred to us, and not being able to find any similar ſact on record, the writer oſ this article got some small models oſ arches executed in chalk, and subjected them to many trials, in hopes oſ collecting some general laws oſ the internal workings oſ arches which ſinally produce their downſal. He had the pleasure of observing the above mentioned cireumstances take place very regularly and uniſormly, when he overloaded the models at A The arch always broke at some place B considerably beyond another point F, where the first chipping had heen observed. This is a method oſ trial that deserves the attention both oſ the theorist and the practitioner. VOL. I. Ls IF these reſlections are any thing like a just account of the procedure oſ nature in the ſailure of an arch, it is evident that the ingenious mathematical theory oſ equilibrated arches is oſ little value to the engineer. We ventured to say as much already, and we rested a good deal on the authority oſ Sir Christopher Wren. He was a good mathematician, and delighted in the application of this science to the arts. He was a celebrated architeet; and his reports on the various works committed to his charge, show that he was in the continual habit of making this application. Several specimens remain oſ his ovn methods oſ applying them. The rooſ oſ the theatre of Oxford, the rooſ oſ the cupola oſ St Pauls, and in particular the mould on which he turned the inner dome oſ that cathedral, are prooſs oſ his having studied this theory most attentively. He ſlourished at the very time that it occupied the attention oſ the greatest mechanicians oſ Europe; but there is nothing to be found among his papers which shows that he had paid much regard to it. On the contrary, when he has occasion to deliver his opinion ſor the instruetion oſ others, and to explain to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster his operations in repairing that collegiate chureh, this great architect considers an arch just as a sensible and sagacious mason would do, and very much in the way that we have just now been treating it. (8ee Account of the Fumily of Wren, p. 356, &e) Supported thereſore by such authority, ve would recommend this way oſ considering an arch to the study oſ the mathematician; and we would desire the experienced mason to think oſ the most eſſicacious methods ſor resisting this tendency of arches to rise in the ſlanks. Unſortunately there seems to be no precise principle to point out the place where this tendency is most remarkable. We are thereſore highly pleased with the ingenious contrivance o Mr Mylne, the architect oſ Blackſriars Bridge in London, by which he determines this point vwith precision, hy making it impossible ſor the overloaded areh to spring in any other placee Having thus confined the ſailure to a particular spot, he with equal art opposes a resistance which he believes to be suſſicient; and the present condition of that noble hridge, which does not in any place show the smallest change oſ shape, proves that he was not mistaken. Looking on this work as the first, or at least the second; specimen oſ masonic ingenuity that is to be seen in the world, we imagine that our readers will be pleased with a particular aceount oſ ĩts most remarkable circumstances. 60”. The span k a (Fig. 16.) oſ the middle arch is I00 feet, and its height OV is 40, and the thickness KV of the crown is six ſeet seven inches:. Its ſorm is nearly elliptical; the part AVZ bęing an arch oſ a circle whose eentre is C, and radius, 4ſ ſeet, and the two lateral portions AlB and Z a E being arches described with a radius oſ 35 ſeet nearly. The thickness oſ the pier at a b is 19 ſeet. The thickness of the arch inereases from the crown V to Y, where it is eight or nine ſeett. All the arch stones have their joints directed to the centres of their curvaturee The joints are all joggled, having a cubic foot oſ hard stone let half woy into each. By this coutrivanee the joints cannot slide, nor can any weight laid on the erown ever break the arch in that part, iſ the piers do not yield; for a straight line ſrom the middle oſ KV to the middle of the joint YI is contained within the solid masonry, and does not even come near the inner joints oſ the arch stones. Thereſore the whole resists like one stone, and can be broken only by crushing it. The joint at Z is very nearly perpendicular to a line YF dravn to the outer edge oſ the ſoundation of the pier. By this it was intended to take off all tendency of the pressure on the joint d Z to overset the pier; ſor if we suppose, according to the theory of equilibration, that this pressure is necessarily exerted perpendicularly to the joint, its di- rection passes through the fulerum at F, round which it is thought that the pier must turn in the act of oversetting. This precaution was adopted, in order to make the arch quite independent oſ the adjoining arches; s0 that although any oſ them should ſall, this arch should run no risk. Still farther to secure the independence oſ the arch, the ſollowing construetion was practised to unite it into one mass, which should rise altogether. All helow the line a b ĩs built oſ large blocks of Portland stone, dovetailed with sound oak. Four places in each course are interrupted by equal blocks of a hard stone ealled Xentish rag, sunk half way in each course. These act as joggles, breaking the courses, and preventing them from sliding laterally. The portion a Y oſ the areh is joggied like the upper part. The interior part is filled up with large blocks of Kentish rag, forming a kind of toursed rubble-work, the courses tending to the centres oſ the archh. The under corner of each arch stone projeets over the one below it. By this form it takes fast hold oſ the rubble-work hehind it. Above this rubble there is construeted the inverted arch Ie G of Portland stone.? This arch shares the pressure of the two adjoining arches, along with the arch stones in Y o and in Gb. Thus all tend together to compress and keep down the rubble-work in the heart of this purt of the pier. This is a very useſul precaution; ſor it often happens, that when the centres of the arches are struck, beſore the piers are built up to their intended height, the thrust of the arches squeezes the rubblework, horizontally, aſter the mortar has set, but beſore it has dried and acquired its utmost hardness. Its bond is broken by this motion, and it is squeezed up, and never acquires its former firmness. Tſs is eſſectually prevented by the pressure exerted by the back of the inverted arch.  We have been informed, upon good authority, that this inverted arch does not exist in Blackſriars Bridge, and that it was inserted in the plams merely ſor the purpose oſ inspiring conſidence. E Above this counter arch is another mass of coursed rubble, and all is covered by a horizontal course oſ large blocks oſ Portland stone, hutting against the back oſ the arch stone ZI and its corresponding one in the adjoining arch. This course connects the ſeet oſ the two arches, preserves the rubble- work ſrom too great compression, and protects it ſrom sonking water. This last circumstance is important; ſor if the water which ſalls on the road-way is not carried off in pipes, it soaks through the gravel or other rubbish, rests on the mortar, and keeps it continually wet and soſt. It cannot escape through the joints oſ good masonry, and thereſore fills up this part like a ſunnel. Supposing the adjoining arch ſallen, and all tumbled off that is not withheld by its situation, there will still remain in the pier a mass oſ about 3500 tonss. The weight of the portion VY is about 2000 tons. The directions oſ the thrusts RY and YVF are such, that it would require a load of 4500 tons on VY to overturn the pier round F. This exceeds VY by 2500 tons; a weight incomparably greater than any that can ever be laid on it. Such is the ingenious construction of Mr Mylne. It evidently proceeds on the principles recommended above; principles hich have occurred to his experienced and sagacious mind during the course oſ his extensive practice. We have seen attempts by other engineers to withstand the horizontal thrusts oſ the arch by means of counter arches inserted in the same manner as here, hut extending much farther over thie main arch; but they did not appear to be well calculated for producing this eſſeett. A counter arch springing from any point between Y and V has no tendency to hinder that point ſrom rising hy the sinking of the crown; and such a counter arch will not resist the precisely horizontal thrust so well as the straight course of Mr Mylue.* * A Plan and Elevation, and a description oſ Bluckſriars Bridge, will be ſound in the Eninsvou Excreroræoia, Art. Bnibos, see ꝑ. 485 und 526. 603. There is another species oſ arch which must not be overlooked, namely, the Dour or CuroLa, with all its vorieties, which include even the pyramidal steeple or spire. : 604. It is evident that the erection oſ a dome is also a scientiſic art, proceeding on the principles oſ equilibration, and that these principles admit and require the same or similar modifications, in consequence oſ the cohesion and ſriction oſ the materialss At first sight, too, n dome appears a more difficult piece of work than a plain arch; but when we observe potters kilns and glasshouse domes and cones of vast extent, erected by ordinary bricklayers, and with materials vastly inferior in size to what can be employed in ecommon arches oſ equal extent, we must conclude that the circumstance oſ curvature in the horizontal direction, or the abutment of a circular base, gives some assistance to the artist. Oſ this we have complete demonstration in the case oſ the cone. We know that a vaulting in the form of a pent rooſ could not be executed to any considerable extent, and would be extremely hazardous, even in the smallest dimensions; while a cone oſ the greatest magnitude can be raised with very small stones, provided only that we prevent the hottom ſrom ſlying out, by a hoop, or any similar contrivance. And when we think a little oſ the matter, we sce plainly, that if the horizontal section be perſectly round, and the joints be all directed to the axis, they all equally endeavour to slide inwards, while no reason can be offered why any individual stone should prevail. They are all wedges, and operate only as wedgess. When we consider any single course, therefore, we see that it cannot fall in, even though it may be part oſ a curve which could not stand as a common arch; nay, we see that a dome may be construeted, having the convexity oſ the curve, by the revolution oſf which ĩt is ſormed, turned toward the axis, jo that the outline is concave. We shall aſterwards find that this is a stronger dome by ſar than if the convexity were outwards, as in a common arch. We see also that a cone may be loaded on the top with the greatest weight, without the smallest danger oſ ſorcing it down, so long as the bottom course is firmly kept ſrom bursting outwardss. The stone lanthern on the top of St Paul's cathedral in London weighs several hundred tons, and is carried by a briek cone of eighteen ĩnches thick, with perſect saſety, as long as the bottom course is prevented from bursting outwardss. The reason is evident: The pressure on the top is propagated along the cone in the direction of the slant side; and, so ſar ſrom having any tendency to break it in any part, it tends rather to prevent its being broken by any irregular pressure from foreign causes. 605. For the same reasons the octagonal pyramids, which ſorm the spires of Gothic architecture, are abundantly firm, although very thinn. The sides of the spire oſ Salisbury cathedral are not eight inches thick aſter the octagon is ſully formed.. It is proper, however, to direct the joints to the axis oſ the pyramid, and to make the coursing joints perpendicular to the slant side, because the projecting mouldings which run along the angles are the abutments on which the whole pannel dependss A considerable art is necessary ſor supporting those pannels or sides of the octagon, which spring from the angles oſ the square tower. This is done by beginning a very narrow pointed arch on the square tower at a great distance below the top; so that the legs oſ the arch being very long, a straight line may be drawn ſrom the top oſ the keystone of the arch through the whole arch stones of the legs. By this disposition ſhe thrusts arising from the weight oſ these four pannels are made to meet on the massive masonry in the middle oſ the sides oſ the tower, at a great distance below the springing oſ the spire. This part, being loaded with the great mass oſ perpendicular wall, is fully able to withstand the horizontal thrust ſfrom the legs of those arches. In many spires these thrusts are still farther resisted by iron bars which cross the tower, and are hooked into pieces of brass ſirmly hedded in the masonry oſ the sides. There is much uice halancing oſf this kind to be ohserved in the highly ornamental open spires; such as those oſ Brussels, Mechlin, Antwerp, &e. 6O6. It is now time to attend to the principle oſ equilibrium, as it operates in a simple circular dome, and to determine the thickness oſ the vaulting when the curve is given, or the curve when the thickness is given. Thereſore, let Bb A (Fig. 17.) be the curve which produces the dome hy revolving round the vertical axis AD. We shall suppose this curve to be drawn through the middle oſ the arch stones, and that the eoursing or horizontal joints are everywhere perpendicular to the curvee We shall suppose (as is always the case) that the thickness KL, HI, &e. oſ the arch stones is very small in comparison with the dimensions oſ the arch. Iſ we consider any portion HA h oſ the dome, it is plain that it presses on the course, of which HL is an arch stone, in a direetion b C perpendicular to the joint HI, or in the direction of the next superior element à b of the curve. As we proceed downwards, course aſter course, we see plainly that this direction must change, because the weight oſ each course is superadded to that oſ the portion above it, to complete the pressure on the course below. Through B draw the vertical line BCG, meeting à b, produced in C. We may take b c to express the pressure oſ all that is above it, propagated in this direction to the joint KI. We may also suppose the weight oſ the course HI. united in b, and acting in the vertical. Let it be represented by b F. II we form the parallelogram b FGC, the diagonal b G will represent the direction and intensity of the whole pressure on the joint XL. Thus it appears that this pressure is continually changing its direction, and that the line, which will always coincide with it, must he a curve concaye downward. Iſ this be precisely the curve of the dome, it will be an equilibrated vaulting; but so far from being the strongest ſorm, it is the weakest, and it is the limit to an infinity oſ others, which are all stronger than it. This will appear evident, iſ we suppose that b G does not coincide with the curve A h B, but passes without it. As we suppose the arch stones to he exceedingly thin from inside to outside, it is plain that this dome eannot stand, and that the weight oſ the upper part will press it down, and spring the vaulting outwards at the joint KL. But let us suppose, on the other hand, that b G ſalls within the curvilineal element b i. This evidently tends to push the arch stone inward, toward the axis, and would cause it to slide in, since the joints are supposed perſectly smooth and slipping. But since this takes place equally in every stone oſ this course, they must all abut on each other in the vertical joints, squeezing them firmly together. Thereſore, resolving the thrust b G into two, one of which is perpendicular to the joint KL, and the other parallel to it, we see that this last thrust is withstood hy the vertical joints all around, and there remains only the thrust in the direction oſ the curve Such a dome must therefore be firmer than an equilibrated dome, and cannot be so easily broken hy overloading the upper part. When the curve is concave upwards, as in the lower part oſ the figure, the line b C always ſalls below b B, and the point C helow B. When the curve is concave downwards, as in the upper part oſ the figure,b C passes above, or without  B. The curvature may be so abrupt, that even V G shall pass without'h B, and the point G be above B. It is also evident that the force which thus hinds the stones oſf a horiZontal course together, by pushing them towards the axis, will be greater in ſlat domes than in those that are more convex; that it will be still greater in a cone; and greater still in a curve whose convexity is turned inwards: for in this last case the line b G will de- viate most remarkably ſrom the curve. Such a dome will stand (having polished joints) iſf the curve springs from the hase with any elevation, however small; nay, since the frietion of two pieces oſ stone is not less than halſ of their mutual pressure, such a dome vill stand, although the tangent to the curve at the bottom should he horizontal, provided that the horizontal thrust be double the eight of the dome, which may easily be the case iſ it do not rise high. 607. Thus we see that the stability o? a dome depends on very diſſerent principles ſrom that of a common areh, and is in general much greater. It diſſers also in another very important circumstance, viz. that it may be open in the middle: for the uppermost course, hy tending equally in every part to slide in toward the axis, presses all together in the vertical joints, and acts on the next course like the keystone oſ a common arch. Therefore an arch of equilibration, which is the weakest oſ all, may be open in the middle, and carry at top another building, such as a lanthern, if its weight do not exceed that oſ the circular segment of the dome that is omittedl. A greater load than this would indeed break the dome by eausing it to spring up in some of the lower courses; but this lond may be increased if the curve is ſlatter than the curve oſ equilibration: and any load whatever, which ill not crush the stones to powder, may be set on a truncate cone, or on a dome formed hy a curve that is convex toward the axis; provided always that the foundation be eſſectually prevented ſrom ſlying out, either by a hoop, or by a sufficient mass oſ solid pier on which it is set. We have mentioned the many ſailures which happened to the dome oſ St Sophia in Constantinople.* We imagine that the thrust oſ the great dome, bending the eastern arch outward as soon as the pier began to yield, destroyed the half dome which was leaning on it, and * See the Eoinaunca ExcrcroræDIa, Art. Civin AncuirecrurE, Vol. VL P: 625. and Plate CLXXIII. of that work. En: thus, almost in an instant, took avay the eastern abutment. We think that this might have been prevented, without any change in the injudicious plan, if the dome had heen hooped with iron, as was practised by Michael Angelo in the vastly more ponderous dome of St Peters at Rome, and by 8ir Christopher Wren in the cone and the inner dome of St Paul's at London. 608. The weight oſ the latter considerably exeeeds 3000 tons, and they occasion a horizontal thrust which is nearly halſ this quantity, the elevation of the cone heing about 6. This being distributed round the circumſerence, oceasions a strain on the hoop u oſ the thrust, or nearly 2325 tonss. A square inch oſ the worst iron, iſ vell forged, will carry 25 tons with perſect saſety: therefore a hoop of 7 inches broad and 13 inches thick will completely secure this cirele from bursting outwards. It is, however, much more completely secured; ſor, besides a hoop at the base of very nearly these dimensions, there are hoops in diſſerent courses of the cone, which bind it iuto one mass, and cause it to press on the piers in a direction exactly vertica. The only thrusts which the piers sustain are those ſrom the arches oſ the hody oſ the church and the transeptss. These are most judiciously directed to the entering angles oſ the building, and are there resisted with insuperable force by the whole lengths oſ the walls, and hy ſour solid masses oſ masonry in the eorners. Whoever considers with attention and judgment the plan of this cathedral, will see that the thrusts of these arches, and of the dome, are incomparably better balanced than in St Peters chureh at Rome. But to return ſrom this digression. 609. We have seen that if b G, the thrust compounded of the thrust b C, exerted by all the courses above HILE, and iſ the force b F, or the weight of that course, be everywhere coincident with & B, the element oſ the curve, we shall have an equilibrated dome; iſ it ſallę within it, ve have a dome which will hear a greater Ioad; and if it ſfalls without it, the dome will break at the joint. We must endeavour to get analytical expressions of these conditionss Thereſore draw the ordinates bt, BDB, C d C. Let the tangents at b and V meet the axis in M, and make MO, MP, each equal to b c, and complete the parallelogram MONP, and draw OQ perpendicular to the axis, and produce b F, cutting the ordinates in E and e. It is plain that MN is to MO as the weight oſ the arch HA h to the thrust b c which it exerts on the joint KL (this thrust being propagated through the course HILK); and that MQ, or its equal b e, or à d, may represent the weight oſ the half AH. Let AD be called , and DB be ealled &. Then be =3, and e C = (because b c is in the direetion of the element à 5). It is also plain, that if we make El constant, BC is the second ſluxion oſ æ, or BC æ , and b e and BE may be considered as equal, and taken indiscriminately for . We have also b C æ Vſ  + 5. Let d be the depth or thickness HI of the arch stones. Then d Vi  +5 will represent the trapezium HL; and since the circumſerence oſ each course increases in the proportion of the radius v, d & /  +5 vill express the whole course. If ſ be taken to represent the sum or aggregate oſ the quantities annexed to it, the formula will be analagous to the ſluent of a ſluxion, and ſ dy  æ np will represent the whole mass, and also the weight oſ the vaulting, down to the joint HI. Thereſfore we have this proportion v d5./ 5 dyæ 45 =be: bF, =be: CG, =:d: C6, d æ = 4: Cõ. Thereſore cõ æ 5 ag7 5v It the eurvature of the dome be precisely such as puts it in equilibrium, but without any mutual pressure in the vertical joints, this value of CGG must be equal to CB, or to æ, the point G coinciding with B This, condition will be expressed by the equation iyſ  +5 l ay,/ x +5 =&, or, more conveniently, by VEEYE ſill ſ dy  æ +5° Pll But this form gives only a tottering equilibrium, independent oſ the frietion oſ the joints and the eohesion oſ the cement. An equilibrium, accompanied hy some firm stability, produced by the mutual pressure oſ the vertical joints, may be expressed by the ſormula ſ a æ y NEETE  o ay ſæ +5 +5 44 where t is some ill: dy vE; 4 5 x variable positive quantity, which increases when æ increases. This last equation will also express the equilibrated dome, if ? be a constant quantity, because in this t, case T IS = O. ayi sæ 5 5 ſay æ 450 +5 be greater than à, and CG must he greater than CB: Hence we learn, that figures oſ too great curvature, whose sides descend too rapidly, are improper. Also, ayi 74⸗ x Since a firm stability requires the shall since stability requires that ve have greater than ſ d æ4 à 4 v , we learn that the upper purt of the dome must not he made very heavy. This, by This vill evidently give a dome having stability; hecause the original ſormula lyæſ æ t will then he dy æ + ,1 .- . p a æ » greater than 2. This will give d =4 77. Each  +5 of these forms has its advantages when applied to para x ticular cases. Each of them also givesd2// viæ 45 when the curvature is such as is in precise equilibrium. And, lastly, if d be constant, that is, iſ the vaulting be oſ uniſorm thickness, ve obtain the form oſf the curve, because then the relation of à to æ and to vis given. The chieſ use oſ this analysis is to discover vhat curves are improper for domes, or what portions of given curves may be employed with saſety. Domes are generally built ſor ornament; and. we see that there is great room ſor indulging our faney in the choic:. All curves which are concave outwards will give domes oſ great firmness: They are also beautiſul. The Gothic dome, nhose outlinẽ is an undulated curve, may be made abundantly firm, especially iſ the upper part be convex and the lower concave outwards. ſThe chief diſficulty in the case oſ this analysis arises ſrom the necessity oſ expressing the weight oſ the incumbent part, d ag/ xe +5. This requires the measurement oſ the conoidal surſace, which, in most cases, can he had only by approximation by means oſ infinite serieses. We cannot expeet that the generality of practical huilders are ſamiliar with this branch oſ mathematics, and therefore will not engage in it here; but content ourselves with giving such instances as can be understood by such as have that moderate mathematical Enowledge which every man should possess who takes the name oſ engineer. The surſuce oſ any cireular jorton oſ a sphere is very easily had, being equal to the circle deseribed with a radius equal 1o the chord oſ halſ ihe arch. This radius is evidently = J7 æ 458. In order to discover what portion of the hemisphere may be employed (ſor it is evident that we cannot employ the whole) when the thiekness of the vaulting is uniform, ve may recur to the equation, or formula dyæ ſu +5 =ſ dy J æ + 5. Let a be the x radius of the hemispheree We have 2 UY5 and ] i a* b . ſ alu x= 3. Substituting these values in the ſormula, J—— , a* ꝗ ; we obtain the equation 5 Vàt  æ vi wè easily obtain the ſluent oſ the second member = a a Vovm &, and y = a V 7 Thereſore iſ the radius oſ the sphere he I, the half breadth oſ thè dome must not exceed Vi 3 V;, or 0,756, and the height will be 618. The arch ſrom the vertex is about 51 49. Much more of the hemisphere cannot stand, even though aided by the cement, and by the ſrietion oſ the coursing joints. This last circumstance, by giving connection to the upper purts, causes the whole to press more vertically on the course below, and thus diminishes the outward thrust; but it at the same time diminishes the mutual abutment oſ the vertical joints, which is a great cause of firmmess in the vaulting. A Gothic dome, oſ which the upper part is a portion oſ a sphere not exceeding 45 from the vertex, and the lower part is concave outwards, will he very strong, ni not ungraceſul. 610. But the public taste has long rejeeſed this form, and seems rather to select more elevated domes than this portion oſ a sphere; because a dome, when seen from a small distance, always appears ſlatter than it really iĩs. The dome oſ St Peter's is neorly an ellipsoid externally, of which the longer axis is perpendicular to the horizon. It is very ingeniously construeted. It springs ſrom the buse perpenditularly, and is very thick in this part. Aſter rising about 50 feet, the vaulting separates inſo two thin vaultings, whie gradually separate ſfrom each other. These two shells are conneeted together by thin partitions; which are very artificially dovetailed in hoth, and thus form a covering which is extremely stifſ, while it is very light. Its great stifſness was necessary for enabling the crown of the dome to carry the elegant stone lantherm with safety. It is a wonderſul performance, and has not its equal in the world; but it is an enormous load in comparison with the dome oſ St Paul's, and this even independent oſ the difſerence oſ size. Iſ they were oſ equal dimensions, it would be at least ſive times as heavy, and is not so firm by its gravity; but as it is conneeted in every port hy iron bars (Iodged in the solid masonry, and vell secured ſrom the weather by having lead melted all round them), it hids ſair to last ſor ages, if the foundations do not fail. If a cirele be deseribed round a centre placed anywhere in the transverse axis AC (Fig. I18. No. 1.) of an ellipse, 30 as to touch the ellipse in the extremities B, b, oſ an ordinate, it will touch it internally, and the circular arch Ba b will he wholly within the elliptical areh B A b. Thereſore, iſ an elliptical and a spherieal vaulting spring from the same huse, at the same angle with the horizon, the spherĩcal vaulting will be within the elliptieal, will he ſlutter and lighter, and thereſore the weight oſ the next course below will hear a greater proportion to the thrust in the direction oſ the curve; consequently the spherical vOL. I. ẽ. vaulting will have more stability. On the contrary, and for similar reasons, an oblate elliptical vaulting is preferable to a spheneal vaulting springing with the same inclination to the horizon. (See Fig. IS. No. 2.) 611. Persuaded, that what has heen said on the subject convinces the reader that a vaulting perſectly equilibrated throughout is by no means the hest form, provided that the base is secured from separating, we think it unnecessary to give the investigation oſ that form, which has a considerable intricacy; and shall content ourselves with merely stating its dimensions. The thickness is supposed uniform. The numbers in the first column of the table express the portion of the axis counted ſrom the vertex, and those oſ the second column are the lengths oſ the ordinates. The curve delineated in Fig. 19. is formed according to these dimensions, and appears destitute oſ graceſulness; because its curvature changes abruptly at a little distance from the vertex, so that it has some appearance oſ heing made up oſ different curves pieced together. But iſ the middie be oceupied by a lanthern oſ equal, or oſ smaller weight, this deſect will cease, and the whole will he elegant, nearly resembling the exterior dome oſ St Paul's in London. 612. It is not a small advantage oſ dome- vaulting that it is lighter than any that oan cover the same area. Iſ, moreover, it he spherical, it will aduit considerahile varieties oſ figure, hby combining diſferent spheress Thus, a dome may begin ſrom its hase as a portion of a large hemisphere, and may be broken oſf at any horizontal eoursè, and then a similar or a greater portion of æa malIer sphere may apring ſtom this course as n basa It Also bedrs being interseoted by cylindrieal vaultinga in every direction, and the intersections aræ exact cireles, and always have a plensing eſſect. It also anrings most pgraceſully ſrom the heads oſ small piers, or ſfrom the corners oſ rooms oſ any polygonal shape; and the arches formed by its intersections with the walls are always cineular and graceſul, forming very handsome spandrels in every position. For these reasons, Sir Christopher Wren enployed it in all his vaultings; and he has exhibited many beautiſul varieties in the transepts and the aisles oſ St Pauls, which are highly worthy oſ the ohservation of architects Nothing can be more graceſul than the vaultings at the ends oſ the north and south ſransepts, especially as finished oſſ in the ſine inside view published by Gwynn and Wale. 613. We conclude this article with ohserving, that the connection of the parts, arising from cement and from friction, has a great eſſect on dome-vaultingg In the same way as in common arches and cylindrical vaulting, it enables an overload on one place to break the dome in a distant placee But the resistance to this efſeet is much greater in domevaulting, because it operates all round the overloaded part. Hence it happens that domes are much less shattered by partial violence, such as the falling oſ a bomb or the likee Large holes may be broken in them without much affecting the rest; hut, on the other hand, it greatly diminishes the strength which should be derived from the mutual pressure in the vertical joints. Frietion prevents the sliding in oſ the areh which produces this mutual pressure in the veriical joints, except in the very highest courses, and even there it greatly diminishes itt. These causes make a great change in the ſorm which gives the greatest strength; and as their laws of action are still but very imperfectly understood, it is perhaps impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to determine this form with tolerable precision. We see plainly, however, that it allows a greater deviation ſrom the best ſorm than the other kind of vaulting, and domes may be made to rise perpendicular to the horizon at the base, although of no great thickness; a thing which must not be attempted in a plane archh The immense addition oſ strength which may he derived ſrom hooping, largely compensates for all deſects; and there is hardly any bounds to the extent to which a very thin dome vaulting may be carried, when it is hooped or framed in the direction oſ the horizontal courses.*  For ſull descriptions and drawings oſ the principal arches which have been made oſ cast iron, and ſor a New Theory oſ Arches, the reader i roſerred to the Eninsuncu Exccroræoia, Art. Buinor2. En. ON THE CONSTRUCTION OoF CENTRES FOR BRIDGES. Glà. Cevræn, or CENTRE, is a word horrowed ſrom the French name ceintre or cintre, given to the ſrame oſ timber by which the brick or stone of arched vaulting is supported during its erection, and ſrom which it receives its ſorm and curvature. 615. It is not our intention to deseribe the variety oſ constructions which may be adopted in situations, where the arches are oſ small extent, and where sufſficient foundation can be had in every part of it ſor supporting the frame. In such cases, the frequercy of the props which we can set up dispenses with much care; and a ſrame oſ very slight timbers, connected together in an ordinary way, will suffice for carrying the weight, and ſor keeping it in exact shape. But when the arches have a wide span, and consequently a very great weight, and when we cannot set up intermediate pillars, either for want oſ a ſoundation in the soſt bottom of a river, or because the arch is turned hetween two loſty piers, as in the dome oſ a stately cathedralwe are then obliged to rest every thing on the piers themselves; and the ſraming which is to support our arch heſore the keystone is set, must itsell be an arch, depending on the mutual abutment oſ its heams. One should think that this view of the construction of a centre, naturally derived from the erection it was to assist, would have heen suggested by the slightest consideration: but it has not been so. Vhen intermediate pillars were not employed, it was usual to frame the mould ſor the arch with little attention to any thing but its sliape, and then to cross it and reeross it in all directions with other pieces oſ timber, till it was thought 50 bound together that it could be liſted in any position, and, vhen loaded with any weight, could not change its shape. The ſrame was then raised in a lump, like any solid hody of the sume shape, and set in its place. This is the way still practised by many country artists, who, having no clear principles to guide them, do not stop till they have made a load oſ timber almost equal to the weight which it is to carry. But this artless method, besides leading the employer into great expence, is ſrequently fatal to the undertaker, ſrom the unskilfulness of the construction. The beams which connect its extremities are made nlso to support the middle by means oſ posts which rest on them. They are therefore exposed to a transverse or cross strain, which they are not able to hear. Their number must therefore be inereased, and this increases the load. Some of these cross strains are derived ſrom beams which are pressed very obliquely, and therefore exert u prodigious thrust on their supportss The beums are also greatly weakened by the mortisees which are eut in them to receive the tenons of the erossing beams: and thus the whole is exceedingly weak, eompared with what it might have been, by a proper disposition of the sume quantity of timher. 616. The principles ſrom which we are to derive this disposition are the general mechanical principles of carpentry, of which we have given already some account. These furnish one general rule: When we would give the utmost strength possible to a ſrame oſ carpentry, every piece should he so disposed that it is subjeet to no strain but what either pushes or draws it in the direction oſ its length; and, iſ we would he indebted to timber alone for the ſorce or strength oſ the centre, ve must rest all on the first oſ these strains; ſor when the straining ſorce tends to drow a heam out oſ its place, it must be held there by a mortise and tenon, which possesses but a very trifling foree, or by iron straps and bolts. Cases occur where it may be very difficult to make every strain a thrust, and the hest artists admit oſ ties; and indeed where we can admit a tie-beam connecting the two feet oſ our ſrame, we need seek no better security. But this may sometimes be very inconvenient. When it is the arch of a bridge that we are to support, such a tiebeam would totally stop the passage oſ small eraſt up and down the river. It would oſten he in the water, and thus exposed to the most ſatal accidents by ſreshes, &e. Interrupted ties, therefore, must he employed, whose joint or meetings must be supported hy something analogous to the king-posts of roof. When this is judiciously done, the security is abundantly good. But great judgment is necessary, and a very serupulous altention to the disposition oſ the pieces. It is by no means an easy matter to discern whether a beam, which makes a part oſ our eentre, is in a state ofſ compression or in o state of extension. In some works oſ the most eminent carpenters even of this day, we see pieces considered as struts (and considerable dependence had on them in this eapacity), while they are certainly perſorming the office oſ tiebeams, and should be secured accordingly. This was the case in the boldest centre, ve think, that has been exeeuted in Europe, that oſ the bridge oſf Orleans, by Mr Hupeau. Yet it is evidently oſ great consequence not to be mistaken in this point; for when we are mistaken, and the piece is stretched which we imagine to be compressed, we not only are deprived of some support that ve expected, but the expected support has become an additional load. 617. To ascertain this point, we may suppose the piers to yield a little to the pressure of the archstones on the centre ſrames. The ſeet, thereſore, ſly outwards, and the shape is altered by the sinking oſ the croonn. We must draw our ſrame anew for this new state oſ things, and nust notice what pieces must be made longer than bofore. All such pieces have been acting the part oſ tiebeams. But a centre has still another ofſice to sustain; it must Eeep the areh in its form; that is, while the load on the centre is continually increasing, as the masons lay on more courses of archstones, the ſrame must not yield and g0 out of shape, sinking under the weight on the haunches, and rising in the crown, which is not yet carrying any load. The ſrame must not he supple; and must derive its stiſſness, not ſfrom the closeness and strength oſ its joints, which are quite insignificant when set in competition with such immense strains, but ſrom struts or ties, properly disposed, which hinder any of the angles ſfrom changing its amplitude. G18. It is obvious, ſfrom all that has been said, that the strength and stifſness oſ the whole must he found in the triangles into which this frame oſ caorpentry may he resolvedl. We have seen that the strains which one piece produces on two others with which it meets in one point, depends on the angles oſ their interseetion; and that it is greater as an obtuse angle is more ohtuse, or an acute angle more acutee. And this suggests to us the general maxim,  to avoid as much as possible all very obtuse angles Acute angles, which are not necessarily accompanied by obtuse ones, are not so hurtſul; because the strain here can never exceed the straining force; whereas, in the case oſ an obtuse angle, it may surpass it in any degree. Such are the general rules on this subjeet. Although something oſ the mutual abutment oſ timbers, and the support derived ſrom ĩt, has heen long perceived, and employed by the earpenters in roofing, and also, doubtless, in the ſorming oſ centres, yet it is a matter oſ historieal fact, that no general and distinet views had heen taken of it till about the beginning oſ this century, or a little earlier. Fontana has preserved the figure of the ſrames on which the arehes oſ St Peter's at Rome were turned. The one employed ſor the dome is construeted with very little skill; and those ſor the arches oſ the nave and transepts, though incomparably superior, and of considerable simplicity and strength, are yel for inſerior to others which have heen employed in later times. It is much to be regretted, that no trace remains oſ the ſorms employed by the great architect and consummate mechanician Sir Christopher Wren. We should doubtless have seen in them every thing that science and great sagacity could suggest. We are told, indeed, that his centering ſor the dome oſ St Paul's was a wonder oſ ĩts kind; begun in the air at the height oſ I6O feet ſfrom the ground, and vithout making use oſ even a projecting corniche vhereon to rest it. 619. The eurliest theory oſ the kind that we have met vith, that is proposed on scientiſic principles, and with the express purpose oſ serving as a lesson, are two centres by M. Pitot about the heginning oſ this century. As they have considerable merit (greutly resembling those employed by Miclinel Angelo in the nave of St Peters), and aſſord some good maxims, we shall give a short account of them. What we shall deseribe under the name oſ a centre is; properly speaking, only one ſrame, truss, or rib, of a centree. They are set up in vertical plunes, parallel to each other, at the distance oſ 5, õ, 7, or 8 ſeet, like the trusses or main couples oſ a roof. Bridging joists are laid across themIn smaller works these are laid sparingly, hut of considerahle scantling, and are boarded over; but for great arches, a bridging joist is laid for every course of arch stones, with blockings between to Eeep them at their proper distances. The stones are not laid immediately on these joists, but heams oſ soſt wood are laid along each joist, on which the stone is lnid. These beams are aſterwards cut out with the chissel, in order to separate the centre from the ring of stones, which must now support each other by their mutual abutment. 620. The centre is distinguishable into two parts, ALLB (?Pl. XI. Fig. 1.) and LDL, which are pretty independent of each other, or at least act separately. The horizontal STrETCHER LL cuts the semicirele ADB half way between the spring and the crown of the arch; the arches AL, LD, being 45 each. This stretcher is divided in the same proportion in the points G and H; that is, GH is one half of LL, and LG, HL, are each onefourth oſ LL nearly. Each end is supported by Lwo Srrurs EI, GI, which rest helow on a SoLE oOr BeD properly supported. The interval between the heads oſ the struts GI, HE, is ſilled up by the STrRAINING BEAM GH, abutting in a proper manner on the struts (see CarrENTRY. The extremities L, L, are united in like manner by butting joints, with the heads oſ the outer struts. The Arcu MouLns AP, BP, are connected with the struts by cross pieces PQ, which we shall call BriniES, which come inwards on each side oſ the struts, being double, and are bolted to them. This may he called the Jower part of the frame. The upper part consists of the king-post DR, supported on cach side by the two struts or braces ML, ON, mortised into the post, and also mortised into the stretcher, at the points L, N, where it is supporteũ by the struts belov. The arches LD, LD, are connected with the struts by the bridles P, Q, in the same manner as below. 621. There is a great propriety in many parts oſ this arrungement. The lower parts or haunches oſ the areh press very lightly on the centress. Each archstone is lyimg on an inclined plane, and tends to slide down only with its relutive weight; that iĩs, its weight is to its tendency to slide down the joint as radius is to the sine oſ elevation oſ the joint. Now it is only by this tendeney to sſide down the joint that they press on the centering, which in every part of the arch is perpendicular to the joint: But the pressure on the juint, arising from this eause, is much less than this, by reason of the ſrietion of the joint. A block oſ dry freestone will not slide dovn al all; and thereſore will not press on the centering, iſ the joint be not elevated 35 degrees nt least But the archstones are not laid in this manner, by sliding them down along the joint, but are laid on the centres, and slide down their slope, till they touch the blocks on which they are to rest; so that, in laying the arehstones, ve are hy no means allowed to make the great deduetion from their weight just now mentioned, and which Mr Couplet prescribes (Mem. Acad. Par. 1729). But there is another cause which diminishes the pressure on the centres; each block slides down the planks on which it ĩs laid, and presses on the hlock below it, in the direetion of the tangent to the arch. This pressure is transmitted through this block, in the same direction, to the next, and through it to the third, &e. In this manner, it is plain, that, as the arch advances, there is a tangential pressure on the lower orehstones, which diminishes their pressure on the frame, and, iſ suſficiently great, might even push them away ſrom it. Mr Couplet has given an unalysis oſ this pressure, and shews, that in a semicircular arch oſ uniform thickness, none oſ the arch stones below 300 press on ſhe frames. But he, without saying so, calculates on the supposition that the blocks descend along the circumſerence oſ this ſrame in the same manner as if it were perſectly smooth. As this is far from being the case, and as the obstructions are to the last degree various and irregular, it ĩs quite useless to institute any calculation on the subject. A little reſleetion will convince the reader, that in this case the obstruetion arising ſrom frietion must be taken into account, and that it must not be taken into account in estimating the pressure oſ each successive course of stones as they are laid. It is enough that we see that the pressure oſ the lower courses of archstones on the frame is diminishedc. Mr Couplet says, that the whole pressure oſ a semicircular arch is but ꝗths of its weight; but it is much greater, ſor the reason just now given. 622. We have tried, with a well made wooden model (of which the circumſerence was rubbed with black lead to render it more slippery), whether any part of the wooden blocks representing the archstones were detached from the ſrame by the tangential pressure of the superior blocks; but we could not say confidently that any were 30 detachedlc. We perceived that all kept hold oſ a thin slip of Chinese paper (also rubbed with black lead) between them and the frame, so that a sensible force was required to pull it outt. From a combination of circumstances, which would he tedious to relate, we believe that the centres carry more than two-thirds oſf the weight of the areh beſore the keystone is set. In elliptical and lover pitched circular arehes, the proportion is still greater. It seems reasonahle enough, thereſore, to dispose the ſraming in the manner proposed by Pitot, directing the main support to the upper mass oſ the arch, which presses most on the ſrame. We shall derive another advantage ſrom this construction, which has not occurred to Mr Pitot. ] : There is an evident propriety in the manner in which he has distributed the supports oſ the upper part. The struts which carry the king-post spring from those points oſ the streteher where it rests on the struts helow: thus the stretcher, on which all depends, hears no transverse strains. It is stretched by the strut above it, and it is compressed in a small degree between the struts helow it, at least by the outer oness Mr Pitot proposes the straining beam GH as a lateral support to the stretcher, which may thereſore he oſ two pieces: but although iĩt doe; augment its strength, it does not seem necessary for it. The stretcher is abundantly carried hy the strap, which may and should suspend it ſrom the king-post. The great use oſ the straining piece is to give a firm abutment to the Inner struts, without allowing any lateral strain on the stretcher. N. B. Great care must he tuken to make the hold suſiciently firm and extensive hetween the streteher and the upper struts, so that its cohesion to resist the thrusts ſrom these struts may be much employed. . The only imperſection that we find in this ſrame is the lateral strains which are brought upoq the upper struts Ly the bridles, which certainly transmit to them part of the weight oſ the archstones on the curves. The space between the eurves and ML should also have heen trussed. Mr Pitots ſorm is, however, extremely stiſſ; and the causing the middle bridle to reach down to the stretcher, seems to secure the upper struts ſrom all risk oſ bending. This centre gives a very distinet view oſ the offices of all the parts, and makes thereſore a proper introduetion to the general subject. It is the simplest that can be in its principle, because all the essential parts are subjected to one kind oſ strainn. The stretcher LL is the only exception, and its extension is rather a eollateral eircumstance than a step in the general support. 628. The examination of the strength oſ the ſrame ĩs extremely easy. Mr Pitot gives it ſor an arch of 60 ſeet span, and supposes the arehstones 7 ſeet long. which is a monstrous thickness ſor so small an areh; 4 ſeet is an abundant allowance, but we shall abide by his construetion. He gives the ſollowing scantlings oſ the paris: The ring or circumſerence consists oſ pieces of oak I9 inches broad and 6 thick. The streteher LL is 12 inches square. The straining piece GH is also I2.by I9. The lower struts 10 by S. The king-post 12 by I2. The upper struts 10 hy 6. The bridles 20 by 8. These dimensions are French, which is about th Iarger than ours, and the superficial dimensions (by which the section and the ahsolute strength is measured) is almost ; th larger than ourss The eubie ſoot, by whieh the stones are measured, exeæeds ours nearly ; th. The pound is deficient about ,th. But since very nice caleulation is neither easy nor necessary on this subject, it is needless to depart ſrom the French measures, which would occasion many ſractional parts and a troublesome reduetion. The arch is supposed to be built oſ stone which weighed 160 pounds per foot. Mr Pitot, by a computation (in which he has committed a mistake), says, that only j;ths oſ this weight is carried by ſhe ſrame. We believe, however, that this is nearer the truth than Mr Couplet's assumption of àths, already mentioned. Mr Pitot ſarther assumes, that a square inch oſ sound ouk will carry 8640 pounds. By his language we should imagine that it will not carry much more: but this is very ſar below the strength of any British oak that we have tried; so ſar, indeed, that we rather imagine that he means that this load may be laid on it with perſeet security for any time. But to compensate for knots and other accidental imperfections, he assumes 7200 as the measure oſ its absolute force. He computes the load on each ſrame to be 707520 pounds, which he reduces to };ths, or 5556908 pounds. The absolute force oſ each of the lower struts is 516000 (at 7200 per inch), and that of the curves 518400. Mr Pitot, considering that the curves are kent from bending outwards by the areh stones which press on them, thinks that they may be considered as acting precisely as the outer sruts E. We have no objection to this supposition. G24. With these data we may compute the load which the lower truss can saſely bear by the rule delivered in our treatise on CARPENTRY. We thereſore proceed as follows: Measure off by a scale oſ equal parts a s5, a t, each 576000, and add t v 518400. Complete the parallelogram a v x s, and drav the vertical æ c, meeting the horizontal line a C in . Make c b equal to c a. doin æ, and complete the parallelogram a x b5. It is evident that the diagonal æ 5 will represent the load which these pieces can carry; for the line a v is the united force oſ the curve AP and the strut IE, and o s is the strength of IG. These two are equivalent to a æ; æ b ĩs, in like manner, equivalent to the support on the other side, and æ y is the load which will just balanee the two supporta a x and b æ. When æ y is measured on the same scale, it will be ſfound = 2850000 pounds. This is more than ſive times the load which actually lies on the ſrame. It is thereſore vastly stronger than is necessary. Halſ oſ each oſ the linear dimensions would have been quite sufficient, und the struts needed only to he b inches by 4. Ever this would have carried twice the weight,; and would have horne the loud really luid on it with perfect safety. VWe proceed to measure the strength of the upper port. The force oſ each strut is 432000, and that of the eurve is 5162003 thereforè, having dPpawn M » parallel to the strut ON, make M 0 æ 432000;, and Ml s = 482000 + 518100. Coniplete the. parallelogram M⸗ r 2. Draw the horizontab line r I cutting the vertiedl MC in &; and make ky =Mk. It is plain, ſfrom what was done ſor the lower part, that My will meãsure the lo;d which eain be carried by the upper partt. ſhis willl ie found  1160000. This is also greatly superior to the load; but not in so grèat a proportion as the other part. The ehieſ part oſ the lond lies on the uppèr gart; but the chieſ reãson of the difference is the greater. obliquity of the upper struts. This shortens the diagonal My of the porallelogram of ſorcess Mr Pitot should have adverted to this; and instead of making the upper struls more slender than the lower, he should have made thom stouter. : h The strain on the stretcher LL is not ealoulated. Tt is measured hy r l, when My is the lond actually lying on the upper part. Less than the sixth part ofithe oohesion oſ the stretcher is more than suſſicient ſor the horizontal thrust; and there is no difficulty of making the ſoot joints oſ the struts abundantly strong ſor the purpose. The reader will perceive that the eumputation just now given does not state the proportions oſ the strains uctually exerted on the diſſerent pieces, but the load on the whole, upon the supposition that each piece is subjeeted to a strain proportioned to its strength. The other caleulation is much more ecomplieated, but is not necessary here. : This eentre has a very palpable defect. If the piers 3hould yield to the load, and the ſeet of the centre fly out, the lower part will exert a very considerable strain on tſie stretcher, tending to break it across between N and L, and on the other side, HKF oſ the lower part is firmly bound together, and cannot change its shape, and vill thereſore act like a lever, turning round the point F. It will draw the strut HK avay from its abutment with GH, and the streteher will be strained across at the place between H and F, where it is bolted with the bridle This may be resisted in some degree by an iron strap uniting ON and HK; but there will still be a want oſ proportional strength. Indeed, in an arch of such height (a semicircle), there is but hittle risk oſ this yielding oſ the piers; but it is an imperſfection. 625. The eentre (Pl. XI. Fig. 2.) ĩs eonstructed on the same principle precisely ſor an elliptical arch. The caleulation oſ its strength is nearly the same also; only the two upper struts of a side being parallel, the parallelogram Ms r v (of Fig. .) is not needed, and in its stead we measure oſſf on ON a line to represent twice its strength. This comes in place of M of Fig. .—N. B. The calculation proceeds on the supposition that the short straining piece MM makes hut one firm body with the kingpost. Mr Pitot employed this piece, we presume, to separate the heads oſ the struts, that their obliquity might be lessened thereby: and this is a good thought; for when the angle ſormed by the struts on each side is very open, the strain on them becomes very great. The stretcher oſ this frame is scarſed in the middle. Suppose this joint to yield a little, there is a danger of the lower strut ON losing its hold, and ceasing to jom in the support: ſor when the crown sinks by the lengthening of the stretcher, the triangle O”RN of Fig. 2. will be more distorted than the space above it, and ON will be loosened. But this will not be the case when the sinking oſ the crown arises ſrom the mere compression oſ the strut⸗. vOL. I. 2u Nor will it happen at all in the centre, Fig. I. On the contrary, the strut ON will abut more firmly by the yielding of the ſoot of ML. The figure of this arch of Mr Pitot's consists of three ærches of circles, ench oſ 60 degrees. As it is elegant, ĩt will not be unacceptable to the artist to have a construction ſor this purpose. 626. Make BY  CD, and CZ æj CY. Describe the semicircle ZAY, and make ZS  ZE. S is the centre oſ the side arches, each of 60 degrees. The centre T oſ the arch, which unites these two, i is at the angle oſ an equilateral triangle STS. This construction oſ Mr Pitot's makes a handsome oval, and very near an ellipsis, but lies a little without §t. We shall add another of our own, which coincides With the ellipse in eight points, and ſurnishes the artist, by the way, a rule for drawing an infinite variety oſ ovals. Let AB, DE (ig. 2. No. 2) be the axes oſ an ellipse, C the centre, and F, f, the two foci. Make C b  CD, and deseribe a cirele A D b e passing through the three given points A, D, and b. It may be demonstrated, that iſ from any point P of the arch AD be drawn a ehord PD, and if a lIime PR r be drawn, making the angle DPR = PDC, and meeting the two axes in the points R and r, then R and r will be the centres oſ the cireles, which will form a quarter APD of an oval, which has AB and DE for its two axes. We want an oval which shall coincide as much as possible with àan ellipsis? The most likely method ſor this is to find the very point P where the ellipsis cuts the cirele AD b ee. The easiest way for the artist is to describe an arch of a cirele a m, having AB ſor iĩts radius, and the remote focus f for its centree Then set one foot of the compasses on any point P, and try whether the alistance PF ſrom the nearest ſocus F is exactly equal te its distance P m ſrom that circle Shiſting the foot oſ the compasses ſrom the point oſ the arch to another, will s00n discover the point. This being ſound, drav PD, make the angle DP r = PD r, and R and r are the centres vanted. Then make Cs  CR, and we get the contres ſor the other side. The geometer will not relish this mechanical construetion. He may thereſore procee as ſollows: Draw D d parallel to AB, cutting the cirele in d. Draw e d, cutting AC in N. Draw CG parallel to e A, and make the angle CG i æ AD e. Biseet CN in O, and join Oi. Make OM, OM' æ O4, and drav MP, MP perpendicular to AB. These ordinates will eut the cirele AD b e in the points P and P, where it is cut by the ellipsee We lenve the demonstration as a geometrical exercise ſor the dilettante. 627. We said, that this centering of Mr Pitot's resembiled in principle the one employed hy Michael Angelo ſor the nave and transepts oſ St Peter's chureh at Rome. Fontana, who has preserved this, ascribes the construetion oſ it to one of the name of San Galloo. A sketch of it is given in Fig. 8 It is, however, so much superior, and so diſſerent in principle, ſrom that employed for the cupola, that we cannot think it the invention oſ the same person. It is; like Pitots, not only divizible, hut really divided into two parts, of which the upper carries by much the greatest part of the load. The pieces are judiciously disposed, and every important heam is amply secured against all transverse strains. Its only ſault is a great proſusion oſ strength. The innermost polygon a g hb is quite superſluous, because no strain can force in the struts whieh rest on the angles. Should the piers yield outwards, this polygon vill be loose, and can do no servicee Nor is the triangle gi h oſ any use, iſ the kingpost above it he strapped to the tie-beam and straining ſil. Perhaps the inventor considered the king-post as æ pillar, and wished to secure the tie-beam against its crosæ strain. This centering, however, must be allowed to be very well composed; and we expect that the well-informed reader will join us in preſerring it to Mr Pitots, both for simplicity oſ principle, for scientific propriety, and for strength. . There is one considerable advantage which may he derived ſrom the actual division oſ the truss into two parts. If the tie-beam LL, instead of resting on the stretcher EF, had rested on a row oſ chocks formed like double wedges, placed above each other, head to point, the upper part of the centering might be struck independent oſ the lower, and this might be done gradually, beginning at the outer ends oſ the stretcher. By this procedure, the joints of the arch stones will close on the haunches, and will almost relieve the lower centering, so that all can be pulled out together. Thus may the arch settle and consolidate in perfect saſety, without any chance of breaking the bond of the mortar in any part; an accident which ſrequently happens in great arehes. This procedure is peculiarly advisable for low pitched or elliptical arches. But this will be more eclearly seen afterwards, when we treat of the internal movements of an arch of masonry. This may suſfice for an account of the more simple construetion oſ trussed centres; and we proceed to such as have a much greater complication of principle We shall take for example some construeted by Mr Perronet, a very celebrated French architeet. 628. Mr Perronets general maxim oſ construction is to make the truss consist o several courses oſ separate trusses, independent, as he thinks, of each other, and thus to employ the joint support of them all. In this construetion it is not intended to make use oſ one truss, or part of one truss, to support another, as in the ſormer ret, as is practised in the rooſs of St Paul's church, Co- vent Garden, and in Drury Lane theatree Each truss spans over the whole distance oſ the piers, and would stand alone (having, however, equilibrium). It consists of a number oſ struts, set end to end, and forming a polygon. These trusses are so arranged, that the angles oſ one are in the middle oſ the sides oſ the next, as when a polygon is inscribed in a circle, and another (of the same number oſ sides) is circumseribed by lines which touch the circle in the angles of the inscribed polygonn By this construction the angles oſ the alternate trusses lie in lines pointing towards the centre oſ the eurve. Kingposis are thereſore placed in this direction between the adjoining beams oſ the trussess. These king-posts consist of two beams, one on each side oſ the truss, and embrace the truss-heams between them, meeting in the middle of their thicknesss. The abutting beams are mortised, halſ into each half oſ the post. The other beam, which makes the base oſ the triangle, passes through the post, and a strong bolt is driven through the joint, and secured by a key or a nut. In this manner is the whole united; and it is expected, that when the load is laid on the uppermost truss, it will all butt together, forcing down the kingposts, and therefore pressing them on the beams of all the inferior trusses, causing them also to abut on each other, and thus bear a share oſ the loadlc. Mr Perronet does not assume the invention to himselſ; but says, that it was invented and practised by Mr Mansard de Sagonne at the great bridge of Moulins. It is much more ancient, and is the work of the celebrated physician and architect Perrault; as may be seen in the collection of machines and inventions of that gentleman published aſter his death, and also in the great collection oſ inventions approved oſ by the Academy of Sciences. It is this which we propose to examine. 629. Fig 4. represents the centering employed for thy Jridge of Cravant. The arches are elliptical, oſ 60 ſeet spun and 20 feet rise. The arch stones are four feet thick, and weigh 176 pounds per ſoot. The truss-beams were from I5 to I8 ſeet long, and their section vas 9 inches by  Each half oſ the king-posts was about 7 ſeet long, and its seetion ò inches by 8 The whole was of oak. The five trusses were 54 ſeet asunderr. The whole weight oſ the arch was 1350000 Ibs. which we may call 600 tons (it is 558.) This is about 11?9 tons for each trusss. We must allow near 90 tons of this really to press the trusss A great part oſ this pressure is borne by the four beams which make the ſeet of the truss, coupled in pairs on each sidee The diagonal oſ the parallelogram of forces drawn for these beams is, to one of the sides, in the proportion of 360 to 285. Thereſore say, as 860 to 285; so is 90 to 7l; tons, the thrust on each ſoot. The seetion oſ each is 144 inchess. We may with the utmost iaſety lay three tons on every inch for ever. This amounts to 4382 tons, which is more than six times the strain really pressing the foot beams in the direction of their length: nay, the upper truss alone is able to earry much more than its loadc The absolute strength of its foot-beam is 2l6 tons. It is much more advantageously placed; for the diagonal oſ the parallelogram of ſorees corresponding to its position is to the side as 435 to 285. This gives 58 tons for the strain on each ſoot; which is not much above the fourth part oſ what it is able to carry for ever. No doubt can thereſore be entertained of the superabundant strength of this centeringg. We see that the upper row oſ struts is quite sufficient, and all that is wanted is to procure stifſness for it; for it must be careſully kept in mind, that this upper row is not like an equilibrated areh. It will be very unequally londed as the work advances. The haunches oſ the frame will be pressed down, and the joints at the crown raised up. This must be resisted. Here then we may gather, by the way, a useſul lesson. CENTRES FOR BRIDGES. 79 Let the outer row oſ struts he appropriated to the carriage oſ the load, and let the rest be employed ſor giving stiſſness. For this purpose let the outer row have abundant strength. The advantages oſ this method are considerable. The position of the heams oſ the exterior row is more advantageous, when (as in this example) the whole is made to rest on a narrow ſoot: for this obliges us to make the last angle, at least oſ the lower row, more open, which increases the strain on the strut; besides, it is next to impossible to distribute the compressing thrusts among the difſerent rows of the truss beams; and a beam which, during one period oſ the mason work, is acting the part oſ a strut, in another period is hearing no strain but its on weight, and in another it is stretched as a tie. A third advantage is, that, in a case like this,, where all rests on a narrow ſoot, and the lower row oſ heams are bearing a great part of the thrust, the horizontal thrust on the pier is very great, and may push it asidee This is the most ruinous accident that can happen. An inch or two of yielding will cause the erown oſ the arch to sink prodigiously, and will instantly derange all the bearings oſ the abutting beams: but when the lower heams already act as ties, and are quite adequate to their oſſice, we render the ſrame perſectly stiſſ or unchangeable in its form, and take avay the horizontal thrust ſrom the piers entirely. This advantage is the more valuable, beeause the very circumstance which obliges us to rest all on a narrow ſoot, places the foot on the very top oſ the pier, and makes the horizontal thrust the more dangerous. But, to proceer in our examination of the centering oſ Cravant bridge, let us suppose that the king-posts are removed, and that the beams are joined by compass joints. Iſ the pier shall yield in the smallest degree, hoth rows of struts must sink; and since the angles (at least the outermost) oſ the lower row are more open than those of thy upper row, the crown oſ the lower row vill sink more than that of the upper. The angles of the alternate rows must thereſore separate a little Now restore the king-posts; they prevent this separation. Thereſore they are stretehed; thereſore the beams of the lower row are also stretched; consequently they no longer butt on their mortises, and must be held in their places by holtss Thus it appears that, in this kind of sagging, the original distribution oſ the load among the difſerent rows oſ beams is changed, and the upper row hecomes loaded heyond our expectation. If the sagging of the whole truss proceed only from the compression of the timbers, the case is difſerent, and we may preserve the original distribution of mutual abutment more accurately But in this case the stifſness of the frame arises chieſly from cross strainss. Suppose that the ſrame is loaded with arch stones on each side up to the posts HC, b c;: Fig. 4. the angles E and e are pressed down, and the beams EOF, e o F push up the point F. This eannot rise without bending the beams EOF, eo F; because O and o are held down hy the double king-posts, which grasp the heams between them. There is thereſore a cross strain on the beams. Observe also, that the triangle EHF does not preserve its shape by the connection oſ its joints; for although the strut beams are mortised into the king-post, they are in very shallow mortises, rather for steadying them than ſor holding them togethe. Mr Perronet did not even pin them, thinking that their abutment was very great. The triangle is kept in shape by the hase EF, which is firmly bolted into the middle post at O. Had these interseetions not been strongly bolted, we imagine that the centres oſ some of Mr Perroneſ's bridges would have yielded much more than they did; yet some oſ them yielded to a degree that our artists would have thought very dangerouss. Mr Perronet was obliged to load the crown oſ the centering with very great weights, increasing them as the work advanced to prevent the ſframes ſrom going out of fhape; in one arch oſ 120 feet he laid on 45 tons. Notwithstanding this imperſfection, which is perhaps unavoidable, this mode of ſraming is undoubtedly very judicious, and perhaps the best which can be employed without depending on iron vork. 630. Fig. 5. represents another, constructed by Perronet for an arch of 90 feet spun and 28 ſeet risee The trusses were 7 ſeet apart, and the areh was 4ſ ſhick; s0 that the unreduced load on each ſrame was very nearly 225 tons. The scantling of the struts was 15 by I2 inches. The principle is the same as that of the former. The chieſ difference is, that in this centre the outer truss-beam oſ the lower row is not coupled with the middle row, but kept nearly parallel to the outer heam of the upper rov. This adds greatly to the strength of the ſoot, and takes off much oſ the horiontal thrust ſfrom the pier. Mr Perronet has shewn great judgment in causing the polygon of the inner row oſ truss beams gradually to approach the polygon of the outer rov. By this disposition, the angles oſ the inner polygon are more acute than those oſ the outerr. A little attention will shew, that the general sagging oſ all the polygons will keep the nbutments oſ the lower one nearer, or exacily, to their original quantity. We must indeed exeept the ſoot- beam. It is still too oblique; and, instead of converging to the foot oſ the upper row, it should have diverged from it. Had this been done, this centre is almost perſect in its kind. As it is, it is at least six times stronger than was absolutely necessary. We shall have occusion to reſer to this figure on another occasion. 631. This maxim is better exemplified hy Mr Perronet in the eentering oſ the bridge oſ St Maxence, exhi- bited in Fig. 5. No. 2. than that oſ Nogent, Fig. 5. No: 1I. But we think that a horizontal truss-beam a b should have been inserted, in a subordinate manner, between the king-posts next the crown on each sidee This would prevent the crown ſrom rising while the haunches only are loaded, without impairing the fine abutments oſ c d, c d, when the arch is nearly completed. This is an excellent centering, but is not likely to be oſ much use in these kingdoms; because the arch itselſ will be considered as ungraceſul and ugly, looking like a huge lintel. Perronet says, that he preſerred it to the ellipse, because it was lighter on the piers, which were thin. But the ſailure oſ one arch must be immediately ſollowed by the ruin oſ al. We know much better methods of lightening the piers, 632. Fig. 6. represents the centering oſ the bridge oſ Neuilly, near Paris, also by Perronet. The arch has 120 ſeet span, and 30 ſeet rise, and is b feet thickk. The frames are 6 ſeet apart, and each carries an absolute (that is, not reduced to ;3 or to à) load of 350 tons. The strut beams are 17 by I4 inches in scantling. The king-posts are oſ I5 by 9 each halſ; and the horizontal bridles, which bind the diſſerent ſrames together in ſive places, are also 1 by O each hall. There are eight other horizontal binders oſ ò inches square. This is one of the most remarkable arches in the world; not altogether on account oſ its width, for there are several much wider, but for the ſlatness at the erown: for about 206 ſeet on each side oſ the middle it was intended to be a portion of a cirele of 150 feet radiuss. An arch (semicireular) oſ S00 ſeet span might thereſore be easily constructed, and would be much stronger than this, because its horiZzontal thrust at the crown would he vastly greater, and vould keep it more ſirmly united. The bolts oſ this centre are diſſerently placed ſrom those oſ the ſormer; and the change is judicious. Mr Perronet huad doubtless ſound by this time, that the stiffuess oſ his framing depended on the transverse strength oſ the beams; and thereſore he was careſul not to weaken them by the bolts. But, notwithstanding all his eare, the framing sunk upwards oſ I3 inches beforè the keystones weræ Iaid; and, during the progress oſ the work, the crown rose and sunk, by various steps, as the londing vas extended along it. When 20 courses were laid on each side, and about I6 tons laid on the crown oſ each ſrame, it sunk ahout àn inchh. When 46 courses were laid, and the erown loaded with 50 tons, it sunk about halſ an inch more. It continued sinking as the work advanced; and vhen the keystone was set it had sunk I3} inches. But this sinking was not general; on the contrary, the ſrame had risen greatly at the very hnunches, so as to open the upper part of the joints, many of which gaped an inch; and this opening oſ the joints graduãlly extended from the haunches towards the crown, in the neighhourhood of which they opened on the under sidee This evidently arose ſrom a want oſ stiſſness in the ſrame. But these joints closed again when the centres were struck, as will be mentioned aſterwards. We have taken particular notice of the movements and twisting oſ this centre, because we think that they indicate a deficiency, not only oſ stiſſness, but oſ ahutment, among ſhe truss-bèams. The whole has heen too ſlexible, because the angles are too obtuse: This arises ſrom their multiplitity. When the intercepted arches have so litſle curvature, the power of the loud to press it inward increases very ſast. When the intercepted areh is reduced to one half, this power is more than doubled; and it is also doubled when the radius of curvature is doubled. The king-posts should have heen ſarther apart near the erown; so that the quantity oſ arch between them should compensate ſor its diminished curvature. The power of withstanding any given inequality oſ Iond would thereſore have been greater, had the centræ consisted of ſewer pieces, and their angles of meeting been proportionally more acute The greatest improvement would have been, to place the foot of the lower tier oſ truss-heams on ſhe very foot oſ the pier, and to have also separated it at the head from the rest with a onger king-post, and thus to have made the distances of the beams on the ing-posts increase gradually ſfrom the erown to the springg. This would have made all the angles oſ abutment more acute, and would have produced a greater pressure on all the lower tiers when the fſrame sagged. 633. Fig. I. of Pl. XII. represents the centering of the bridge oſ Orleans. The arch has 100 feet span, and rises 30, and the arch-stones are 6 feet long. It is the construction of Mr Hupeau, the first architect of the bridge. It ĩs the boldest work oſ the kind that we have seen, and is constructed on clear principles The main abutments are few in number. Because the beams oſ the outer polygon ure long, they are very well supported by straining beams in the middle; and the struts or braces which support and butt on them, are made to rest on points carried entirely by ties. The inventor, however, seems to have thought that the angles of the inner polygon were supported by mutual compression, as in the outer polygon. But it is plain that the whole inner polygon may be formed oſ iron rodss. Not but that both polygons may be in a state of compression (this is very possible); but the smallest sagging oſ the frame will change the proportions oſ the pressures at the angles of the two polygons. The pressures on the exterior angles will increase, and those on the lower or interior angles will diminish most rapidly; s0 that the abutments on the lower polygon will be next to nothing. Such points could bear very little pressure from the braces which support the middle oſ the long bearings of the upper beams, and their pressures  CENTRES FOR BRIDGES. 655 must be horne chieſly by the joints supported by the king-posts. The king-posts would then be in a state oſ extension. It is diſficult, however, to decide what is the precise state oſ the pressure at these interior angles. 634. The history oſ the erection oſ this bridge will throw much light on this point. Mr Hupeau died beſore any oſ the arches were carried farther than a very few oſ the first courses Mr Perronet succeeded to the charge, and finished the bridge. As the work advanced, the crown oſ the ſrame rose very much. It was loaded; and it sunk as remarkably. This shewed that the lower polygon was giving very little aidc. Mr Perronet then thought the ſrame too weak, and inserted the long beam DE, making the diagonal of the quadrangle, and very nearly in the direction of the lower beam a b, hut ſalling rather below this linee. He now found the frame abundantly strong. It is evident that the truss is now changed exceedingly, and consists oſ only the two long sides, and the short straining beam lying horizontally between their headss. The whole centering consists now oſ one great truss a E e b, and its long sides a E, e b, are trussed up at B and . Had this simple idea been made the principle oſ the construction, it would have heen excellent. The angle a DE might have heen about 176, and the polygon ID c g h employed only ſor giving a slight support to this great angle, s0 as not to allow it to exeeed 1500. But Mr Perronet ſound, that the joint c, at the ſoot of the post E c, was about to druw loose, and he was obliged to holt long pieces oſ ſimber on each side oſ the joint, embracing both beams. These were evidently acting the same part as iron straups would have done; a complete prooſ that, vhatever may have been the original pressures, there was no abutment now at the point c, and that the heams which met there were not in a state oſ compression, but were on the stretch. Mr Perronet says that he put these cheeks to the joints lo stiffen them. But this was not their ofſice; because the adjoining heams were not struts, but ties, as e have now proved. We may thereſore conclude, that the outer polygon, with the assistance of the pieces, a b, DE, were carrying the whole loadc. We do not know the distance between the frames: but, supposing them seven ſeet apart, and the areh six ſeet thick, and weighing 170 pounds per ſoot, ve learn the loadc The beams were 16 inches squure. I we now calculate what they would bear at the same very moderate rate allowed to the other centres, we find that the beams AB and ab are not loaded to one-sixth oſ their strength. We have given this centre as a ſine example of what carpentry is able to perſorm, and because, hy its simplicity, it is a sort oſ text on which the intelligent artist may make many commentss. We muy see plainly that, iſ the lower polygon had been ſormed oſ iron rods, firmly bolted into the ſeet oſ the king-posts; it would have maintained ĩts shape completely. The service done by the beam DE was not so much an inerease oſ abutment as a discharge oſ the weight and oſ the pull at the joint æ Thereſore; in cases where the ſeet oſ the truss are necessarily confined to a very narrow space, we should be coreſul to make the upper polygon suſficient to carry the whole load (say by doubling its beams), and we may then make the lower polygon oſ slender dimensions, provided we secure the joints on the king-posts by iron straps which embrace a considerable portion oſ the tie on each side of the joint. 635. We are ſar from thinking that these centres are oſ the best kind that could be employed in their situation; but they are excellent in their kind; and a careſul study oſ them will tench the artist much of his proſession. When we have a elear conception of the state of strain in which the parts oſ a ſrame really are, we know what should be done in order to draw all the advantage possible from our materials We have said in another place, that where we can give our joints sufficient connection (as by straps and holts, or by cheeks or fishes), it is better to use ties than struts, because ties never bend. We do not approve oſ Mr Perronet's practice oſ giving his trusses such narrow feet. By bringing the foot of the lower polygon farther down, we greatly diminish all the strains, and throw more load on the lower polygon: and we do not see any oſ Mr Perronet's centres where this might not have been donee. He seems to aſfect a great span, to shew the wonders oſ his art; but our object is to teach how to make the best centre of a given quantity oſ materials; and how to make the most perſect centre, when we are not limited in this respect, nor in the extent oſ our ſixed poinis. 636. We shall conelude this series oſ examples with one where no such affectation takes placee This is the centering oſ the bridge at Blackfriars, Londonn. The span oſ the arch is 100 feet, and its height from the spring is about 48. The drawing Plate XII. Fig. 2. is sufficiently minute to convey a distinct notion oſ the whole construetionn. We need not be very partieular in our observations, aſter what has heen said on the general principles oſ constructionn. The leading maxim, in the present example, seems to be, that every purt of the arch shall be supported by simple truss of to legs resting, one on euch pier. H, H, &e. are called APRON PiECES tO Strengthen the exterior joints, and to make the nino as stiſſ in itselſ as possible. From. the ends oſ this apron-piece proceed the two legs oſ each truss. These legs are 12 inches square: They are not of an entire piece, hut oſ several, meeting in firm abutment. Some oſ their meetings are secured by the double king-posts, which grasp them firmly between them, and are held together by bolts. At other inter- sections, the heams appear halved into each other 7 æ practice which cannot but weaken them much, and would endanger their breaking by cross strains, if iĩt were possible ſor the ſrame to change its shape. But the great breadth oſ this ſrame is an eſſectual stop to any such change. The fact was, that no sinking or lwisting whatever was observed during the progress oſ the mason work. Three points in a straight line were marked on purpose for this observation, and were ohserved every day. The arch was more than six feet thick; and yet the sinking of the crown, heſore setting the keystones, did not amount to one inch. The centre employs about one-third more timber than Perronets great centre in proportion to the span of the arch; but the circumſerence increases in a greater proportion than this, because it is more elevatedl. In every way of making a comparison oſ the dimensions, Mr Mylne's arch employs more timber; but it is beyond all comparison stronger. The great elevation is partly the reason of this But the disposition oſ the timbers is also much more advantageous, and may be copied even in the low. pitched arches of Neuilly. The simple truss, reaching ſrom pier to pier for the middle point oſ the arch, gives the strong support where it is most oſ all wanted; and in the lateral points H, although one leg of the truss is very oblique, the other compensates for it hy its upright position. The chieſ peculiarity oſ this centre is to be seen in its base. This demands a more particular attention: but we must first make some observations on the condition oſ an arch, as it rests on the centering aſter the keystones are all set, and on the gradual transſerence oſ the pressure ſrom the boards oſ the centering to the joints of the archstones. 637. While all the archstones lie on the centering, the lower courses are also leaning pretty strongly on each other. But the mortar is hardly eompressed in the joints: and least of all in the joints near the crown. Suppose the arch to he Catenarean, or o any other shape that is perſectly equilibrated?. When the centering is gradually withdrawn, all the arehstones follow it. Their wedge-like form makes this impossible, without the middle ones squeeæing the lateral ones asidee This compresses the mortar between them. As the stones thus come nearer to each other, those near the crown' must descend more than those near the haunches, before every stone lias lessened its distante ſrom the next by the same quantity; for example, by the hundredth part oſ an inch. This circumstance alone must cause a nking in the crown, and a change oſ shape. But the joints near the crown are already more open than those near the haunchess. This produces a still greater change oſ form beſore all is settled. Some masons endeavour to remedy, or at least to diminish, this, by using no mortar in the joints near the crown. They lay the stones dry, and even ſorce them together by wedges and blocks laid between the stones on opposite sides oſ the crovn: They aſterwards pour in fine cement. This appears a good practicee Perronet rejects it, because the wedging sometimes breaks the stoness. We should not think this any great harm; because the ſracture will make them elose where they would otherwise lie hollow. But; aſter all our care, there is still a sinking of the erown oſ the arch. By gradually withdrawing the centering, the joints close, the archstones begin to butt on each other, and to ſorce aside the lateral coursess This abutment gradually increasing, the pressure on the haunches oſ the centering is gradually ũiminished by the mutual abutment, and ceases entirely in that course, which is the lowest that formerly pressed it: it then ceases in the course above, and then in the third, and so on. And, in this manner, not only the centering quitæ vOL. I. 2 the arch, gradually, ſfrom the bottom to the top, dy it oun retiring ſrom it, but the arch also quils the centering by changing its shape. Iſ the centering were now pushed up again, it would touch the arch first at the crown; and it must lift up that part gradually beſore it come again in contact with the haunches. It is evident, therefore, that an arch, built on a centre oſ a shape perſectly suited to equilibration, will not be in equilibrio when the centering is removed. It is thereſore necessary to form the centering in such a manner (by raising the crown), that it shall leave the areh of a proper form. This is a very delicate task, requiring a previous knowledge of the ensuing change oſ ſorm. This eannot be ascertained by the help oſ any theory we are acquainted with. But, suppose this attained, there is another difficulty: While the work advances, the centering is warped by the load Iaid on it, and continually inereasing on each sidee The first pressure on the centering ſorces down the haunches, and raises the crown. The arch is therefore less curved at the haunches than is intended: the joints, however, accommodate themselves to this form, and are close, and ſilled with morta. When the masons approach the middle of the arch, the frame sinks there and rises up at the haunches. This opens all the joints in that place on the upper side By the time that the keystones are set, this warping has gone farther; and the joints are open on the under side near the crown. It is true we are here speaking rather oſ an extreme ease, when the centering is very ſlexible; but this occurred to Mr Perronet in the two great bridges of Neuilly and of Mantz. In this last one, the crown sunk ahove a ſoot beſore the key was set, and the joints at the haunches opened above an inch above, while some nearer the crown opened near a quarter oſ an inch belo. G36. In this condition oſ things, it is a delicate business 6 strike the centering. Were it removed in an instant, all would probably come down; for the archstones are not yet abutting on each other, and the joints in the middle are open helow. Mr Perronet's method appears to us to he very judicious. He began ſo detach the centering at the very hottom, on each side equally, where the pressure on the centering is very slight. He cut away the blocks which were immediately under each archstone. He proceeded gradually upwards in this way with some seed, till all was detached that had been put out oſ shape by the bending of the centering This heing no longer supported, sunk inward, till it was stopped by the abutment which it found on the archstones near the crown, which were still resting on their bloekss. During part oſ this protess, the open joints opened still more, and looked alarming. This was owing to the removal oſ the load ſrom the haunches oſ the centering. This allowed the crown to sink still more, hy ſoreing out the archstones at the haunches. He now paused some days, and during this time the two haunches, now hanging in the air, gradually pressed in toward the centering, their outer joints closing in the meanwhilee The haunches were now pressing pretty hard on the archstones nearer the crown. He then proceeded more slowly, destroying the blocks and bridgings oſ these upper archstones. As soon as he destroyed the support oſ one, it immediately yielded to the pressurè of the haunch; and iſ the joint between it and the one adjoining toward the crown happened to be open, whether on the under or the upper side, it immediately closed on it. But in proceeding thus, he found every stone sink a little while it elosed on its neighhour; and this was like to produce a ragged sofſit, which is a deſormity. He thereſore did not allow them to sink so much. In the places oſ the blocks and bridgings which he had cut away, he set small billets, standing on their ends, between the centering and the archstones. These allowed the pendulous arch to push toward the erown without sensibly desconding; ſor the billets were pushed out of the perpendicular, and some oſ them tumbled down. Proceeding in this way, he advanced to the very next course to the keystone on each side, the joints closing all the way as he advanced. The last job was very troublesome; we mean the detaching the three uppermost courses ſrom the centering: for the whole elasticity oſ the centering was now trying to unbend, and pressing hard against them. He found that they were lifted up; for the joints beyond them, which had closed completely, now opened again below: but this job was finished in one day, and the centre sprung up two or three inches, and the whole arch sunk about six inches. This was an anxious time; ſor he dreaded the great momentum of such a vast mass oſ matter. It was hard to say where it would stop. He had the pleasure to see that it stopped very soon, settling slowly as the mortar was compressed, and aſter one or two days settling no moree This settling was very considerable both in the bridge at Neuilly and in that it Mantz. In the former, the sinking during the work amounted to 13 inches. It sunk six inches more when the blocks and bridgings were taken out, and I; when the little standards were destroyed, and I; more next day; so that the whole sinking of the pendulous arch was 93 inches, besides what it had sunk by the bending and compression of the centering*. The erown oſ the centering was an arch o a circle deseribed with a radius oſ I50 feet; but by the sinking oſ the arch its shape was considerably changed, and about 60 feet oſ it ſormed an arch of a circle whose radius was 244 feet. Hence Mr Perronet inſers, that a semicircle oſ 500 feet span may be erected. It would no doubt be stronger than this arch, because its greater horiZontal thrust would keep the stones firmer together. The sinking of the arches at Mantæ was not quite so great, but * Thewhole sinking oſ this arch was 23 inchos. En. every thing proceeded in the same way. It amounted in all to 204 inches, of which 12 inches were owing to the compression and bending oſ the centering. 639. In Fig. 5. No. I. may be ohserved an indication of this procedure of the masonry. There may be noticed a horizontal line a c, and a diagonal a h. These are supposed to be drawn on the masonry as it would have stood had the ſrames not yielded during the building. The dotted line AVc shews the shape which it took by the sinking oſ the centering. The dotted line oſ the other side was actually drawn on the masonry when the keystone was set: and the wavy black line on the same side shews the form which the dotted line took hy the striking oſ the centering. The undulated part of this line cuts its former position a little below the middle, going without it below, and falling within it above This shews very distinetly the movement oſ the whole masonry, distinguishing the parts that were forced out, and the parts which sunk inward. We presume that the practical reader will think this account of the internal movements oſ a stupendous arch very instructive and useſul. As Mr Perronet observed it to be uniformly the same in several very large arches which he erected, we may conclude that iĩt is the general process oſ nature We by no means have the confidence in the durability or solidity oſ his arches which he prudently professes to havee We have conversed with some very experienced masons, vho have also erected very great arches, and in very diſficult situations, which have given universal satisſaction; and we have ſound them uniformly oſ opinion, that an arch which has settled to such a proportion oſ its curvature as to change the radius from 150 to 24 feet, is in a very hazardous situation. They think the hazard the greater, because the span oſ the arch is so great in proportion to its weight (as they express it very emphatically) or its height. The weight, say they, oſ the haunches is too small ſor foreing together the keystones, which have scarcely any wedge- like ſorm to keep them ſrom sliding down. This is very good reasoning, and expresses very ſamiliar notionss. The mechanician would say, that the horizontal thrust at the crown is too smal. When we questioned them about the propriety oſ Mr Perronets method oſ removing the centering, they unanimously approved of its general principle, but said that it was very ticklish indeed in the executionn. The cases which he narrates were new to them. They should have almost despaired oſ suceess with arches which had gone so much out of shape hy the bending of the centres; because, said they, the slope oſ the centering, to a great distance from the crown, was so little, that the archstones could not slide outwards along it, to close even the under side oſ the joints which had opened above the haunches; so that all the archstones were at too great a distance ſrom each other; and a great and general subsiding oſ the whole was necessary for bringing them even to touch each other. They had never observed such bendings of the centerings which they had employed, having never allowed themselves to contraet the feet oſ their trusses into such narrow spaces. They observed, that nothing but lighters with their masts down can pass under the trusses, and that the sides must be so protected by advanced works from the accidental shock oſ a loaded boat, that there cannot he leſt room for more than one. They added, that the bridges oſ communication, necessary for the expeditious condueting oſ the work, made all this supposed roominess useſul: hesides, the business can hardly be so urgent and crowded anyvhere, as to make the passage through every arch indispensably necessary. Nor was the inconvenience oſ this obstruction greatly complained oſ during the erection of Westminster or Blackſriars bridges. These appeared to us good reasons ſor preſerring the more cautious, and incomparably more secure, eonstruetion oſ Mr Mylne, in which the hreadth given to each base oſ the trusses permitted a much more efſective disposition of the abutting timbers, and also enabled the engineer to make it incomparably stiſfer; so that no change need be apprehended in the joints which have already closed, and in which the mortar has already taken its set, and commenced an union that never can be restoræed iſ it be once broken in the smallest degree, no not even by greater compression. 640. Here we beg leave to mention our notions oſ the connection that is formed by mortar composed of lime or gypsum. We consider it as consisting chieſly, iſ not slely, in a crystallization of the line or gypsum and water. As much water is taken up as is necessary for the ſormation oſ the erystals during their gradual eonversion into mild calcareous earth or alabaster, and the rest evaporatess When the ſree access of air is absolutely prevented, the erystalliation never proceeds to that state, even although the mortar hecomes extremely dry and hard. We had an opportunity of observing this accidentally, vhen passing through Maestricht in 1770, while they were cutting up a massy revetment of a part of the ſortifications more than 300 years old. The mortar between the bricks was harder than the bricks (hich were Dutch clinkers, such as are now used only ſor the greatest loads); but when mixed with water it made it lime vater, seemingly as strong as if fresh lime had been used. We observed the same thing in one small part of a huge mass of ancient Roman vork near Romney in Kent; but the rest, and all the very old mortar that we have seen, was in a mild state, and was generally much harder than what produced any lime water. Now when the mortar in the joints has begun its first erystallization, and is allowed to remain in perſeet rest, we are confident that the aubsequent erystals, vhether oſ lime or oſ calcareous rarth, or of gypsum, will be much larger and strongeæ than can ever be produced iſ they are once broken;: and the ſarther that this crystalliation has been carried, that is, the harder that the mortar has become, less oſ it remains to take any new crystallization. Why should it be otherwise here than in every other erysialliation that we are acquainted with ? 641. We think thereſore that it is of great consequence to keep the joints in their ſirst state iſ possible; and that the strength (as ſar as it depends on the mortar) is greatly diminished by their opening; especially when the mortar has acquired considerable hardness, whieh it will do in a month or six weeks, iſ it be good. The tohesion given by mortar is indeed a mere triſle, when opposed to a ſorce which tends to open the joints, actin”, as it generally does, with the transverse force of a lever: but in situations where the overload on any particular archstones tends to push them down through hetween their neighbours, like wedges, the cohesion oſ the mortar is then oſ very great consequence. We must make another observation. Mr Perronets ingenious process tended very eſſectually to close the joints. In doing this, the ſforces which he brought into action had little to oppose them; but as soon as they were closed, the contact oſ the parts, formerly open, opposed an obstruction incomparably greater, and immediately balanced a force vhich was but just able to turn the stone gently about the two edges in which it touched the adjoining stones. This is an important remork, though seemingly very triſling; and we wish the practitioner to have a very clear conception oſ it; but it would take a multitude oſf words to explain it. It is worth an experiment. Form a little arch of wooden blocks; and form one of these so, that when they are all resting on the centering, it may be open at the outer JointItemove the centering—Then press on the arch at some distance from the open joint—You will find that a very small pressure will make the arch bend till that joint closePress a little harder, and the arch will bend more, and the next joint will openThus you vill find that, by pressing alternately on each side of the open joint, that stone can easily be made to ſlap over to either side; and that immediately aſter this is done the resistance increases greatly. This shews clearly, that a very moderate force, judiciously employed, will elose the joints, but nill not press the parts strongly together. The joints thereſore are closed, hut no more than closed, aud are hanging only by the edges by which they were hanging while the joints were open. The arch, thereſore, 4hough apparently close and firm, is but loose and tottering. Mr Perronet says, that his arches were firm, hecause hardly a stone was ohserved to chip or splinter ofſ at the edges hy the settlement. But he had done every thing to prevent this, hy digging out the mortar from between the headers, to the depth of two inches, with saws made on purpose. But we are well informed, that beſore the year 1791 (twenty yours aſter the erection) the arches at Neuilly had sunk very sensibly, and that very large splinters had ſlown oſf in several places. It could not be otherwise. 642 The original construction was too hold; we may say needlessly and ostentatiously hold. A very gentle slope oſ the roadway, which would not have slackened the mad gallop of a ducal carriage, nor sensibly checked the laborious pull of a loaded waggon, and a proper diſference in the size of the arches, would have made this wonderſul bridge incomparably stronger, and also much more elegant and pleasing to the eye. Indeed, it is ſar ſrom being as handsome as it might have heenn. The ellipse is a most pleasing figure to every beholder; but this is concealed as much as possible, and it is attempted to give the whole the appearance of a tremendous lintel It has the oppressive look oſ danger. It will not be of long duration. The bridge at Mantæ is still more execeptionable, because its piers are tall and slender. If any one of the arches ſails, the rest must ſall in a moment. An arch oſ Blackſriars bridge might be blown up without disturbing its neighbours. 643. Mr Perronet mentions another mode of striking the centering, which he says is very usual in Francee Every second bridging is cut out. Some time aſter, every second oſf the remainder; aſter this, every second of the remainder; and so on, till all is removed. This is never practised in this country, and is certainly a very bad method. It leaves the areh hanging by a number oſ distant points; and it is wonderſul that any arch can bear this treatment. 644. Our architects have generally proceeded with extreme eautionn. Wherever they could, they supported the centering by intermediate pillars, even when it was a trussed centre, having a tie-beam reaching ſrom side to sidee. The centre was made to rest, not immediately on these pillars, but on pieces oſ timber formed like acute wedges, placed in pairs, one above the other, and having the point oſ the one on the thick end oſ the other. These wedges were well soaped and rubbed with black lead, to make them slippery. When the centres are to be struck, men are stationed at each pair of the wedges with heavy mauls. They are directed to strike together on the opposite wedges. By this operation, the whole centering descends together; or, when any part of the arch is oserved to have opened its joints on the upper side, the wedges below that part are slackened. The ſraming may perhaps bend a little, and allow that part to subside. If any part of the arch is observed to open its joints on the under side, the wedges below that part are allowed to stand aſter the rest have been slackened. By this process, the whole comes down gradually, and æ slowly as we please, and the deſeets oſ every purt oſ the arch may be attended too. Indeed the caution and moderation of our builders have commonly been such, that few defects have been allowed to shew themselvess. We are hut little acquainted with joints opening to the extent of two inches, and in sueh a case would probubly liſt every stone oſ the arch againn. We have not employed trussed centerings so much perhaps as ve should have done; nor do we see their advantage (speaking as mere builders) over centres supported all over, and unchangeable in their ſorm. Such centres must bend a little, and require loading on the middle to keep them in shape. Their compression and their elasticity are very troublesome in the striking oſ the centres in Mr Perronets manner. The elasticity is indeed oſ use when the centres are struck in the way now described. These observations on the management oſ the internal movements oſ a great arch, will enable the reader to appreciate all the merit oſ Mr Mylne's very ingenious construction. We proceed thereſore to complete our description G45. The gradual enlargement oſ the hase oſ the piers oſ Blackſriars bridge enubled the architect to place a series oſ five posts C, C, C, C, C, Pl. XII. Fig. 2. one on each stap oſ the pier; the ingenious contexture oſ which made it like one solid block of stonee. These struts were gradually more and more oblique, till the outer one formed an obtuse angle with the lowest side oſ the interior polygon oſ the truss, On the top of these posts was laid a sloping sear or beam D of stout oak, the upper part of which was ſormed like a Zig-ag scarſing. The posts were not perpendicular to the under side of the seat. The angles next the pier vere somewhat obtuse. Short pieces of wood were placed hetween the heads of the posts (but not mortised into them), to prevent them ſrom slipping hack. Each ſace oſ the searſ was covered with a thick and smooth plate oſ copper. The ſeet oſ the truss were mortised into a similar piece F, which may be called the soLE oſ the truss, having ils lower side notched in the same manner with the upper side oſ D, and like it covered with copperr. Between these two lay the sTRiEING wEDGE E, the ſaces oſ which correspond exactly with the slant faces of the seat and the sole. The vedge was so placed, that the corresponding faces touched each other for about half oſ their lengthh. A block of wood was put in at the broad end or hase of this wedge, to keep it ſrom slipping back during the layĩng the archstones. Its outer end E was bound with iron, and had an iron bolt several inches long driven into it. The head of this bolt was broad enough to cover the whole wood oſ the wedge within the iron ferrule. We presume that the reader, by this time, ſoresees the use of this wedge. It is to be driven in between the sole and the seat, having first taken oul the block at the base oſ the wedge. As it advances into the wider spaces, the whole truss must descend, and be ſreed from the arch; but it will require prodigious blows to drive it back. Mr Mylne did not think s0, founding his expectation on what he sav in the launching oſ great ships, which slide very easily on a slope of I0 or I2 degrees. He rather feared, that taking out the hlock behind would allow the wedge to be pushed hack at once, so that the descent oſ the truss would be too rapid. However, to be certain oſ the operation, he had prepared an abundant force in a very ingenious manner. A heavy heam oſ oak, armed at the end with iron, was suspended from two points of the centre like a battering ram, to be used in the same manner. Nothing could be more simple in its structure, more powerſul in its operation, or more easy in its management. Accordingly the success was to his wish. The wedge did not slip back of itself; and very moderate blows of the ram drove it back with the greatest ease ral, and ſurnish a principle which will enable the intelligent and eautious artist to push ĩt with confidence as ſar as it can go. The general problem ĩs this. Suppose that a bridge is to be thrown over the spuce AB (Pl. XII. Fig. 3.), and that this is too wide for the strength of the size oſ timber which is at our command; how may this beam AB be supported with sufficient efſeet? There are but two ways in which the middſe point C (where the greatest strain is) can be supported: I. It may be suspended hy two ropes, iron rods, or wooden ties, DC, EC, made fast to two firm points D, E, above it; or it may rest on the ridge oſ two raſters d C, e C, which rest on two firm points d, e, below it. 2. It may be supported by connecting it with a point so supported; and this connection may he formed, either by suspending it ſrom this point, or by a post resting on it. Thus it may hang, by means oſ a rod or a king-post FC, ſrom the ridge F of two raſters AF, BF; or it may rest on the strut C f, whose lower extremity ſ is carried by the ropes, rods, or wooden ties A f, Bf. Whichsoever oſ these methods we employ, it ollows, ſrom the principles oſ carpentry, that the support given to the point C is so much the more powerful, as we make the angle DCE, or d Cę, or the equivalent angles AFB, or Af B, more acute. Each of these methods may be supposeũ equally strong. Our choice will depend chieſly on the ſacſlity oſ ſinding the proper points of support D, E, d, e; except in the second case, where we require no fixed points but A and B. The simple ſorms oſ the first case require a great extent of figuree Very rarely can we suspend it ſrom points situated as D and E. It is even seldom that we have depth enough oſ hank to allow the support oſ the ruſters d C, e C; but we can always find room ſor the simple truss APB. This thereſore is the most usually practised. 645. In the construetion, we must ſollow the maxims and directions prescribed in our articles CARPENTRY and Roor. The beams FA, FB, must be mortised into AB, in the firmest manner, and there secured with straps and bolts; and the middle must hang by a strap attached to the king-post FC, or to the iron rod that is used for a king-post. No mortising in the point C must he employed; it is unnecessary, and it is hurtſul, because it weakens the heam, and because it lodges water, and soon decays by rot. The best practice is not to suspend the beam immediately hy this strap, but to let it rest, as in Fig. . on a beam C, which crosses the bridge below, and has its other end supported in the same manner by the other truss. It is evident that the length of the king-post has no efſect on the support of C. We may thereſore contract every thing, and preserve the same strength oſ support, by finding two points a and b (Fig. b) in the hanks, at a moderate distance belov A and B, and setting up the raſters a F, b F, and suspending C from the shortened king-post. In this construction, when the heam AB rests on a cross hearer, as is drawn here, the struts a F, b F, are kept clear oſ it. No connection hetween them ĩs necessary, and it may be hurtful, by inducing eross strains on both. It will, however, greatly increase the stiffness of the wholee This construction may saſely be loaded with ten times the weight that AB can carry alone. 649. Suppose this done, and that the scantling oſ AB is too weak for carrying the weight which may be brought on the parts ACL, CBE. We may now truss up each half, as in Fig. 6. and then the whole will ſorm a handsome bridge, oſ the simplest construction possiblee. The intersections oſ the secondary braces with those oſ the main truss will ſorm a hand-rail oſ agreeablæ figure. We are not confined to the employment of an entire piece AB, nor to a rectilineal formm We may ſrame the bridge as in Fig. 7. and in this form we dissuade ſrom allowing any connection with the middle points of the main braces. This construction also may be followed till each beam AC and CB is loaded to ten ſimes what it can saſely bear without the secondary trussing. 650. There is another way by which a bridge of one beam may be supported beyond the power of the first and simplest construetionn. This ĩs represented in Fig. S. and Fig. . The truss beam FG should occupy onethird of AB. The advantage oſ this construction is very considerable The great elevation oſ the braces (hich is a principal element oſ the strength) is preserved, and the braces are greatly shortened. This method may be pushed still ſarther, as in Fig 10. G5l. And all these methods may be combined, by joining the constructions oſ Fig. S. and Fig. 9. with that of Fig. 10. In all of them there is much room ſor the display oſ ækill, in the proper adjustment of the seanſling oſ the timber, and the obliquity of the braces to the lengths of the diſſerent bearingss A very ohlique strut, or a slender one, will suſfice for a small load, and may oſten give an opportunity to incrense the general strength; while the great timbers and upright supports are reserved ſor the main pressures. Nothing will improve the eomposition so much as reſlecting progressively, and in the order oſ these examples, on the wholee This alone can preserve the great principle in its simplicity and ſull energy. 652. These constructions are the elements oſ all that can be done in the art of building wooden bridges, and are to be found more or less obviously and distinetly in all attempts oſ this kind. We may assert, that the more obviously they appear, the more perſect the bridge will be. It is astonishing to what extent the principle may be carried. We have seen a bridge oſ 42 feet span formed oſ two oak trusses, the biggest timber of which did not exceed six inches square, bearing with perfect steadiness and safety a waggon loaded with more than two tons, dravn by four stout horses. It was framed as Fig. 16. nearly, with the addition oſ the dotted lines, and was near thirty years old; protected, however, from the weather by a wooden roof, as many bridges in Germany are. We recollect another in the neigh bourhood of Stettin, which seemed eonstrueted with great judgment and spirit. It had a carriage-road in the middle, about 20 feet (ve think) wide, and on each side a foot-way about five feet wide. The span was not less than 60 feet, and the greatest scantling did not appear to exeeed I0 inches by 6. This bridge consisted of four trusses, two of which formed the outside of the bridge, and the other two made the separation between the carriage-road and the two ſoot-ways. We noticed the construction of the trusses very particularly, and found it similar to the last, except in the middle division of the upper truss, which, being very long, was double- trussed, as in Fig. IV. The reader vwill find in that volume of Leupold's Theatrum Machinarum, which lhe calls Theatrum Pontificum, many specimens of wooden bridges, which are very frequent in the champain parts of Germany. They are not, in general, models of mechanic art; but the reflecting reader, who considers them carefully, will pick up here and there subordinate hints, which are ingenious, and may sometimes be useſul. What ve have now exhibited are not to be considered as models oſ construction, but as elementary examples and VOL. I. 2 lessons, ſor leading the render systematically into a thorough conception of the subjęet 658. We cannot quit the subject without taking notice of a very wonderſul bridge at Wittengen in Svit7ærland, slightly described by Mr Coxe (Travels, vol. I. 1382.) It is oſ a construction more simple still than the bridges we have been describing The span is 230 ſeet, and iĩt rises only 25. The sketch (Fig. 18.) vill make it suſficiently intelligible. ABC is one oſ the two great arches, approaching o a Catenarian shape, built up oſf seven courses oſ solid logs of oak, in lengths of I2 or 14 feet, and 16 inches or more in thicknesss. These are all picked of a natural shape, suited to the intended curve; so that the wood is nowhere cut across the grain to trim it nto shape. These logs are laid above each other, s that their abutting joints are altemate, like those of a brick-wall; and it is indeed a wooden-wall simply built up, by laying the pieces upon each other, taking care to make the abutting joints as close as possiblee They are not ſastened together by pins or bolts, or by scarfings of any kind. They are, however, held together by iron straps, which surround them, at the distance of five feet from each other, where they are ſastened by bolts and keys. These two arches having been erected (by the help, we presume, of pillars, or a centering oſ some kind), and ell butted against the rock on each side, were freed from their supports, and allowed to settlee. They are so placed, that the intended road a b c intersects them about the middle of their height. The road-way is supported by cross joists, which rest on a long horizontal summer beam. This is connected with the arches on each side by uprights bolted into them. The whole is covered with a roof, which projects over the arches on each side, to deſend them from the weather. Three of the spaces between these uprights have struts or braces, which give the upper work a sort of trussing in that part. This construetion is simple and artless; and appears, by the attempt to truss the ends, to be the perſormance of a person ignorant of principle, vho has taken the whole notion from a sione arch. It is, however, of a strength much more than adequate to any load that can be laid on it. Mr Coxe says, but does not explain how, that it is so contrived that any part of it can be repaired independent of the rest. Tt was the last work of one Ulrich Grubenmamn of Tuſfen, in the canton of Appenzel, a carpenter vithout education, but celebrated for several works of the same kind; porticularly the bridge over the Rhine at Schafhausen, consisting of two arches, one of 172 and the other of 193 feet span, both resting on a small rock near the middle of the river.* While writing this article, ve got an account of a wooden bridge erected in North America, in which this simple notion of Grubenman's is mightily improved. The span of the arch was said to exeeed 250 feet, and its rise exceedingly small. The description we got is very general, but suſficient, we think, to make iĩt perfectly intelligible. 654. In Fig. 19. DD, EE, FF, are supposed to be three beams of the arch. They consist of logs of timber of small lengths, suppose of 10 or 12 feet, such as can be found of a curvature suited to its place in the arch without trimming it across ihe grain. Each beam is double, consisting of two logs applied to each other, side to side, and breaking joint, as the workmen term it. They are kept together by wedges and keys driven through them at short intervals, as at X, L, &e. The mammer of joining and strongly binding the two side pieces of each beam is shown in Fig. 20. The mortise * Drawings of this remarkable bridge, which is now destroyed, will be found in the EpiNauRGH ENCYCLOPæDIA, VOl. IV. ꝑ. 855, Plates LXXXIX and XC.Ebp. ai ch and de i o, hich is cut in each half beam, is considerably longer on the outside than on the inside, where the two mortises meet. Two keys, BB and CC, are formed, each vith a noteh b c d, or a i o, on its side; which noteh ſits one end of the mortise. The inner side of the key is straight, but so ſormed, that when both keys are in their places, they leave a space between them vider at one end than at the other. A wedge AA, having the same taper as the space just mentioned, is put into it and driven hard. It is evident that this must hold the two logs firmly together. DThis is a way of uniting timber not mentioned in the artiele CARPENTEY; and it has some peculiarities worthy of notice. In the first place, it may be employed so as to produce a very strong lateral connexion, and would then co-operate finely with the other artificial methods of scarfing and tabling that we described in the article referred to. But it requires nice attention to some circumstances of construetion to secure this effect. If the joints are accurately formed to each other, as if the whole had been one piece divided by an infinitely thin saw, this manner oſ joining will keep them all in their places. But no driving of the wedge AA vill make them firmer, or cause one piece to press hard on the other. If the abutment of two parts of the half beam is already close, it will remain 50; but if open in the smallest degree, the driving oſ the wedge ill not make it tighter. In this respect, therefore, it is not s0 proper as the forms described in CaꝶPENTRY. In order that the method now deseribed may have the effect of drawing the halves of the beams together, and of keeping them hard squeezed on each other, the joints must be made so as not to correspond exactly. The prominent angle a i o Fig. 21.), formed by the ends of the two half mortises, must be made a little more obtuse than the angle a fo of the notch of the key which this prominence is in- tended to fill up. Moreover, the opposite side e ? of this key should not be quite straight, but a very little convex. With these precautions, it is easy to see that, by driving the wedge AA, we cause the notch a fo to take hold, first at the two points a and o, and then, by continuing to drive the wedge, the sides a 7, of, of the notch gradually compress the wood of the half beams, and press them on each other. By continuing to drive the wedge, the mutual compression of the key and the beam squeezes all together, and the space a fo i is completely ſilled up. We may see, from this process, that the mutual compression and draving together of the timber will be greater in proportion as ve make the angle a i o more prominent, and its corresponding angle a fo more deep; always taking care that the key shall be thick enough not to break in the narrow part. This adjustment of the keys to the mortise is necessary on another account. Supposing the joints to ſit each other exactly before driving the wedge, and that the whole shrinks a little by dryingby this the angle a i o will become more prominent, and. the angle a fo vill become more shallow; the joint will open at a and o, and the mutual compression will be at an end. We may also observe, that this method vill not give any additional firmness to the abutments oſ the diſferent lengths employed to piece out the arch-beam; in which respect it diſfers materially ſfrom the other modes of joining Having shown how each beam is pieced together, ve must now show how a number of them are united, so as to compose an arch of any thickness. This is done in the very same way. The beams have other mortises worked out of their inner sides, half out oſ each half of the beam. The ends oſ the mortises are ſormed in the same way with those already describedl. Long keys BB, CC, (Fig. 19.) are made to ſit them properly, the notches being placed so as to keep the beams at a proper distanee from each other. Ii is now plain that driving in a long wedge AA vill binãd all together. In this manner may an arch be extended to any span, and made of any thickness of arching. The bridge over Portsmouth river, in North Ameriea, was more than 250 feet in length, and consisted of several parallel arches of beams. The inventor (7e think that his name is Bludget) said that he found the strength so great, that he could with perfect confidence make one of four times the span. We admire the ingenuity of this construction, and think it very effectual for bringing the timbers into ſirm and uniform abutment; but we imagine that it requires equilibration, because it is extremely ſlexible There is nothing to keep it from bending, by an inequality of load, but the transverse strength of the beams. The keys and wedges can have very little power to prevent this bending. The distance between the beams vill also contribute little or nothing to the stiſfness; nay, ve imagine that a great distance between them vill make the frame more flexible Could the beams be placed s0 near each other that they could be somehow joggled on each other, the whole would be stiffer; but at present they will bend like the plates oſ a coach-spring. But nothing hinders us from adding diagonal pieces to this construction, which will give it any degree of stiſſness, and vill enable it to bear any inequality of loading When completed in this manner, ve imagine that it will be at least equal to any construction that has been yet thought of. One advantage it possesses that is very precious: any piece that fails may be taken out, and replaced by another, without disturbing the rest, and vithout the smallest risk On the whole, we think it a very valuable addition to British carpentry. The method here practised, both for joining the parts of one beam and for framing the difſerent beams together, suggests the most firm and light construetions for dome-rooſs that can be conceived; incomparably superior to any that have yet been erected. The whole may be framed, without a nail or a spike, into one net-like shell that canmot even be pulled in piecess We may perhaps consider this in another article; at present we return to the congideration of trussed When the width of the river exceeds what is thought practicable by a single truss, we must then combine, either by simple addition or hy composition, diſferent trusses together. We compose a bridge by simple addition when we make a frame of carpentry of an unchangeable and proper shape, to serve as one of the arch-stones of a bridge of masonry. This may be easily comprehended by looking at Fig. 22. Each oſ the frames A, B, C, D, must be cnsidered as a separate body, and all are supported by their mutual abutment. The nature of the thing is not changed, although we supposæ that the rails of the frame B, instead of being mortised into an upright & ' unconnected vith the ſrame C, is mortised into the upright c c of that frame, the direetion and intensity of the mutual pressures oſ the two frames are the same in hoth cases; accordingly this is a very common ſorm oſ small wooden bridges. It is usual, indeed, to put diagonal battens into each: but we believe that this is more ſrequently done to please the eye than to produce an unalterable shape of each frame. To an unskilſul carpenter this bridge does not seem essentially different ſrom the centering of Mr Hupeau for the bridge of Orleans; and indeed, in many cases, it requires reflection, and sometimes very minute reſlection, to distinguish hetween a construction which is only an addition of frame to frame till the width be covered, from a construetion where one frame works on the adjoining one transversely, pushing it in one part and drawing it in another. The ready way for an unlettered artist to form a just notion of this point, is to examine whether he may saw through the connecting piece & V from one end to the other, and make them two separate frames. Whenever this cannot be done vithout that part opening, it is a construetion by compositionn. Some of the beams are on the stretch; and iron straps, extending along both pieces, are necessary for securing the joint. The bridge is no longer a piece of masonry, but a performance of pure carpentry, depending on principles peculiar to that art. Equilibration is necessary in the first construetion; but, in the second, any inequality of loading is made ineffectual for hurting the edifice, by means of the stretch that is made to operate on some other piec. We are of opnion that this most simple employment of the distinguishing principle of earpentry, by which the beams are made to act as ties, will give the most perfect construction of a wide bridgee One polygon alone should contain the whole of the abutments; and one other polygon should consist entirely of ties; and the beams which form the radii, connecting the angles of the two polygons, complete the wholee By confining the attention to these two simple objects, the abutments of the outer polygon, and the joints of the inner one, may be formed in the most simple and eſficient manner, without any collateral connexions and dependencies, which divide the attention, increase the complieation, and commonly produce unexpeeted and hurtful strains. It was ſor this renson that we have so frequently recommended the centering oſf the bridge of Orleans. Its office will be completely perſormed by a truss of the form of Fig. 23; where the polygon ABCDEF, consisting of two layers of beams (if one is not sufficient), contains the whole abutments, and the other A b c d æ F is nothing but an iron rod. In this construction, the obtuseness of the angles of the lower polygon is rather an advantage. The braces G c, G d, which are wanted for trussing the middle of the outer beams, vill eſfectually secure the angles of the exterior polygon against all risk of change. The reader must perceive that we have now terminated in the construction of the Norman roof. We inm deed think it the best general form, when some moderate declivity is not an insuperable objection. When this is the case, we recommend the general plan of the centering of the bridge of Orleanss We would make the bridge (ve speak of a great bridge) consist of four trusses; two to serve as the outsides of the bridge, and two inner trusses, separating the carriage-way from the foot-pathss. The road should follow the course of the lower polygon, and the main truss should form the railss Tt might look strange; but we are here speaking of strength; and evident, but not unvieldy, strength, once it becomes familiar, is the surest source of beauty in all works of this kind.
