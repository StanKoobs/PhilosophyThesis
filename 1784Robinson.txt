The primary planets and comets deſcribe round the ſun, and the ſecondary planets deſcribe round their primary planets, areas proportional to the times. 2. The planets deſcribe ellipſes, having the ſun or primary planet in one of the ſoci. 3. The ſquares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean diſtances. The planets are retained in their orbits round the ſun Ly a force directed to the ſun, and inverſely proportional to the ſquare oſ the diſtances from him. The ſecondary planets are retained in their orbits round their reſpective primary planets by forces directed to them, and varying according to the ſame law. They are alſo made to accompany theĩr primary planets by a force directed to the ſun, and varying according to the ſame law. This ſorce is mutual between the planets and the ſun, and between the ſecondary planets and their primaries. The planets are alſo actuated by ſorces directed to each other, and varying according to the ſame la. , The ſorce by which the moon is retained in her orbit round the earth, is nowiſe different ſrom the weight or gravity of common terreſtrial matter. This is found to be directed, not to the centre of the earth, but to every part of it. Hence it was juſtly inſerred by the illuſtrious Sir Iſaac Newton, that every particle of matter gravitates to every particle oſf matter, with a force inverſely proportional to the ſquare of the diſtanceQuantity oſ matter in the ſun, and in ſome oſ the planets.

A heavy body, near the ſurface of the earth, falls with a motion which is uniformly accelerated. If projected directly upwards, it riſes with a motion uniformly retarded.

This motion is ſo much affected by the reſiſtance of the air, that the theory is ſcarcely of anj uſe for directing the practice. S E C T. II. It is highly probable that the particles of tangible matter are not in contact, but are connected by mechanical forces, which, like gravity, act at a diſtance.

Iſt, If a fluid without weight be contained in any veſſel having two orifices, to which are applied two external forces, an equilibrium will obtain, if the forces are in the proportion of the orifices to which they are applicd. Prop. 2d, The preſſure on the horizontal bottom of a veſſel filled with a hcavy fluid, of which the upper ſurface is horizontal, is equal to the weight oſ a column of that fluid, having the bottom for its baſe, and the depth of the bottom under the ſurſace of the ſluid for its height. This preſſure is independent oſ the figure of the veiſel, and of the quantity of fluid which it contains. Prop. 3d, Any ſurface immerſed in a heavy fluid, of which the upper ſurface is horizontal, is perpendicularly preſſed with a ſorce equal to the weight oſf a column of that fluid, having the ſurface preſſed for its baſe, and the depth of its centre under the ſurface of the fluid for its height. Prop. 4th, The vertical preſſure on any ſurface immerſed in a heavy fluid, having a horizontal ſurface, is equal to the weight of the vertical column which may be incumbent on that ſurface.
